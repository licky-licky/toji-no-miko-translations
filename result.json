It's Yamashiro.\r\nYui: Things are kind of a mess right now, so I'm just leaving you a message.\r\nYui: ............\r\nYui: ...Mihono-chan... got put in confinement. They said, we won't get to see her again...\r\nYui: What should I do, Hana-san...\r\n\r\nHana: What do you mean, Mihono got put in confinement!?\r\nYui: Ah-- Hana-san...\r\nMirja: It's been some time, Suzumoto Hana. You finally came to see us.\r\nHana: Mirja-senpai... I still don't know... how I'm supposed to face all of you...\r\nHana: But still...!\r\nHana: I heard that Mihono got put in confinement... Does it have to do with that great aradama!?\r\nMirja: ...Did Yamashiro Yui tell you about that?\r\nYui: ...I'm sorry. I felt like, I should let Hana-san know...\r\nMirja: I don't mean to criticize you for it.\r\nMirja: ...It makes this conversation quicker. Asakura Mihono is in a state where there's no telling when the great aradama's power will run rampant.\r\nMirja: You understand the danger of the situation... don't you?\r\nHana: I do...\r\nMirja: When Asakura Mihono lost control of the great aradama's power, it was decided that she would be put in confinement.\r\nHana: She lost control!? How's Mihono doing!?\r\nMirja: ...She's fine, for now.\r\nHana: Thank goodness...\r\nHana: ...? By the way, where's the rest of the investigation team?\r\nMirja: Ban Tsugumi is at her research lab.\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki and Musumi Kiyoka... went to the Ministry of Defense. Setouchi Chie joined them, to make sure they didn't do anything unreasonable.\r\nMirja: ...Though, as I see it, Setouchi Chie herself is the one most likely to be unreasonable...\r\nHana: The Ministry of Defense?\r\nMirja: Do you remember the facility where Takirihime was held in custody?\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono has been quarantined in that same facility.\r\nHana: ...Alright. I'm going to the Ministry of Defense too.\r\nMirja: There's no point in going.\r\nHana: Huh?\r\nMirja: ...We're forbidden from meeting with her. The three of them know they can't see her... but I suppose they couldn't wait here.\r\nHana: But, then... Mihono...\r\nMirja: We can't leave here unattended, so the two of us remained behind...\r\nYui: ...To be honest, we don't know what to do. I went along with Kiyoka-chan and them at first, but they wouldn't listen to anything we said.\r\nHana: ......!\r\nHana: Let's see Mihono.\r\nYui: If they'd let anybody in, we would... but...\r\nHana: The investigation team can do it. The team's attached to the Origami family now, isn't it?\r\nYui: Ah!\r\nMirja: ......\r\nMirja: I had considered that possibility myself, but...\r\nHana: It might be mixing up private and official matters pretty badly... but that's not what matters most right now.\r\nHana: Let's go and see Mihono!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Visit (1)\r\n\r\nMirja: Thank you very much for hearing out our unreasonable request, Origami Yukari-sama.\r\nYukari: I was concerned for Asakura as well.\r\nYukari: Though... This is likely the first and last meeting we'll get. I can't keep making this happen.\r\nChie: I understand.\r\nYukari: ...Let's go.\r\n\r\nKanami: Huh? The investigation team's here?\r\nKofuki: What're you two doing here?\r\nHiyori: ...It's our assignment.\r\nYukari: We had the two of them stationed here. There aren't many toji who would be able to respond to Asakura when she loses control.\r\nKiyoka: Then, you two get to see Hono-chan...\r\nKanami: ...No, we don't get to visit her either.\r\nHiyori: The only time we'd get to see her... is when we have to stop her from rampaging.\r\nKiyoka: But then... does that mean, you're only here for if you have to cut down Hono-chan...?\r\nHiyori: ...... So, why are you...\r\nHiyori: ...Oh, you came to see Mihono.\r\nKanami: Good...\r\nKanami: Ever since Mihono-chan got locked up here, she probably hasn't gotten to see anybody...\r\nHana: Is there anything... you want us to tell Mihono for you?\r\nKanami: ...Just tell her, I'm sorry.\r\nHana: Eh?\r\nKanami: Sorry, that I couldn't do anything for her...\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nChie: We all... feel the same way... None of us could do anything...\r\nYui: Chie-san...\r\nHana: I'll make sure... she knows.\r\nHiyori: ...Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Visit (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Ah... Chii-nee... Guys...\r\nKofuki: Dang, Mihocchi. Haven't you been doing enough crying lately?\r\nMihono: But... they said... I'd never get to see anybody again...\r\nChie: I know... I know...!\r\nYui: This is too horrible! She's going to get all messed up, locked up in here by herself!\r\nMirja: Is there any hope of improving her conditions, Origami Yukari-sama?\r\nYukari: I could arrange for a better environment... but anything more would be difficult.\r\nYukari: ...Asakura. What have they told you, in regards to your treatment?\r\nMihono: They said, I can't ever leave here again... that it was for the good of the world...\r\nYui: Huh!? Losing Mihono-chan is way worse for the world!\r\nKiyoka: If we could do something about Kanayamahime... then, could Hono-chan leave here?\r\nYukari: If the great aradama within Asakura could be suppressed or fully sealed... it could happen.\r\nMirja: But... with what we have now, that would be effectively impossible...\r\nTsugumi: ...Then there's nothing else we can do. I'm going to pay a visit to Hitakami-san.\r\nChie: Tsugumi-chan!?\r\nTsugumi: Hitakami-san is currently the one with the most information on Kanayamahime.\r\nKofuki: Yeah... maybe that's a good idea.\r\nKiyoka: Kofuki-san! We don't need help from the kind of people who'd do those experiments! Let's save Hono-chan ourselves!\r\nKofuki: The whole reason this happened is cause we can't do that!\r\nKiyoka: That doesn't mean...\r\nMihono: Don't fight!\r\nKiyoka/Kofuki: ...\r\nMihono: I don't want to have to see you guys fighting...\r\nMihono: I'm fine, with staying here like this, so...\r\nChie: Mihono-chan...? What are you saying...?\r\nMihono: This whole time... I've been thinking by myself. Why all this had to happen.\r\nMihono: ...But, instead of being swallowed up by Kanayamahime, it'd be better if I just stayed locked up here...\r\nHana: ...I can't stand seeing you that weak, Mihono.\r\nMihono: Hana?\r\nHana: ...It's been a while.\r\nHana: I'm sorry... for not being there when you were going through so much.\r\nMihono: It's fine... I'm just glad you came to see me. I really am...\r\nYui: Hana-san's the one who came up with this, Mihono-chan. How, if we asked Yukari-sama, we could get special permission to see you.\r\nHana: We just used how the investigation team is working for the Origami family. We did have to bend the rules for it.\r\nHana: But, it was the right thing to do.\r\nHana: ...Don't try to sacrifice yourself, Mihono. Nobody wants you to do that.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nHana: You always looked best when you're saving somebody else... Whenever you're holding up your okatana as a toji.\r\nHana: Way better than wallowing in self-sacrifice in this place.\r\nHana: So... don't give up here. If the investigation team didn't have you... I couldn't take it.\r\nMihono: Hana...\r\nHana: All of us are wanting you to come back. Nobody thinks it'd be better if you stayed here, okay?\r\nHanae: That goes for Kanami-san and Hiyori-san too.\r\nMihono: Kanami and Juujou-san?\r\nYui: They're both right outside.\r\nYui: And, they're really depressed they couldn't do anything for you.\r\nYui: I'm sure everybody else feels the same way!\r\nMihono: ......\r\nChie: So please, don't give up now... We want to have more time with you...\r\nMihono: I mean... I want that too...\r\nMihono: Is it okay... if I still keep hoping for that...? Can I still... keep wanting to be with you...?\r\nChie: You shouldn't have to ask...\r\nMihono: Chii-nee... I want to get out of here... Help me...\r\nChie: I know... I will...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: I Want to Be With My Friends (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: ......Sigh, they're all gone again.\r\nMihono: But... Yeah. I'm feeling better. I mean, I never got to talk to anybody ever since they put me in here.\r\nMihono: ............\r\nMihono: UWAAAAHH------!\r\nMihono: I was hugging Chii-nee and crying right in front of everybody!? Now I'm all embarrassed thinking back on it--!\r\nMihono: ...Aha, what am I even doing anymore.\r\nMihono: I guess I felt like there was nothing I could do... but... I'm fine now.\r\nMihono: They all haven't given up yet. So, I'm... definitely not giving up either!\r\n\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMihono: ............\r\n\r\nMihono: Kanayamahime...\r\nMihono: Do you want to tell me something?\r\nMihono: ............\r\nMihono: ...I'm not going to give up.\r\nMihono: I thought, so long as I stayed in here... that might be what's best...\r\nMihono: But, everybody said they want me with them.\r\nMihono: So, I'm going to get out of here no matter what... I'm going to get back to them.\r\nMihono: Back to the investigation team... Back to Chii-nee, and Kiyoka, Fukki, Mirja-san, Yui, Tsugumi-san, Hana... Kanami and everybody...\r\nMihono: Cause I still want to be a toji!\r\nMihono: So I'll do it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: I Want to Be With My Friends (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: ...Eh?\r\nMihono: Oh no-- they got attacked...! ...Wait?\r\nMihono: Why do I... have Kashuu Kiyomitsu...?\r\nMihono: Did...\r\nMihono: I... attack them?\r\nMihono: N-No...\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan!! ...!? That's...\r\nMihono: Kanami... It's not like that, it's not...\r\nHiyori: Did you...\r\nMihono: No, I wasn't; I didn't mean to...\r\nKanami: We get it! We get it, okay, so... Calm down, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: ...I didn't want, this... I still wanted, to be with everybody...\r\nHiyori: MIHONO!!\r\nMihono: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Destroy Kanayamahime\r\n\r\nIn the dead of night--\r\n\r\nAkira: ......\r\nYuuki: ...Why do you think she called us for this late?\r\nAkira: ...You'll know when Makocchan gets here. Anyway, how're you feeling now?\r\nAkira: Your cold doing better?\r\nYuuki: Yep, I feel fine now. If anything, I feel like I'd get weaker if I rested any more.\r\nAkira: Alright.\r\nAkira: ...If it ever feels like too much for you, let me know. It's gonna be a rough night.\r\nYuuki: ...Akira-nee-sama? Do you know what's going on?\r\nMakoto: ......\r\nMakoto: Inago, Toribane.\r\nAkira/Yuuki: Yes.\r\nMakoto: It seems that Kanayamahime has awakened.\r\nAkira: ......Yeah.\r\nYuuki: Why are you so calm about that!?\r\nYuuki: What are you talking about, Nee-sama!? What about Mihono-san...\r\nMakoto: Kanayamahime cut down the toji guarding her and is currently missing.\r\nAkira: ...!\r\nMakoto: Strike down and exorcise Kanayamahime at once. This is what tamayori toji are for.\r\nYuuki: ......\r\nMakoto: You'll take care of it, won't you?\r\nAkira: I will.\r\nYuuki: ......I will.\r\nYuuki: I really wish it didn't come to this... but, if you order it, Makoto-nee-sama, then that's all there is to it.\r\nYuuki: I'll strike down Kanayamahime.\r\nAkira: Makocchan.\r\nMakoto: Yes?\r\nAkira: About Yuuki...\r\nMakoto: What about Toribane?\r\nAkira: ......Nah, it's nothing. Let's go.\r\nYuuki: Right!\r\nMakoto: ............\r\nMakoto: ...Is there anyone there?\r\nHitakami Toji: What do you need?\r\nMakoto: Please make this announcement to all toji.\r\nMakoto: We, the Hitakami faction, will destroy Kanayamahime! Allow Inago and Toribane to reach Kanayamahime by all means!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Suppression Order (1)\r\n\r\nAt that time--\r\n\r\nMaki: Everyone's here, Yukari-sama.\r\nYukari: ...Kanayamahime has awakened. Her current whereabouts are unknown.\r\nEveryone: !?\r\nChie: That can't be... Why...?\r\nKiyoka: No... She said she wouldn't give up..\r\nYui: Mihono-chan...\r\nKofuki: ...!!\r\nKofuki: Hey! What the hell did you do to Mihocchi!? This came out of nowhere... This is bullshit!\r\nMirja: ...Get a hold of yourself, Shichinosato Kofuki. Origami Yukari-sama, could we have an explanation?\r\nYukari: If you want to know the specifics, you should hear it from them. ...Etou, Juujou.\r\nKanami: ...Okay.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan and I were waiting on alert at the Ministry of Defense, in case Mihono-chan lost control...\r\nKofuki: Who gives a shit about that!?\r\nKofuki: Tell us what happened!\r\nKanami: ......\r\nHiyori: ......Mihono attacked someone.\r\nKofuki: .........Huh? You think this is a joke or what?\r\nKofuki: Oi, give me a real answer, Kanami!\r\nKanami: ......\r\nKofuki: Say something!\r\nHiyori: It's the truth! \r\nHiyori: When Kanami and I heard Mihono went berserk, we went to see her.\r\nHiyori: And when we got there... we saw toji on the floor and Mihono standing over them.\r\nTsugumi: ...Did Asakura-san really do it? Or did it just look that way?\r\nHiyori: ...Who could have made it look like that?\r\nTsugumi: ......That's fair.\r\nHana: ...\r\nMirja: ...What condition are the toji she attacked in?\r\nMaki: It seems like it only went as far as them losing utsushi. Thankfully, it wasn't life threatening.\r\nMai: At that point... was it already Kanayamahime?\r\nHiyori: No...\r\nHiyori: It was Mihono.\r\nKanami: There's no way Mihono-chan could have wanted to hurt anyone though...\r\nKanami: She was really panicked and afraid...\r\nKanami: Seeing her like that...\r\nMai: ...\r\nMai: So Mihono-chan attacked them with her okatana?\u3000\r\nKofuki: Hey! She just said Mihocchi didn't want to hurt anybody!!\r\nSayaka: Stop, Kofuki.\r\nKofuki: Why should I!? They're the ones treating Mihocchi like she tried to kill somebody!\r\nMai: It doesn't make sense...\r\nSayaka: Mai? What do you mean...?\r\nMai: Why would Mihono-chan have her okatana?\r\nChie: ...Eh?\r\nMirja: ...True, you're absolutely right.\r\nMirja: After being placed in confinement, Asakura Mihono should not have had Kashuu Kiyomitsu with her. Isn't that right?\r\nMai: Yes.\r\nSuzuka: Kashuu Kiyomitsu was confiscated while Asakura-san was confined. It's currently in secure custody... or should have been. It seems that someone brought it out.\r\nEllen: ...On top of that, there's one other thing that caught my attention.\r\nEllen: Kanamin and Hiyoyon, you two were stationed at the Ministry of Defense in case Mihomiho went berserk, right?\r\nEllen: So then, why did some other toji go up against Mihomiho before you two?\r\nKaoru:\u3000...This whole thing's fishy.\r\nKaoru: I don't who, but somebody's going around pulling the strings here.\r\nMihono: Mai... did somebody frame Mihono?\r\nMai: ...I think that's probably it.\r\nMai: In order to make Kanayamahime awaken...\r\nYukari: The Hitakami faction is already taking action. If you want to save Asakura... you'll have to reach her before the Hitakami faction does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Suppression Order (2)\r\n\r\nMaki: Once you've decided on your plan, let us know. We'll follow along with it.\r\nMirja: The Special Defense Team will be assisting us?\r\nMaki: It's on Akane-sama's order.\r\nHiyori: With all these top toji, we can settle this quick. I'll use my Hitotsu no Tachi.\r\nKanami: You can't do that, Hiyori-chan!\r\nKanami: Even if it brings Mihono-chan back, there's no point if you're gone!\r\nHiyori: Still, we don't have any other options.\r\nMirja: No, Etou Kanami is correct here.\r\nMirja: If you were to use Hitotsu no Tachi to suppress Kanayamahime, there's the potential for it to repeat the effects of the Kamakura Special Hazardous Waste Leakage Issue.\r\nMirja: In the current state of things, with the rampant frequency of aradama appearances, using Hitotsu no Tachi poses too much of a risk.\r\nFriedman: Thinking about that won't do us much good now though.\r\nEllen: Grandpa!\r\nKaoru: What's the old man doing here?\r\nFriedman: I thought I might be some help.\r\nFriedman: Whether or not this could repeat the effects of the Special Hazardous Waste Leakage Issue, there's too little information on just what kind of aradama Kanayamahime is.\r\nFriedman: We could just as easily assume it would do the same thing as with Tagitsuhime, or that it wouldn't.\r\nKaoru: So we're in the dark.\r\nFriedman: ...You all have the choice of three paths to commit to. The first: consider Mihono-kun as Kanayamahime and suppress her.\r\nKiyoka: We're not going to do that!\r\nFriedman: I know. The second: Hiyori-kun will use Hitotsu no Tachi, saving Mihono-kun.\r\nKanami: We're not doing that either.\r\nFriedman: Then, the third option: Mihono-kun is saved, without sacrificing Hiyori-kun.\r\nChie: There's a way to make that happen...?\r\nFriedman: ...I'm sorry to say, we haven't found a means to doing that.\r\nFriedman: Still, there isn't very much time to mull it over. The tamayori toji are already making their move.\r\nMirja: ...We'll move out as well.\r\nMirja: If we can't find Asakura Mihono before the Hitakami Faction does, she won't survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: An Unfortunate Run-In\r\n\r\nChie: Mihono-chan... Where'd you...\r\nKiyoka: Even though we tried looking places Hono-chan might've gone, she isn't anywhere...\r\nMirja: Right now, the one moving Asakura Mihono's body is Kanayamahime.\r\nMirja: If she were there, it would be a stroke of luck...\r\nKaoru: So we're out of leads...\r\nTsugumi: Fighting has broken out between Asakura-san and other toji.\r\nChie: --!\r\nMai: Was anyone hurt...?\r\nTsugumi: There's no need to worry. While some toji were injured, none of the injuries are severe.\r\nChie: Thank goodness...\r\nTsugumi: Currently, they're in pursuit while maintaining a distance. I'll send you the relevant data.\r\nKanami: Let's go, everybody!\r\n\r\nHiyori: --! Hold on!\r\nKaoru: What's wrong, Hiyori?\r\nKanami: ...Someone's coming!\r\nAkira: Whoa there!\r\nEllen: Akira!\r\nAkira: The hell; the whole gang's here.\r\nAkira: Normally, this could be a good brawl, but... Sorry. We don't got time to deal with you now.\r\nAkira: ...Out of the way.\r\nKofuki: Fuck you! How about you get lost!\r\nYuuki: ...There's some rowdy people in our way.\r\nYuuki: Though... it's lucky we ran into you here! I'll make up for what happened last time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: Yume and Yuuki (1)\r\n\r\nYuuki: TSUBAKURO YUMEEEEEEEEEE!\r\nYume: Whoopsie.\r\nYume: Umm... Who were you again?\r\nYuuki: Don't make light of me!\r\nMaki: That's Toribane Yuuki, Yume.\r\nYume: Ahh, from that one time! I couldn't tell cause you're wearing that stuff.\r\nYume: But, you're still just as weak, huh.\r\nYuuki: Screw you!\r\nYume: This's that tamayori thing? Even with that on, is that all you can do?\r\nAkira: You sure talk a big game! Then, how about you take me on too!\r\nYume: Ahaha! You're ganging up on me?\r\nYuuki: Nee-sama! I'll defeat Tsubakuro Yume myself!\r\nAkira: I'm not letting you have all the fun! Let me join in on this!!\r\nYuuki: ...It's first come, first serve!\r\nYume: That's more like it! It's finally getting fun!\r\n\r\nSuzuka: What a hotheaded bunch. Though, this works in our favor.\r\nMaki: Right. ...The rest of you go on ahead. We'll take care of things here.\r\nMirja: With this many of them...\r\nMirja: Will that really be fine?\r\nMaki: It'll take more than that to make a difference to us... Get going!\r\nSuzuka: More than this? Were you trying to show off?\r\nMaki: Still, we can handle this, can't we?\r\nSuzuka: I suppose. ...Oh?\r\nYomi: ...Reinforcements.\r\nMaki: (I wanted to go back up Yume, but... That's not happening with this many of them.)\r\nMaki: (No, even against two tamayori toji, Yume'll definitely win.)\r\nMaki: (So there's only one thing we have to do!)\r\nMaki: That's still not going to be enough against us.\r\nMaki: If you're looking to bring down the Special Defense Team, you should have brought twice that!\r\nMaki: HAAAAAAAAAAAH!!\r\n\r\nAkira: ORAAAAAAA!\r\nYume: Whoa!\r\nYuuki: Stop only fighting Akira-nee-sama! I want to smack you down too!\r\nYume: --!!\r\nYume: (Fighting both of them is actually pretty tough, but...)\r\nYume: Ahaha!\r\nYume: This is finally getting exciting. Hey... you can go harder than that, can't you?\r\nAkira: --!?\r\nYume: Well?\r\nAkira: Course we can!! Yuuki!!\r\nYuuki: Yes!\r\nYuuki: I'll make sure... you'll never forget the name Yuuki!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: Yume and Yuuki (2)\r\n\r\nYume: Ungh...!?\r\nYuuki: Is that it, Tsubakuro Yume!? Is that the best you've got!? HAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nYume: (She's going to hit head on...! I have to use kongoushin...!)\r\nYume: ......\r\nYume: ...Huh?\r\nYuuki: [pant gasp]...\r\nAkira: Yuuki!?\r\nYume: What're you falling over for!? You're ruining all the fun!\r\nAkira: (The side effects of tamayori are kicking in!? What do I do!? Bring Yuuki back home? Or do I just...) \r\nHitakami Toji: Etou Kanami and the others have made contact with Kanayamahime!\r\nAkira: Shit! Why'd this have to happen now!\r\nAkira: (Tsubakuro Yume's exhausted from the fighting. I should be able to get away on my own...)\r\nAkira: ...The mission comes first! I'm leaving Yuuki to you!\r\nHitakami Toji: Roger!\r\nYume: You think I'm letting you go, Onee-san?\r\nYume: You can still keep on going, can't you?\r\nAkira: ...Sorry, but the situation's changed.\r\nAkira: Oi!\r\nHitakami Toji: Right! Please go, Akira-san!\r\nYume: Don't get in our way!\r\nYume: Wait, she's already gone!\r\nHitakami Toji: I won't let you stop us!\r\nYume: ...Hmm. Fine then, I'll play with you.\r\nYume: But, I'm kinda mad right now, so don't blame me if I mess you up.\r\n\r\nMaki: HAH!\r\nMaki: That's the last of them...\r\nMaki: Yume, how's things for you?\r\nYume: I already finished up!\r\nYume: Sigh, they weren't strong, just a lot of them. I'm tired.\r\nSuzuka: I'm sure none of us have much energy left...\r\nYuuki: ......\r\nSuzuka: For now, we'll have to settle with securing her.\r\nYuuki: ......\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYomi: (Akira...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: The Ongoing Battle\r\n\r\nYume: Hey, this girl looks like she's really hurting.\r\nYuuki: ...\r\nSuzuka: I'll make arrangements to get her to a hospital at once. Yume, can I ask you to accompany her there?\r\nYume: If I have to.\r\nMaki: ...Aren't you going to go after her, Yomi?\r\nYomi: I wouldn't... be able to stop her.\r\nMaki: You sure?\r\nYomi: Akira is stubborn.\r\nYomi: ...That's never changed.\r\nMaki: Oh.\r\nMaki: ...!\r\nMaki: Doesn't seem like we'll get a breather yet anyway.\r\nMaki: Suzuka, Yomi, Yume. Can you still fight?\r\nSuzuka: It's looking to be a long night, isn't it.\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nYume: It doesn't matter how many of these losers they throw at us.\r\nMaki: ...That's good to hear.\r\nMaki: We're holding this bridge whatever it takes!

You're talking all formal again!\r\nMillie: We're all on the same team, so didn't we say you don't have to be so polite?\r\nRena: Ah...\r\nRena: I get that, I just can't help it.\r\nReimi: It's not worth making that big a deal of either, Millie.\r\nReimi: Anyway, let's get back to everybody. We'll have to think up a plan for dealing with aradama.\r\nRena: We need some kind of strategy, don't we.\r\nMillie: A strategy? The fastest way would be getting some toji to help us.\r\nReimi: That's true. To carry out what we're after, we're definitely going to need a toji's help at some point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/ozt89k\r\n-1: Sci-Fi Technology\r\n\r\nMaria Traydor: Reimi got in touch. Like we expected, it doesn't seem they were able to defeat an aradama.\r\nMiki Sauvester: Well shoot, so they really couldn't beat it? Hmmm, so that means, we're in trouble here... aren't we.\r\nMaria: We are. It's impossible for us to resolve this on our own. But, we aren't entirely without options.\r\nMiki: You mean, how you said we could borrow help from a toji?\r\nMaria: That's right, from toji.\r\nWelch Vinyard: Fidget, fidget...\r\nMiki: W-Welch...?\r\nWelch: Aghhh, I want to hurry and work our way in with the toji so I can see storm armor up close and personallll!!\r\nWelch: That stuff has to be that crazy sci-fi technology kinda thing, right!?\r\nWelch: As an item creator, there's no way I can pass it up!\r\nWelch: You think they'd notice if we swiped just one of 'em~? Just whisk it away and start taking it apartttt...!!\r\nMaria: ...Sigh.\r\nMaria: Forget about that and take a look at this.\r\nMiki: It's... a picture of a girl?\r\nMaria: The toji, Ban Tsugumi.\r\nMaria: And this next. The contents of Ban Tsugumi's current research.\r\nWelch: Hmhmm~, I see, I see. So basically, we make contact and get in good with her, yes?\r\nMaria: That's the plan.\r\nMiki: That's fine and all, but... Maria-san? Where'd you get all this info?\r\nMaria: That's not something you should worry about.\r\nMiki: Ehh!? That just makes me worried!!\r\nMaria: Now's not the time to be talking about this, is it?\r\nWelch: Maria's got the right idea! Okayyy, we meet up with Reimi and them, then it's off to meet Ban Tsugumi!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1: Tsugumi's Assistants\r\n\r\nYukari: I see you're here, Asakura, Yanase.\r\nMihono/Mihono: Yes ma'am!\r\nYukari: Ordinarily, Akane would be the one to tell you this, but she can't make time. I'll be the one reporting to you instead.\r\nYukari: I'd like for the two of you to help at Ban's laboratory.\r\nMai: At... Tsugumi-san's laboratory?\r\nMihono: Ah, I know about this! It's that thing she's been stuck up in her lab working on lately, right?\r\nMihono: I think she said... it's some kinda crazy research that could revolutionize a bunch of things like storm armor and stuff?\r\nYukari: I've heard the same.\r\nYukari: However, at the current stage, we can't spare her too many people, so for now I'd like you two to go.\r\nMihono/Mai: Yes ma'am!\r\n\r\nMihono: So the stuff she's working on is actually pretty crazy! I couldn't believe it.\r\nMai: Didn't you hear about it before, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Yeah, but, I mean, it's Tsugumi-san, y'know? I never really know how much to trust her...\r\nMihono: Like, sometimes, you can't tell whether she's being serious or lying about something, right?\r\nMai: You're right, she can be like that sometimes.\r\nMihono: But it looks like she was telling the truth here, so let's work real hard to help her out, Mai!\r\nMai: Sure thing, Mihono-chan.\r\n\r\n???: Hah hah hah! I'm glad you're here, assistants! We've been waiting for you!\r\nMihono: Who's that!?\r\nMai: A friend of... Tsugumi-san's?\r\n???: Of course they'd react like that...\r\nMiki Sauvester: I'm Miki Sauvester. I'm helping out Tsugumi.\r\nMiki: And, this is...\r\nWelch Vinyard: Likewise, helping out Tsugumi, the beautiful genius creator, Welch-chan at your service! Looking forward to working with you, assistants!\r\nMai: You're helping her...? I don't mean to pry, but, you aren't from the Sword Administration, are you? Could you tell us where you're associated with?\r\nWelch: What's any of that got to do with anything!\r\nWelch: More importantly, you two have an impossibly important job getting the necessary items for Tsugumi's research!\r\nWelch: So anyway, go on, get going and get them back!!\r\n\r\nMihono: We got shooed out... That person seemed really worked up about this...\r\nMai: That's for sure... And, she didn't even tell us what it is we're supposed to get...\r\nMihono: Ah.\r\nMiki: Oh, there you are!\r\nMai: Miki-san?\r\nMiki: Sorry about that, how she kicked you out and all. Welch isn't such a bad girl, it's just...\r\nMiki: Uh, could I ask for your names?\r\nMihono: I'm Asakura Mihono.\r\nMai: And I'm Yanase Mai.\r\nMiki: Mihono and Mai then. I'll be helping you two out, so, I hope we can get along!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Ears and a Tail\r\n\r\nMai: Where are we heading?\r\nMiki: There's others besides Welch and me who are working with Tsugumi, so we're going to see them.\r\nMihono: Huh, what're they like?\r\nMiki: Well...\r\n???: Ah, Rena! Miki's here!\r\n???: There she is! Heeey, Miki!\r\nMiki: Millie! Rena-!\r\nMiki: I'll introduce everybody; that's Millie and Rena. And, these two are Asakura Mihono and Yanase Mai.\r\nMihono/Mai: ......\r\nMillie Chliette: Hey, Miki? They look frozen stiff...\r\nRena Lanford: I think... they're looking at my ears and Millie's tail?\r\nMihono: Mai! Millie-san's got a tail!? And, Rena-san's ears, they're all long and pointy!?\r\nMai: I-I know... That's not part of a costume, is it...?\r\nMillie: They're all real! Want to give it a touch?\r\nMihono: Eh!? Can I!?\r\nMillie: Sure!\r\nMihono: It's so fluffy...\r\nRena: Uhh... You want to touch mine too, Mai?\r\nMai: Ah, then... just a little bit.\r\nMai: (Oh, they twitched... These ears really are real...)\r\nMai: H-Hey, Mai...? People don't grow tails, right... Or those ears...\r\nMai: R-Right...\r\nMiki: Millie, Rena, about that thing...\r\nRena: Ah... Yeah. It's over here.\r\n\r\nAradama: Gyou~\r\nRena: Ahaha, that tickles.\r\nMihono: That aradama's acting friendly with Rena-san!?\r\nMillie: When we first found this aradama, it was really weakened.\r\nMillie: Rena and I felt sorry for it, so we worked together to heal it... And then, it kinda got attached to us.\r\nMihono: Normally, we should probably kill it, but... Mai... I don't think I want to kill this aradama.\r\nMai: ...I know. There's cases like Nene-chan, so, as long as it's not harming anyone, I don't think there's any need to suppress it...\r\nAradama: GyaA!!\r\nMai: --!! Did it turn aggressive!?\r\nMihono: No, wait, Mai... Behind you!!\r\nLarge Aradama: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nRena: Watch out, Mai! Kyah...\r\nMai: Thank you, Rena-san! But, you're hurt...\r\nMiki: Just let me take care of her injury! Healing!\r\nMillie: I'll back you up, so Mihono, Mai, take care of the aradama!! Delay!!\r\nMihono: The aradama slowed down... We can take it out while it's like this, Mai!!\r\nMai: Right, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono/Mai: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nLarge Aradama: ooo...\r\nMihono: Thanks for letting us know that aradama was there.\r\nAradama: Kyuo~\r\nMai: Now we should contact the Sword Administration Bureau and collect the noro... Hm? What's this here?\r\nMiki: Ah-! That's it! That's the geregere slime we need for Tsugumi's research!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Welch's Identity\r\n\r\nWelch: That's some geregere slime alright! Nice going getting some so quick, assistants!\r\nMai: Geregere slime... I've never seen or heard of that kind of material before...\r\nWelch: Course not! Of course not! After all, it's a totally unknown material!\r\nMihono: If it's unknown, then how'd you know it's called geregere slime?\r\nWelch: Shaddup! Even though we know what it's called, it's an unknown material, and it's absolutely needed for Tsugumi's experiment!!\r\nMihono: Oh, okay!\r\nMai: ...Don't let her fool you, Mihono-chan.\r\nMai: Welch-san, are you really Tsugumi-san's assistant? We haven't seen Tsugumi around even once...\r\nWelch: ...Seems like the cat's out of the bag now.\r\nMihono: Welch-san?\r\nMai: ...\r\nWelch: That's right, I'm not Tsugumi's assistant or anything...\r\nWelch: My true identity is, the one who hijacked this lab, the beautiful genius creator Welch-chan!! Hah hah hah!\r\nTsugumi: You look like you're enjoying yourself, Vinyard-san.\r\nMiki: What are you up to, Welch?\r\nWelch: Wait, you're back already?\r\nMiki: \"Already\"? Weren't you the one who told me to call Tsugumi-san over?\r\nTsugumi: Thank you for watching the lab while I was gone, Vinyard-san. I got to have a nice break.\r\nWelch: I could do this anytime!\r\nWelch: Everything you're working on here's super interesting, so you have to make sure to take breaks so you can get on with the research!\r\nMihono: So wait, you were just messing with us?\r\nMihono: Tsugumi-san and Welch-san have the same kind of energy... Or, they seem like they really get along, don't they, Mai.\r\nMai: ...Mmhm. It looks like I was worried for nothing.\r\nMai: Miki-san, there's still more geregere slime, isn't there? Let's go get it.\r\nMiki: Sure! Then, we're off again, Welch, Tsugumi!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Now then, back to my research-.\r\nWelch: Sure-!\r\nTsugumi: By the way, what exactly is geregere slime?\r\nWelch: Rather than talk about that, tell me more about noro!\r\nTsugumi: It doesn't seem like you're about to tell me, are you. Oh well; what about noro would you like to know?\r\nTsugumi: (...Well, I suppose I can press her about geregere slime later.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Guns and Arrows\r\n\r\nMihono: Rena-san and Millie-san turned out to be nice people! \r\nMai: Mmhm, though I was a little surprised by their tail and ears...\r\nMihono: So Miki-san, do the people you're taking us to meet have tails too?\r\nMiki: Nope, the two we're going to see now don't have any tails. But, they're wonderful people, so I'm sure...\r\nMai: Miki-san?\r\nMiki: U-Urgh...\r\nMihono: What's wrong!?\r\nMiki: I'm hungry...\r\nMai: Eh? You're hungry...?\r\nMiki: Come to think of it, I haven't gotten much to eat lately...\r\nMihono: D-Don't scare me like that... I thought something bad happened to you.\r\nMiki: Sorry about that... But... I think I might be too hungry to keep going...\r\nMihono: Then, I'll go and buy something for you. You stay with Miki-san, Mai.\r\nMai: Alright!\r\n\r\nMihono: I've got onigiri, and tea, and... Okay, this should be enough.\r\nMihono: Better run back over to Mai and Miki-san!\r\nMihono: Aradama!?\r\n\r\nMihono: I can handle this many on my own!\r\nMihono: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: There's still more!?\r\n???: We'll back you up.\r\nMihono: Huh?\r\nMihono: Was that a beam she shot!?\r\n???: YAH!\r\nMihono: She stopped the aradama with arrows!?\r\n???: Don't just stand there; finish them off!\r\nMihono: O-Okay! YAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\n???: Keep it up like that.\r\n???: We'll slow the aradama down, so you can use that to take them out!\r\nMihono: I-I don't really know who you are, but... I got it!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Secrecy\r\n\r\nAradama: ooo...\r\nMihono: That's the last of them... I think. Thanks a lot for helping me!\r\n???: We only did what was natural.\r\n???: I'm glad you're safe.\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: Uh, there's something I want to ask...\r\nMai: Mihono-chan! Where are the aradama!?\r\nMihono: Ah, Mai!\r\nMihono: I already took care of them. I had these people helping me...\r\nMiki: Maria-san, Reimi-san?\r\nMaria: Miki... Then, that would mean, these girls are...\r\nMiki: Yep, that's right. That girl is Asakura Mihono, and this one's Yanase Mai.\r\nMaria: I'm Maria Traydor.\r\nReimi: And I'm Reimi Saionji.\r\nMihono: Maria-san and Reimi-san...\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: Um, who are you people, Miki-san?\r\nMiki: Eh?\r\nMihono: Maria-san had a gun that shot beams, and I've never seen somebody fight aradama with a bow like Reimi-san...\r\nMihono: Hey, Mai, there's no kind of archery that fights aradama, is there?\r\nMai: ...There's not. If there were archery like that, it would be very well known.\r\nMiki/Maria/Reimi: ......\r\nMaria: It seems like it'd be faster to explain our circumstances.\r\nReimi: Hang on, Maria! We don't have to tell people from this world about ourselves!\r\nMaria: We can't get by without Mihono and Mai's... without the help of toji.\r\nMaria: We won't be able to move forward with them harboring suspicions towards us.\r\nReimi: Still...\r\nMiki: I get what you mean, Reimi-san, but I think I'm with Maria-san here.\r\nMiki: We haven't spent much time together, but I can tell we can trust Mihono and Mai.\r\nReimi: Miki...\r\nReimi: Alright. I understand. These two are going to be fighting alongside us, after all. We shouldn't be hiding anything from each other.\r\nReimi: But, if that's what we've decided on, we should move somewhere quieter to explain ourselves.\r\nMaria: Right. I'll call Millie and Rena here too.\r\nMai: Explain yourselves? So you really were hiding something...\r\nMiki: So you were doubting us after all...?\r\nMihono: It's not like I was doubting you... Just, I did think it was weird.\r\nMaria: Have no fear. The secret we've been keeping shouldn't be anything like you're expecting.\r\nMai: ...I'll decide on that on that after you tell us. \r\nReimi: Of course; that's fine too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: An Ocean of Stars\r\n\r\nMaria: Rena and Millie still aren't here, but we're wasting time, so I'll go ahead and start.\r\nMaria: I'll get straight to the point. None of us are from this world. We came here from a different one.\r\nMai: From a different world...?\r\nReimi: That's right, Mai-chan.\r\nReimi: Back from the future of another world... We came here to this world from the star ocean.\r\nMihono: Eh? Eh? Star ocean; is that like, space?\r\nMihono: And, you came from there to our world?\r\nMihono: My head feels like it's spinning...\r\nMai: ...Why is it that all of your clothes are so different from each other?\r\nMaria: The differences in the eras and places we're from.\r\nMaria: It seems like Miki and Welch knew each other before, but for the rest of us, it's our first time meeting.\r\nMai: So you're from different times and places... But, you're all working together with each other...\r\nMai: ......\r\nMai: Did you all come to our world for the same reason?\r\nMaria: Yes, that's the case.\r\nMaria: We came to this world to recover geregere slime, a biribiri plasma rod, and an energy stone. Those three materials.\r\nMaria: The three of them are things that ordinarily should not exist in your world.\r\nMai: And, when you said you're helping with Tsugumi-san's research... Was that just a way to gain access to those?\r\nMaria: That's right.\r\nMaria: If I could add one thing... Another of our goals is to stop Tsugumi's research.\r\nMihono: Eh? But, you can't do that! I mean, I don't really get what it's about, but she's researching something amazing, right!?\r\nReimi: ...That's why we have to.\r\nReimi: This world wouldn't have any way to substantiate Tsugumi's research.\r\nReimi: But... With those three materials, it suddenly becomes possible.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMai: Why was it that aradama absorbed those materials?\r\nMaria: They have a high affinity with noro. To tell the truth, we had wanted to recover them all without making contact with anyone from this world.\r\nMai: I get it... But because of that, you needed toji to help you.\r\nMai: ......\r\nMai: When Welch-san stayed behind in the lab, was that just so she could get in the way of Tsugumi-san's research...?\r\nMaria: ......This is for the sake of your world.\r\nMihono: But, Tsugumi-san's working so hard...... I kind of don't like that you're doing that.\r\nReimi: Maria, if you leave it at that, they're going to misunderstand.\r\nMihono: Huh?\r\nWelch: Hey, it's not like I have any intention of getting in Tsugumi's way?\r\nMiki: Welch's gotten way too interested in this world... That's why Maria-san said, so she couldn't make trouble, Welch isn't allowed out of the lab.\r\nWelch: Hey--! It's not like that either!!\r\nWelch: Tsubumi's laboratory is just full of so much neat stuff that I haven't felt any reason to leave! The whole world is packed up in here~!\r\nMihono: H-Haha... So that's all. Somehow, hearing that's a relief.\r\nMai: ...I understand most of what you're going through now.\r\nMaria: We'd like for you to help us, Mai, Mihono.\r\nMaria: We need your toji powers to keep this world protected.\r\nMihono: ...Okay, I'll help you. What about you, Mai?\r\nMai: I'll... help too.\r\nMiki: Thank goodness... If we didn't get you on our side, things would get really messed up.\r\nMihono: Messed up?\r\nMaria: If Tsugumi were to complete her research... It could potentially destroy your world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Threat to the World\r\n\r\nMaria: If Tsugumi were to complete her research... It could potentially destroy your world.\r\nMihono: It's that dangerous!? Then, let's tell Tsugumi-san right away to stop the experiments!!\r\nMaria: ...We don't want to do that. Tsugumi is a researcher, after all.\r\nMihono: She's a researcher... Wait, what do you mean?\r\nMaria: What Tsugumi is studying really is something incredible. A civilization mature enough to apply it properly might improve the lives of countless people.\r\nMaria: But... it's too soon for this world.\r\nMaria: Would she really be able to stop halfway through researching something that incredible? Could she curb her curiousity? There's a chance it could have the opposite effect and only make her obsess over it.\r\nMai: Still...\r\nReimi: We can't dispel the fear that it would only increase the risks. So, we decided that we shouldn't explain the situation to her.\r\nMihono: Mmm, but I think it'll go fine? If Tsugumi-san knew going on with her research could destroy the world, she'd stop it for sure!\r\nWelch: I'm with Mihono on this! Tsugumi's just like me! So we can trust her!\r\nMiki: Just like you. That just makes me even more worried...\r\nMihono: Maria-san! Reimi-san! Please give her a chance!!\r\nMiki: ...If Mihono's that sure about it, why don't we try talking to Tsugumi?\r\nMihono: If it's hard for you to tell her about it, I'll do it!\r\nMaria: That's not the issue here... But fine then.\r\nMaria: But if, on the other hand, Tsugumi tries to continue her research, we're going to keep her restrained until we finish collecting the three materials, understood?\r\nMihono: Understood! Then, I'll call up Tsugumi-san!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: I see, so that's what's been going on. Then, we'll have to put a stop to this research, won't we.\r\nMihono: See, it's fine!\r\nMaria: It seems so.\r\nMaria: Now that Millie and Rena have made it back, I'd like to once more set out searching for the materials, but... Mihono? Who are these two?\r\nMihono: That's Chii-nee and Yui! Since there's three things you had to look for, I thought it'd be better to have more help, so I brought them!\r\nMaria: It wouldn't hurt to have more hands available, but...\r\nYui: I get to go on a mission with these pretty ladies!? Score! Thanks, Mihono-chan!\r\nChie: Yui-chan. Mihono-chan told us the world was in danger, didn't she?\r\nYui: I remember!\r\nMaria: ...Will they really be up for this?\r\nMihono: Yeah! Chii-nee and Yui are both really reliable toji!\r\nMaria: ...Sigh. We'll explain the details on the way. ...Yui, you're coming with me. We're recovering the energy stone.\r\n\r\nMaria: You didn't need to come along with us, Reimi, Rena.\r\nReimi: I was a little worried after the harsh look you were giving Yui-chan.\r\nReimi: Do you... not trust her?\r\nMaria: I don't doubt Mihono's appraisal of her. Still... with how she was acting, I highly doubt she has a proper grasp on the situation.\r\nYui: Maria-san! What other places haven't you looked yet? Nothing's showing up on the spectrum finder, so we should check the next one.\r\nMaria: Yui, you're suddenly taking this a lot more seriously, aren't you?\r\nYui: Well, the world's in danger, right? Which means... I can't fool around too much. My sister's on the line here too.\r\nReimi: So you want to keep others safe. ...She is a good toji.\r\nMaria: ...It seems.\r\nYui: Thanks for the compliment! Even better coming someone as good looking as you!\r\nRena: Hey, Yui. That, spectrum finder you called it? Could I see it for a minute?\r\nYui: Ah, sure thing. Here you go, Rena-san.\r\nRena: Thanks.\r\nRena: Eh!? Ehh!? It started making noises all of a sudden!?\r\nRena: It stopped...? Did I... break it!? I'm sorry, Yui!!\r\nYui: No, that's not it!!\r\nAradama: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nMaria: Aradama!\r\nRena: We'll back you up! Yui, you finish off the aradama!!\r\nYui: Right!\r\n\r\nYui: TORYAAAAAAAH!!\r\nAradama: ooo...\r\nRena: Now if this aradama just had an energy stone...\r\nYui: There's noro, and... Is that it...?\r\nMaria: Yes, that's an energy stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Gluttons From the Stars\r\n\r\nChie: We're supposed to be looking for a biribiri plasma rod... but now Millie-san's gotten lost somewhere...\r\nMiki: Where'd you run off to, Millie... Heeey! Millie!\r\nChie: First, we should go back the way we came. She might be waiting for us somewhere.\r\n\r\nChie: She's not here either... I wonder when we got separated...\r\nMiki: ......\r\nChie: Miki-san?\r\nMiki: I know this...!!\r\nChie: W-Wait, Miki-san! Where are you going!?\r\n\r\nChie: (Miki-san must have found Millie-san!)\r\nMiki: Right here, Chie!!\r\nChie: This is... a roasted potatoes stand? \r\nMiki: This smell... It smells so good...\r\nChie: ...Miki-san? Weren't we meant to be looking for Millie-san?\r\nMiki: O-Of course we are! I just thought, Millie must have smelled this too and will come here!\r\nChie: You know that's not true. We can leave the potatoes for after; let's find Millie-san now.\r\nMillie: Something kinda smells really good!\r\nMillie: ...Ah, Miki! And Chie too!!\r\nMiki: Geez, where'd you disappear to? We were worried about you!\r\nChie: (We actually did find her... These two must have big stomachs...)\r\nMillie: Ah, now that I've found you, I'm so relieved I'm hungry...\r\nChie: I'm hungry too, now that we can settle down. I'll buy us some roasted potatoes, so how about we take a break?\r\nMiki: Can we!?\r\nChie: Sure; I'll be back in a minute.\r\n\r\nMillie/Miki: Thanks for the food-!\r\nAradama: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nMillie: Uwah!?\r\nMiki: Kya!?\r\nChie: Aradama!? Are you two alright!?\r\nMillie: We're fine, but our...\r\nMiki: Our potatoes...\r\nChie: Ah, you dropped them just then, didn't you.\r\nMillie: ...You're not getting away with that.\r\nMillie: Miki!\r\nMiki: Sure, Millie!\r\nMillie: Tractor Beam!\r\nAradama: GUOO!?\r\nMiki: Earth Grave!!\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!?\r\nChie: That's incredible... So that's the kind of power you have, Miki-san, Millie-san...\r\nMillie: Chie! Please finish it!\r\nMiki: As payback for our potatoes!\r\nChie: R-Right... HAAAAAAAH!!\r\nAradama: oooo...\r\nChie: With the noro, there's... so this is a biribiri plasma rod? Luckily we managed to get it.\r\nChie: Let's head on back, Miki-san, Millie-san.\r\nMillie: Our potatoes...\r\nChie: ...I guess there's no getting around that. I'll buy you both one more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: To the Star Ocean\r\n\r\nMaria: You have my thanks for helping us with these.\r\nMaria: The geregere slime Mihono and Mai collected. The energy stone Yui found. And the biribiri plasma rod Chie gathered.\r\nMaria: Now we have them all togethere.\r\nMihono: That means the world's not in danger anymore, right...?\r\nReimi: Yes, it's alright now.\r\nMai: Sigh, thank goodness...\r\nChie: Good work, everyone.\r\nYui: By the way, how are you all going to get back to your world, Maria-san?\r\nYui: If you can't make it back for some reason, you're welcome to stay in my room!\r\nMaria: We have this with us, so we'll be fine.\r\nYui: And what's that?\r\nMaria: A quad scanner. With this...\r\nChie: The slime, rod, and stone are glowing...\r\nTsugumi: Now that's a fascinating phenomenon.\r\nMaria: We can now return at any time.\r\nWelch: Wait; hold on!\r\nWelch: Since we can go back anytime, that means we don't have to go back just yet, right!?\r\nWelch: I haven't gotten my hands on the storm armor yettt~!!\r\nMiki: ...Maybe it'd be better if we left right away.\r\nMiki: Thanks, Mihono, Mai, Yui, Tsugumi. And Chie, the potatoes were really tasty!\r\nReimi: Thank you for helping us... It was fun.\r\nRena: Thanks for everything! Maybe it's a bit imprudent, but it was nice having you take us around places.\r\nMillie: Same! I wish we could've done some sightseeing in the end...\r\nWelch: Tomorrow! At least wait until tomorrowwww!!\r\nMillie: ...I think we'd better go today.\r\nMaria: So long, toji.\r\nMihono: They vanished...\r\nMai: It'd be nice if we saw them again... but it's probably hard to do.\r\nChie: They did come from another world's future, after all.\r\nYui: I wish I could've had just one more day with them.\r\nTsugumi: Now then... the real problem starts here.\r\nYui: Eh?\r\nTsugumi: I already secured a budget for doing this research.\r\nTsugumi: And I know it's destined for failure... so what now?"}, {"paste_key": "D67evZgF", "title": "5-7 Awakening", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/D67evZgF", "timestamp": "", "hits": "108", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "I can't link the youtube videos here because they trigger the warning for offensive content somehow. Sorry, but you'll have to get that yourself.\r\n\r\n1: To See Her\r\n\r\nYui: Are you there, Hana-san? It's Yamashiro.\r\nYui: Things are kind of a mess right now, so I'm just leaving you a message.\r\nYui: ............\r\nYui: ...Mihono-chan... got put in confinement. They said, we won't get to see her again...\r\nYui: What should I do, Hana-san...\r\n\r\nHana: What do you mean, Mihono got put in confinement!?\r\nYui: Ah-- Hana-san...\r\nMirja: It's been some time, Suzumoto Hana. You finally came to see us.\r\nHana: Mirja-senpai... I still don't know... how I'm supposed to face all of you...\r\nHana: But still...!\r\nHana: I heard that Mihono got put in confinement... Does it have to do with that great aradama!?\r\nMirja: ...Did Yamashiro Yui tell you about that?\r\nYui: ...I'm sorry. I felt like, I should let Hana-san know...\r\nMirja: I don't mean to criticize you for it.\r\nMirja: ...It makes this conversation quicker. Asakura Mihono is in a state where there's no telling when the great aradama's power will run rampant.\r\nMirja: You understand the danger of the situation... don't you?\r\nHana: I do...\r\nMirja: When Asakura Mihono lost control of the great aradama's power, it was decided that she would be put in confinement.\r\nHana: She lost control!? How's Mihono doing!?\r\nMirja: ...She's fine, for now.\r\nHana: Thank goodness...\r\nHana: ...? By the way, where's the rest of the investigation team?\r\nMirja: Ban Tsugumi is at her research lab.\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki and Musumi Kiyoka... went to the Ministry of Defense. Setouchi Chie joined them, to make sure they didn't do anything unreasonable.\r\nMirja: ...Though, as I see it, Setouchi Chie herself is the one most likely to be unreasonable...\r\nHana: The Ministry of Defense?\r\nMirja: Do you remember the facility where Takirihime was held in custody?\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono has been quarantined in that same facility.\r\nHana: ...Alright. I'm going to the Ministry of Defense too.\r\nMirja: There's no point in going.\r\nHana: Huh?\r\nMirja: ...We're forbidden from meeting with her. The three of them know they can't see her... but I suppose they couldn't wait here.\r\nHana: But, then... Mihono...\r\nMirja: We can't leave here unattended, so the two of us remained behind...\r\nYui: ...To be honest, we don't know what to do. I went along with Kiyoka-chan and them at first, but they wouldn't listen to anything we said.\r\nHana: ......!\r\nHana: Let's see Mihono.\r\nYui: If they'd let anybody in, we would... but...\r\nHana: The investigation team can do it. The team's attached to the Origami family now, isn't it?\r\nYui: Ah!\r\nMirja: ......\r\nMirja: I had considered that possibility myself, but...\r\nHana: It might be mixing up private and official matters pretty badly... but that's not what matters most right now.\r\nHana: Let's go and see Mihono!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Visit (1)\r\n\r\nMirja: Thank you very much for hearing out our unreasonable request, Origami Yukari-sama.\r\nYukari: I was concerned for Asakura as well.\r\nYukari: Though... This is likely the first and last meeting we'll get. I can't keep making this happen.\r\nChie: I understand.\r\nYukari: ...Let's go.\r\n\r\nKanami: Huh? The investigation team's here?\r\nKofuki: What're you two doing here?\r\nHiyori: ...It's our assignment.\r\nYukari: We had the two of them stationed here. There aren't many toji who would be able to respond to Asakura when she loses control.\r\nKiyoka: Then, you two get to see Hono-chan...\r\nKanami: ...No, we don't get to visit her either.\r\nHiyori: The only time we'd get to see her... is when we have to stop her from rampaging.\r\nKiyoka: But then... does that mean, you're only here for if you have to cut down Hono-chan...?\r\nHiyori: ...... So, why are you...\r\nHiyori: ...Oh, you came to see Mihono.\r\nKanami: Good...\r\nKanami: Ever since Mihono-chan got locked up here, she probably hasn't gotten to see anybody...\r\nHana: Is there anything... you want us to tell Mihono for you?\r\nKanami: ...Just tell her, I'm sorry.\r\nHana: Eh?\r\nKanami: Sorry, that I couldn't do anything for her...\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nChie: We all... feel the same way... None of us could do anything...\r\nYui: Chie-san...\r\nHana: I'll make sure... she knows.\r\nHiyori: ...Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Visit (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Ah... Chii-nee... Guys...\r\nKofuki: Dang, Mihocchi. Haven't you been doing enough crying lately?\r\nMihono: But... they said... I'd never get to see anybody again...\r\nChie: I know... I know...!\r\nYui: This is too horrible! She's going to get all messed up, locked up in here by herself!\r\nMirja: Is there any hope of improving her conditions, Origami Yukari-sama?\r\nYukari: I could arrange for a better environment... but anything more would be difficult.\r\nYukari: ...Asakura. What have they told you, in regards to your treatment?\r\nMihono: They said, I can't ever leave here again... that it was for the good of the world...\r\nYui: Huh!? Losing Mihono-chan is way worse for the world!\r\nKiyoka: If we could do something about Kanayamahime... then, could Hono-chan leave here?\r\nYukari: If the great aradama within Asakura could be suppressed or fully sealed... it could happen.\r\nMirja: But... with what we have now, that would be effectively impossible...\r\nTsugumi: ...Then there's nothing else we can do. I'm going to pay a visit to Hitakami-san.\r\nChie: Tsugumi-chan!?\r\nTsugumi: Hitakami-san is currently the one with the most information on Kanayamahime.\r\nKofuki: Yeah... maybe that's a good idea.\r\nKiyoka: Kofuki-san! We don't need help from the kind of people who'd do those experiments! Let's save Hono-chan ourselves!\r\nKofuki: The whole reason this happened is cause we can't do that!\r\nKiyoka: That doesn't mean...\r\nMihono: Don't fight!\r\nKiyoka/Kofuki: ...\r\nMihono: I don't want to have to see you guys fighting...\r\nMihono: I'm fine, with staying here like this, so...\r\nChie: Mihono-chan...? What are you saying...?\r\nMihono: This whole time... I've been thinking by myself. Why all this had to happen.\r\nMihono: ...But, instead of being swallowed up by Kanayamahime, it'd be better if I just stayed locked up here...\r\nHana: ...I can't stand seeing you that weak, Mihono.\r\nMihono: Hana?\r\nHana: ...It's been a while.\r\nHana: I'm sorry... for not being there when you were going through so much.\r\nMihono: It's fine... I'm just glad you came to see me. I really am...\r\nYui: Hana-san's the one who came up with this, Mihono-chan. How, if we asked Yukari-sama, we could get special permission to see you.\r\nHana: We just used how the investigation team is working for the Origami family. We did have to bend the rules for it.\r\nHana: But, it was the right thing to do.\r\nHana: ...Don't try to sacrifice yourself, Mihono. Nobody wants you to do that.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nHana: You always looked best when you're saving somebody else... Whenever you're holding up your okatana as a toji.\r\nHana: Way better than wallowing in self-sacrifice in this place.\r\nHana: So... don't give up here. If the investigation team didn't have you... I couldn't take it.\r\nMihono: Hana...\r\nHana: All of us are wanting you to come back. Nobody thinks it'd be better if you stayed here, okay?\r\nHanae: That goes for Kanami-san and Hiyori-san too.\r\nMihono: Kanami and Juujou-san?\r\nYui: They're both right outside.\r\nYui: And, they're really depressed they couldn't do anything for you.\r\nYui: I'm sure everybody else feels the same way!\r\nMihono: ......\r\nChie: So please, don't give up now... We want to have more time with you...\r\nMihono: I mean... I want that too...\r\nMihono: Is it okay... if I still keep hoping for that...? Can I still... keep wanting to be with you...?\r\nChie: You shouldn't have to ask...\r\nMihono: Chii-nee... I want to get out of here... Help me...\r\nChie: I know... I will...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: I Want to Be With My Friends (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: ......Sigh, they're all gone again.\r\nMihono: But... Yeah. I'm feeling better. I mean, I never got to talk to anybody ever since they put me in here.\r\nMihono: ............\r\nMihono: UWAAAAHH------!\r\nMihono: I was hugging Chii-nee and crying right in front of everybody!? Now I'm all embarrassed thinking back on it--!\r\nMihono: ...Aha, what am I even doing anymore.\r\nMihono: I guess I felt like there was nothing I could do... but... I'm fine now.\r\nMihono: They all haven't given up yet. So, I'm... definitely not giving up either!\r\n\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMihono: ............\r\n\r\nMihono: Kanayamahime...\r\nMihono: Do you want to tell me something?\r\nMihono: ............\r\nMihono: ...I'm not going to give up.\r\nMihono: I thought, so long as I stayed in here... that might be what's best...\r\nMihono: But, everybody said they want me with them.\r\nMihono: So, I'm going to get out of here no matter what... I'm going to get back to them.\r\nMihono: Back to the investigation team... Back to Chii-nee, and Kiyoka, Fukki, Mirja-san, Yui, Tsugumi-san, Hana... Kanami and everybody...\r\nMihono: Cause I still want to be a toji!\r\nMihono: So I'll do it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: I Want to Be With My Friends (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: ...Eh?\r\nMihono: Oh no-- they got attacked...! ...Wait?\r\nMihono: Why do I... have Kashuu Kiyomitsu...?\r\nMihono: Did...\r\nMihono: I... attack them?\r\nMihono: N-No...\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan!! ...!? That's...\r\nMihono: Kanami... It's not like that, it's not...\r\nHiyori: Did you...\r\nMihono: No, I wasn't; I didn't mean to...\r\nKanami: We get it! We get it, okay, so... Calm down, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: ...I didn't want, this... I still wanted, to be with everybody...\r\nHiyori: MIHONO!!\r\nMihono: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Destroy Kanayamahime\r\n\r\nIn the dead of night--\r\n\r\nAkira: ......\r\nYuuki: ...Why do you think she called us for this late?\r\nAkira: ...You'll know when Makocchan gets here. Anyway, how're you feeling now?\r\nAkira: Your cold doing better?\r\nYuuki: Yep, I feel fine now. If anything, I feel like I'd get weaker if I rested any more.\r\nAkira: Alright.\r\nAkira: ...If it ever feels like too much for you, let me know. It's gonna be a rough night.\r\nYuuki: ...Akira-nee-sama? Do you know what's going on?\r\nMakoto: ......\r\nMakoto: Inago, Toribane.\r\nAkira/Yuuki: Yes.\r\nMakoto: It seems that Kanayamahime has awakened.\r\nAkira: ......Yeah.\r\nYuuki: Why are you so calm about that!?\r\nYuuki: What are you talking about, Nee-sama!? What about Mihono-san...\r\nMakoto: Kanayamahime cut down the toji guarding her and is currently missing.\r\nAkira: ...!\r\nMakoto: Strike down and exorcise Kanayamahime at once. This is what tamayori toji are for.\r\nYuuki: ......\r\nMakoto: You'll take care of it, won't you?\r\nAkira: I will.\r\nYuuki: ......I will.\r\nYuuki: I really wish it didn't come to this... but, if you order it, Makoto-nee-sama, then that's all there is to it.\r\nYuuki: I'll strike down Kanayamahime.\r\nAkira: Makocchan.\r\nMakoto: Yes?\r\nAkira: About Yuuki...\r\nMakoto: What about Toribane?\r\nAkira: ......Nah, it's nothing. Let's go.\r\nYuuki: Right!\r\nMakoto: ............\r\nMakoto: ...Is there anyone there?\r\nHitakami Toji: What do you need?\r\nMakoto: Please make this announcement to all toji.\r\nMakoto: We, the Hitakami faction, will destroy Kanayamahime! Allow Inago and Toribane to reach Kanayamahime by all means!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Suppression Order (1)\r\n\r\nAt that time--\r\n\r\nMaki: Everyone's here, Yukari-sama.\r\nYukari: ...Kanayamahime has awakened. Her current whereabouts are unknown.\r\nEveryone: !?\r\nChie: That can't be... Why...?\r\nKiyoka: No... She said she wouldn't give up..\r\nYui: Mihono-chan...\r\nKofuki: ...!!\r\nKofuki: Hey! What the hell did you do to Mihocchi!? This came out of nowhere... This is bullshit!\r\nMirja: ...Get a hold of yourself, Shichinosato Kofuki. Origami Yukari-sama, could we have an explanation?\r\nYukari: If you want to know the specifics, you should hear it from them. ...Etou, Juujou.\r\nKanami: ...Okay.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan and I were waiting on alert at the Ministry of Defense, in case Mihono-chan lost control...\r\nKofuki: Who gives a shit about that!?\r\nKofuki: Tell us what happened!\r\nKanami: ......\r\nHiyori: ......Mihono attacked someone.\r\nKofuki: .........Huh? You think this is a joke or what?\r\nKofuki: Oi, give me a real answer, Kanami!\r\nKanami: ......\r\nKofuki: Say something!\r\nHiyori: It's the truth! \r\nHiyori: When Kanami and I heard Mihono went berserk, we went to see her.\r\nHiyori: And when we got there... we saw toji on the floor and Mihono standing over them.\r\nTsugumi: ...Did Asakura-san really do it? Or did it just look that way?\r\nHiyori: ...Who could have made it look like that?\r\nTsugumi: ......That's fair.\r\nHana: ...\r\nMirja: ...What condition are the toji she attacked in?\r\nMaki: It seems like it only went as far as them losing utsushi. Thankfully, it wasn't life threatening.\r\nMai: At that point... was it already Kanayamahime?\r\nHiyori: No...\r\nHiyori: It was Mihono.\r\nKanami: There's no way Mihono-chan could have wanted to hurt anyone though...\r\nKanami: She was really panicked and afraid...\r\nKanami: Seeing her like that...\r\nMai: ...\r\nMai: So Mihono-chan attacked them with her okatana?\u3000\r\nKofuki: Hey! She just said Mihocchi didn't want to hurt anybody!!\r\nSayaka: Stop, Kofuki.\r\nKofuki: Why should I!? They're the ones treating Mihocchi like she tried to kill somebody!\r\nMai: It doesn't make sense...\r\nSayaka: Mai? What do you mean...?\r\nMai: Why would Mihono-chan have her okatana?\r\nChie: ...Eh?\r\nMirja: ...True, you're absolutely right.\r\nMirja: After being placed in confinement, Asakura Mihono should not have had Kashuu Kiyomitsu with her. Isn't that right?\r\nMai: Yes.\r\nSuzuka: Kashuu Kiyomitsu was confiscated while Asakura-san was confined. It's currently in secure custody... or should have been. It seems that someone brought it out.\r\nEllen: ...On top of that, there's one other thing that caught my attention.\r\nEllen: Kanamin and Hiyoyon, you two were stationed at the Ministry of Defense in case Mihomiho went berserk, right?\r\nEllen: So then, why did some other toji go up against Mihomiho before you two?\r\nKaoru:\u3000...This whole thing's fishy.\r\nKaoru: I don't who, but somebody's going around pulling the strings here.\r\nMihono: Mai... did somebody frame Mihono?\r\nMai: ...I think that's probably it.\r\nMai: In order to make Kanayamahime awaken...\r\nYukari: The Hitakami faction is already taking action. If you want to save Asakura... you'll have to reach her before the Hitakami faction does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Suppression Order (2)\r\n\r\nMaki: Once you've decided on your plan, let us know. We'll follow along with it.\r\nMirja: The Special Defense Team will be assisting us?\r\nMaki: It's on Akane-sama's order.\r\nHiyori: With all these top toji, we can settle this quick. I'll use my Hitotsu no Tachi.\r\nKanami: You can't do that, Hiyori-chan!\r\nKanami: Even if it brings Mihono-chan back, there's no point if you're gone!\r\nHiyori: Still, we don't have any other options.\r\nMirja: No, Etou Kanami is correct here.\r\nMirja: If you were to use Hitotsu no Tachi to suppress Kanayamahime, there's the potential for it to repeat the effects of the Kamakura Special Hazardous Waste Leakage Issue.\r\nMirja: In the current state of things, with the rampant frequency of aradama appearances, using Hitotsu no Tachi poses too much of a risk.\r\nFriedman: Thinking about that won't do us much good now though.\r\nEllen: Grandpa!\r\nKaoru: What's the old man doing here?\r\nFriedman: I thought I might be some help.\r\nFriedman: Whether or not this could repeat the effects of the Special Hazardous Waste Leakage Issue, there's too little information on just what kind of aradama Kanayamahime is.\r\nFriedman: We could just as easily assume it would do the same thing as with Tagitsuhime, or that it wouldn't.\r\nKaoru: So we're in the dark.\r\nFriedman: ...You all have the choice of three paths to commit to. The first: consider Mihono-kun as Kanayamahime and suppress her.\r\nKiyoka: We're not going to do that!\r\nFriedman: I know. The second: Hiyori-kun will use Hitotsu no Tachi, saving Mihono-kun.\r\nKanami: We're not doing that either.\r\nFriedman: Then, the third option: Mihono-kun is saved, without sacrificing Hiyori-kun.\r\nChie: There's a way to make that happen...?\r\nFriedman: ...I'm sorry to say, we haven't found a means to doing that.\r\nFriedman: Still, there isn't very much time to mull it over. The tamayori toji are already making their move.\r\nMirja: ...We'll move out as well.\r\nMirja: If we can't find Asakura Mihono before the Hitakami Faction does, she won't survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: An Unfortunate Run-In\r\n\r\nChie: Mihono-chan... Where'd you...\r\nKiyoka: Even though we tried looking places Hono-chan might've gone, she isn't anywhere...\r\nMirja: Right now, the one moving Asakura Mihono's body is Kanayamahime.\r\nMirja: If she were there, it would be a stroke of luck...\r\nKaoru: So we're out of leads...\r\nTsugumi: Fighting has broken out between Asakura-san and other toji.\r\nChie: --!\r\nMai: Was anyone hurt...?\r\nTsugumi: There's no need to worry. While some toji were injured, none of the injuries are severe.\r\nChie: Thank goodness...\r\nTsugumi: Currently, they're in pursuit while maintaining a distance. I'll send you the relevant data.\r\nKanami: Let's go, everybody!\r\n\r\nHiyori: --! Hold on!\r\nKaoru: What's wrong, Hiyori?\r\nKanami: ...Someone's coming!\r\nAkira: Whoa there!\r\nEllen: Akira!\r\nAkira: The hell; the whole gang's here.\r\nAkira: Normally, this could be a good brawl, but... Sorry. We don't got time to deal with you now.\r\nAkira: ...Out of the way.\r\nKofuki: Fuck you! How about you get lost!\r\nYuuki: ...There's some rowdy people in our way.\r\nYuuki: Though... it's lucky we ran into you here! I'll make up for what happened last time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: Yume and Yuuki (1)\r\n\r\nYuuki: TSUBAKURO YUMEEEEEEEEEE!\r\nYume: Whoopsie.\r\nYume: Umm... Who were you again?\r\nYuuki: Don't make light of me!\r\nMaki: That's Toribane Yuuki, Yume.\r\nYume: Ahh, from that one time! I couldn't tell cause you're wearing that stuff.\r\nYume: But, you're still just as weak, huh.\r\nYuuki: Screw you!\r\nYume: This's that tamayori thing? Even with that on, is that all you can do?\r\nAkira: You sure talk a big game! Then, how about you take me on too!\r\nYume: Ahaha! You're ganging up on me?\r\nYuuki: Nee-sama! I'll defeat Tsubakuro Yume myself!\r\nAkira: I'm not letting you have all the fun! Let me join in on this!!\r\nYuuki: ...It's first come, first serve!\r\nYume: That's more like it! It's finally getting fun!\r\n\r\nSuzuka: What a hotheaded bunch. Though, this works in our favor.\r\nMaki: Right. ...The rest of you go on ahead. We'll take care of things here.\r\nMirja: With this many of them...\r\nMirja: Will that really be fine?\r\nMaki: It'll take more than that to make a difference to us... Get going!\r\nSuzuka: More than this? Were you trying to show off?\r\nMaki: Still, we can handle this, can't we?\r\nSuzuka: I suppose. ...Oh?\r\nYomi: ...Reinforcements.\r\nMaki: (I wanted to go back up Yume, but... That's not happening with this many of them.)\r\nMaki: (No, even against two tamayori toji, Yume'll definitely win.)\r\nMaki: (So there's only one thing we have to do!)\r\nMaki: That's still not going to be enough against us.\r\nMaki: If you're looking to bring down the Special Defense Team, you should have brought twice that!\r\nMaki: HAAAAAAAAAAAH!!\r\n\r\nAkira: ORAAAAAAA!\r\nYume: Whoa!\r\nYuuki: Stop only fighting Akira-nee-sama! I want to smack you down too!\r\nYume: --!!\r\nYume: (Fighting both of them is actually pretty tough, but...)\r\nYume: Ahaha!\r\nYume: This is finally getting exciting. Hey... you can go harder than that, can't you?\r\nAkira: --!?\r\nYume: Well?\r\nAkira: Course we can!! Yuuki!!\r\nYuuki: Yes!\r\nYuuki: I'll make sure... you'll never forget the name Yuuki!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: Yume and Yuuki (2)\r\n\r\nYume: Ungh...!?\r\nYuuki: Is that it, Tsubakuro Yume!? Is that the best you've got!? HAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nYume: (She's going to hit head on...! I have to use kongoushin...!)\r\nYume: ......\r\nYume: ...Huh?\r\nYuuki: [pant gasp]...\r\nAkira: Yuuki!?\r\nYume: What're you falling over for!? You're ruining all the fun!\r\nAkira: (The side effects of tamayori are kicking in!? What do I do!? Bring Yuuki back home? Or do I just...) \r\nHitakami Toji: Etou Kanami and the others have made contact with Kanayamahime!\r\nAkira: Shit! Why'd this have to happen now!\r\nAkira: (Tsubakuro Yume's exhausted from the fighting. I should be able to get away on my own...)\r\nAkira: ...The mission comes first!

I'm sure that'll be the most efficient outcome.\r\nSuu: ...But, I wanted to go home-!\r\nSayaka: We can go home after we find who sent these messages, so you try your best too, Suu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Hint is Always Right Beside You\r\n\r\nHiyori: \"1-middle, 1-down, 4-down, 2-middle, 0-up\"... So, it's numbers, and... What's the up, down, and middle part about? Some kind of location, or direction?\r\nMirja: I wonder what rules it's following. They gave a hint that it has to do with our phones, but... Hmm.\r\nSuu: Aghh, I keep sending Hokuto-san Happy New Year's texts, but she isn't responding to any-!\r\nHirona: ...That's amazing, Inami-san.\r\nHirona: You're writing those texts unbelievably fast.\r\nSuu: Eh, am I really that fast?\r\nHiyori: ...How are you going that fast pressing the screen so few times?\r\nHirona: ......She's using flick inputs. Inami-san, please demonstrate.\r\nSuu: Just watch me!\r\nSuu: With flick inputs, if you want \"A\", tap A. If you want \"Ke\", tap Ka and flick it to the right, see? For \"O\", go down... like that!\r\nHirona: [clap clap clap]~...\r\nHiyori: So, if you tap and keep it right in the middle, you get A sounds. Left gets you I sounds. Up gets U sounds... Right gets E sounds. Down gets O sounds... And you can write like that...?\r\nSuu: You'll mess up at first, but once you get used to it, it's a lot faster.\r\nHirona: ...\r\nHirona: Excuuse... me. I figured out that code... I think.\r\nMirja: Did you, Nitta Hirona? Please explain.\r\nHirona: Okaay.\r\n\r\nHirona: The numbers in here apply to each line of the Japanese alphabet. 1 is the A column, 2 is the Ka column, 3 is the Sa column, 5 is the Ta column... and so on.\r\nHirona: \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0.\" \"A, Ka, Sa, Ta, Na, Ha, Ma, Ya, Ra, Wa.\" --If you write it out easier to understand, it's like this.\r\nHirona: And, the middle and down part is, when you use flick input, the direction you flick it.\r\nHirona: So the directions point to each column of the Japanese alphabet, or which vowel to use in each line...\r\nKiyoka: Oh! You change the input, but you tap the A column and number at the same place!\r\nKaoru: When you put it like that, it makes sense.\r\nSuu: So... 1-middle is \"A\". 1-down is \"O\". 4-down is \"To\". 2-middle is \"Ka\". And last is 0-up, \"N\". Is that it?\r\nSayaka: Aoto... kan.\r\nMirja: It's Aoto-kan? It's true that it's popular among certain young girls... Toji like ourselves. And, if the input method on our phones is the key they mentioned, there's no questioning it.\r\nHiyori: That place isn't far from here. Guess we should run over there.\r\nKaoru: Hiyori... I'm surprised to see her getting so into this. Does she actually like this kinda thing?\r\nKiyoka: If you invite Juujou-san along, she'll come up with some reason to join in.\r\nKaoru: Well, as long as she's having fun.\r\n\r\nHiyori: It's closed. Probably should have expected that, since it's New Year's Day.\r\nMirja: For now, let's send a photo of Aoto-kan's exterior as we were instructed.\r\nMirja: ...I'm surprised to get a response almost immediately after sending it, but, is this another code?\r\nMirja: --\"Head to 111121145's former research facility.\"\r\nSayaka: ...The place where the research facility is became numbers?\r\nKaoru: They're not making it easy on us, but it sounds like it from how they wrote it. Did you get another hint, Sayaka?\r\nSayaka: I didn't get one.\r\nSuu: Making us do this without a hint is a huge difficulty spike out of nowhere, isn't it-?\r\nKiyoka: Ah, take a look at this. The paper on the door to Aoto-kan...!\r\nHiyori: \"Greetings, Happy New Year\" ...and afterwards is...\r\nHiyori: \"1, 15, 20, 15, 11, 1, 14. owner, Aoto Youji.\"\r\nMirja: This is likely the same as the previous code.\r\nKiyoka: Do you think this is a hint, maybe? Like... these numbers represent Aoto-kan, or something.\r\nSuu: But, isn't the amount of numbers different...? \r\nMirja: The first question was in hiragana, but this one might be in some other alphabet.\r\nMirja: Then, if these numbers do represent Aoto-kan as Musumi Kiyoka suggests, the \"1\" at the start is very likely \"A\".\r\nSayaka: ...This is hard.\r\nKaoru: You're supposed to spend New Year's under a kotatsu with mikan. It's basically the law... But this is probably gonna keep us stuck here for a while.\r\nKaoru: Nn... Wait, it's my phone this time. What now... \"The place of origin of certain okatana.\" What's that about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Is Cracking Codes Business as Usual for Toji?\r\n\r\nSuu: \"Head to 111121145's former research facility\"...\r\nSuu: It says that, but, this code... Does it make any sense at all? I'm hitting max hopelessness here; I can't think of anything anymoreee.\r\nKaoru: Don't force it, just take it easy-. I feel like passing on this one too.\r\nKiyoka: Ah--! The amount of numbers here, this has to be it when you write it with the English alphabet...!\r\nKiyoka: A, O, T, O, K, A, N. With seven of them, you get Aoto-kan.\r\nHiyori: So A is 1, then O is 15, T is 20, K is 11, and N is 14?\r\nKiyoka: Exactly. I think these numbers probably apply to the English alphabet starting from 1 in ABC order.\r\nSuu: Wow... Kiyoka-san! I think you're right.\r\nMirja: In that case, let's examine the string of numbers \"111121145\" piece by piece.\r\nMirja: The first sequence of 1s could be 1 or 11. And, as there are 26 characters in the English alphabet, it's reasonable to assume the end is 5 and not 45.\r\nSayaka: E is the fifth letter, so the end is \"E\". Or, a syllable that ends with \"e\".\r\nMirja: The next question is whether the number in front of the 5 is a 4 or a 14.\r\nMirja: If it's a 4, that would make it D, so the end is \"De\". If it's a 14, it would be N, so it reads as \"Ne\".\r\nKaoru: This one's definitely gonna take a lot longer than the hint, since they broke Aoto-kan up by letters.\r\nMirja: That's true. Then, let's move to the first number, 1, or \"A\".\r\nMirja: There is a chance it could be 11, or K, but if it were 11 and 11 then it would be read as Kk, which wouldn't make sense, so we can exclude it.\r\nKiyoka: Which means, the name of the next place we go either starts with \"Kaa\" or \"Aka\", but I think \"Aka\" sounds right. Right, Mirja-san?\r\nMirja: Yes, I reached the same conclusion. After all, our next destination is a former research facility, and the hint Mashiko Kaoru received was that it's \"the place of origin of certain okatana.\"\r\nMirja: I realized it's a place that we, the investigation team, were very familiar with.\r\nHirona: Ahh... Since you're... the Akabane sword investigation team?\r\nKiyoka: Yeah. If you split up the numbers like this, you get \"1, 11, 1, 2, 1, 14, 5.\"\r\nKiyoka: If you match it up with the English alphabet, then it's \"A, K, A, B, A, N, E\". Akabane.\r\nMirja: We did previously investigate the 5th Physiological Research Institute in Akabane, and it does match the description of a former research facility. If that's our destination, I can guide us there.\r\nHiyori: With how closely it matches, it doesn't seem likely it'd be anything else.\r\nSayaka: The 5th Physiological Research Institute in Akabane... Let's go. I think Mirja and Kiyoka got it right.\r\nKaoru: 'kay, let's get going-. You know, I feel like I had to solve a riddle like this before.\r\n\r\nSuu: It's kind of dark and creepy here...!\r\nHirona: ...It looks as abandoned as you'd expect for an unused building. Did you get any additional instructions?\r\nKiyoka: It doesn't seem like it yet.\r\nSayaka: Come over here. There's something written on the floor in chalk.\r\nMirja: The chalk is hardly eroded, so I suppose that means this is our next code.\r\nMirja: --\"Head to where the 6023NJ141 is performed\" ...is what it says.\r\nHiyori: There's numbers and letters this time. Even if we tried the same rules as last time... it wouldn't work because there's a 0, would it? Though, maybe it's not a 0, but a capital O...\r\nKiyoka: Hmm, I wonder what they mean by a place where something's performed...?\r\n\r\nHirona: I'm at a loss... completely.\r\nSayaka: Kaoru... Did you figure out anything?\r\nKaoru: What're you asking me for? It's not like I'm all that great with this stuff...\r\nSayaka: But, when I don't know what to do, you and Ellen always help.\r\nKaoru: Well... I don't know if it's the right move here, but just plain solving the riddle isn't the only approach.\r\nKaoru: When we started out, they said \"Focusing on aradama will help you.\"\r\nKaoru: First was Aoto-kan. Then the abandoned building that had to do with the Akabane swords. So, wouldn't the next place also have to do with toji and aradama?\r\nKiyoka: That makes sense. Ah... They messaged me this time! I'll read it out.\r\nKiyoka: --\"It's just as important to focus on appearances. Pay attention to the shapes.\" --\"It's a place where those who fight with okatana in hand gather.\"\r\nSayaka: Half of it was just like Kaoru said.\r\nKaoru: Come on, if you're gonna give us a hint, do it sooner...\r\nHirona: ...It's kind of mean of them, isn't it.\r\nMirja: --6023NJ141.\r\nMirja: Why don't we focus on the shapes of these letters and numbers for the time being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Place Where the Codes Connect\r\n\r\nKiyoka: ...6.0.2.3.N.J.1.4.1. They told us to look at the shapes, but I don't even know where to begin.\r\nKaoru: ......\r\nHiyori: Maybe the shapes are similar to something...\r\nSuu: What's 6 similar to... If you look at it upside down, I guess it's a 9?\r\nMirja: It could be a good way of looking at it. However, thinking of 6 as 9 doesn't seem like it will help make any significant progress.\r\nSayaka: ...Kaoru, what were you looking on your phone for?\r\nKaoru: Just reading back through the messages Ellen sent me over winter break. Ahh, there it is. Right here. Look at this.\r\nSayaka: ?\r\nKaoru: \"H3110 KAORU! How are you spending your winter break?\" See how it says that?\r\nKaoru: The part at the start; doesn't that kinda look like this code? With the numbers and the letters.\r\nSuu: Ah! That \"H3110\" is \"Hello\", isn't it. I used to play around writing like that with my friends.\r\nKaoru: That's how it works.\r\nMirja: It's true that it's similar in some places. Like how 3 is substituted for E, though the orientation is inverted.\r\nHiyori: So they're replacing letters with numbers? That sounds like a good clue.\r\nKaoru: Don't worry about it. I already found a chart for swapping these. You can find a lot of this stuff on the internet.\r\nKaoru: I'll say what 6023NJ141 swaps into, so somebody write it down. 6 is \"G\", 0 is \"O\", 2 is... \"Z\", probably. 3 is \"E\".\r\nKaoru: And then, we should be able to leave \"N\" and \"J\" as is. 1 is either \"I\" or \"L\". 4 should be \"A\". Cause it looks like a lowercase \"a\".\r\nHirona: Then that means 6023NJ141 is... \"GOZENJIAI\"?\r\nSayaka: The place we have to go to next is where they hold the tournament (gozenjiai)?\r\nHiyori: There's the martial arts hall where they hold preliminaries with representatives from each school. But, they probably mean... the place where they hold the finals, don't you think?\r\nKaoru: That place did leave a pretty crazy impression. All thanks to a couple people I know.\r\nHiyori: ...Hmph. Either way, are we going to be able to get in there on New Year's morning?\r\nMirja: Let's go and check for now. It won't do us any good staying here.\r\nSuu: Yeah. I don't want to be here too long, and I'm a little bit curious to see what's next on this riddle solving tour!\r\nKaoru: It doesn't sound that \"little bit\" curious anymore. Though, since we came this far, we might as well go along too.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: They let us in...\r\nMirja: We can interpret that as us being correct to come here... No wait, I just got a message. That settles it.\r\nMirja: The subject is: \"This is the final riddle. After that your reward is waiting.\"\r\nSuu: There's got to be a reward for solving riddles, after all. If they don't have one, that's a scam! A scam!\r\nHirona: Inami-san... you sure got excited about this. You switch on and off, I get iit.\r\nSuu: After coming this far, you have to get excited for it! Otherwise it'd be like going to a joint live and leaving just before your idol comes out!\r\nSayaka: I'm glad you want to do it, Suu. Mirja, what's the riddle?\r\nMirja: I'll read it out loud.\r\nMirja: --\"Think back over today, and visit the shrine dedicated to the god linked to the following 3.\"\r\nMirja: \"2-middle, 7-left, 9-left\". \"201921182179\". \"N4M42U\".\r\nMirja: They specifically advise us to think back over today, so I suppose that means to solve the codes using the previous solutions and guess a specific shrine from these keywords.\r\nHirona: We know how to solve them, so this should go quick... ...That's helpfull.\r\nHiyori: ...I got a message too? \"The hint this time is you yourself.\" ...What does that mean?\r\nKiyoka: Hmm, so then it has some connection to Juujou-san?\r\nKaoru: The shrine's on the Yamato Plain... That's gotta be it.\r\nHiyori: That's it. I'm going to kill you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: The Future the Present Reaches\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Okay, let's start by cracking the codes. The first is \"2-middle, 7-left, 9-left\". If you put that into a phone, it's... \"Ka\" \"Mi\" \"Na\" Ri\" (thunder).\r\nHirona: Thunder... A natural phenomenonn. I'll write it down.\r\nSayaka: Next is \"201921182179\". These numbers are the alphabet. You replace them counting from 1, 2, 3 starting from A.\r\nSayaka: So Z becomes 26. There's no 0, so the first one has to be the 20th letter of the alphabet.\r\nSuu: T!\r\nKaoru: There wouldn't be 79 either, so the last one has to be 9. And, the 9th letter is I.\r\nMirja: These 12 numbers separate into 20, 19, 21, 18, 21, 7, 9 which equals in that order: T, S, U, R, U, G, I.\r\nHiyori: Reading it out... you get tsurugi (sword). It has to be swords.\r\nHirona: I did the last one, \"N4M42U\"... Comparing it to what Mashiko-san found online, it's \"NAMAZU\"u.\r\nHirona: Namazu... It's a fish. Ahh... By the way, did you know, replacing letters with characters that look vaguely similar is called \"leetspeak\"?\r\nSayaka: Thunder, swords, namazu. Does anyone know what shrine has a god that's related to these?\r\nKaoru: Oi, Sayaka. You're forgetting the most important one. Thunder, swords, namazu, and, horizon chest.\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nKaoru: Try putting your hand on that chest of yours. Anything come to mind?\r\nHiyori: ...It does. But, let me say one thing. I've been thinking this for a while, but you really don't have the right to talk down to me here, do you?\r\nKaoru: Maybe I don't. But I'll do it anyway. \r\nHiyori: You're...... Whatever. Let's get back to the question. When you think of thunder, swords, and namazu, the Japanese god connected to them is Takemikazuchi. He's the god of both thunder and swords.\r\nHiyori: There was also a widely believed anecdote about him sealing a namazu that was thought to be causing earthquakes.\r\nKiyoka: Do you have any idea which shrine is dedicated to Takemikazuchi?\r\nHiyori: At Kashima Shrine. Since I was the hint. It's where the style of swordfighting I use, Kashima Shinto-ryu, is supposed to have originated.\r\nHirona: Then, that settles it-.\r\nHiyori: If it is Kashima Shrine... you realize that's in Kashima City in Ibaraki. Are we going to catch trains all the way there?\r\nMirja: A helicopter showing up now? I suppose that means we should get on board. There's no other choice if we're going.\r\nSuu: EHH-----!?\r\nSuu: WE'RE GETTING ON THAT!?\r\n\r\nMirja: This is where the mystery person sending us messages should be.\r\nKaoru: They'll probably be coming around any second now.\r\nEllen: Kaoru-! Happy New Year! You all did really well-!\r\nKaoru: What'd you send us on this whole goose chase for right on New Year's... I'm supposed to be sitting under a kotatsu eating mikan right about now.\r\nEllen: Sorry, but I was only here to help out. The evil mastermind is-- Grandpa!\r\nFriedman: Hahaha, you could put it nicer than that, Ellen.\r\nMirja: ...Dr. Richard Friedman!?\r\nSuu: There's a celebrity!?\r\nSayaka: Why are you here?\r\nFriedman: I wanted to give you a little surprise as a New Year's greeting.\r\nHiyori: It didn't seem that little... You went all out. What was the point of all this?\r\nFriedman: It might be a bit late to say it, and I know it's preaching to the choir, but I wanted to give you another chance to think about toji and aradama while having some fun.\r\nFriedman: All the places you visited today were related to the two of them, weren't they?\r\nMirja: Yes, and they were places we had a personal connection to as well.\r\nFriedman: This nation has spent a long time with aradama. Even if that relationship and the state of things shift, that connection is likely going to remain.\r\nFriedman: And, as toji in service, you all have the ability to shape the state of things in the future. Though, practically speaking, you'll need the support of a great deal of people to make that happen.\r\nFriedman: But, I won't bore you with any more of this. For doing so well on making it here to Kashima Shrine, I'm inviting all of you on a hot springs trip. Think of it as your New Year's gift.\r\nKaoru/Suu: Hot... \r\nHiyori/Kiyoka: ...Springs!?\r\nKaoru: Ahh... but, this is one of those things, right? I'm about to get called back on an urgent mission.\r\nFriedman: No need to worry, during this trip, you'll be completely off the clock. I've already talked it over with the presidents of each school.\r\nMirja: If you've gone to that extent, then we'll enjoy this vacation to the fullest.\r\nHirona: It's important to take breaks... I appreciate the hot springs too. It's what's most important.\r\nKaoru: ......\r\nKaoru: Oohhhhh! You planned this all out perfect, grandpa! It's so perfect I didn't know what to say for a second. Ellen, your grandpa's the best!\r\nEllen: I'm really happy you can tell how great Grandpa is, Kaoru.\r\nEllen: And then, tomorrow, we can all go again and do our first shrine visit together! I hope we'll all get along this year~! "}, {"paste_key": "1LCAZAiZ", "title": "Happy New Year!

And still, I can count the number of hours I've spent together with Yukari-sama on just one hand!!\r\nSana: But I mean like, there's nothing you can do about that, right?\r\nSana: Missions and stuff get really busy around New Year's, and Yukari-senpai's probably got a lot going on at home.\r\nYukina: Still, Hiiragi-san gets to be together with Yukari-onee-sama, doesn't she!? That's not fair!\r\nSana: Isn't that just like something you've gotta deal with?\r\nYukina: ......\r\nYukina: Why would you say that? Whose side are you on, Sana?\r\nSana: (...I'm not really on anybody's side here. I mean, like, whatever I say, I can tell this'll get really annoying.)\r\nSana: Anyway, let's forget about all that, Yukina-senpai.\r\nYukina: Forget about that?\r\nSana: Yeah. I mean, I don't really have to tell you whose side I'm on, right?\r\nSana: So like, forgetting about that... Want to do our first shrine visit or something?\r\n\r\nYukina: Would you like to go on our first shrine visit, Yukari-onee-sama!\r\nYukari: Our first shrine visit... Right now?\r\nYukina: Yes!\r\nYukina: You've been so busy for so long, so I thought you could also use a break... What do you say?\r\nYukari: Sure, a break's nice sometimes.\r\nYukina: Great!\r\nYukari: That'll be fine, right, Kagari?\r\nKagari: Yes, Yukari-sama.\r\nYukina: (Hiiragi-san!)\r\nYukina: (Now's your only chance to stay next to Yukari-onee-sama like that! On our shrine visit, I'll be with Yukari-onee-sama...!  You can just go be with Sana!)\r\nMinato: Yukari, Kagari... Wait, Yukina and Sana? Huh; what're you doing here?\r\nKagari: Sagami-san was just here inviting us to make our first shrine visit.\r\nMinato: Cool, our first shrine visit! I'll go with!\r\nYukina: (You're bringing Minato-senpai too!? Hiiragi-san! Is that how badly you want to ruin my time with Yukari-onee-sama!?)\r\nSana: (That look on her face... She's totally getting mad at Kagari-senpai for no reason.)\r\nMinato: C'mon everybody, let's go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Let's Draw Our Fortunes\r\n\r\nYukari: It figures it wouldn't be very crowded this long after New Year's. The food stalls too... I guess there won't be any.\r\nKagari: Yes; it makes it easier to stay alert of our surroundings.\r\nYukina: (Hiiragi-san, you're sticking right up next to Yukari-onee-sama! You really are trying to get in my way, aren't you!)\r\nYukina: (But, this is where Sana comes in...)\r\nMinato: Huh, so you're the one who thought of all coming to a shrine together?\r\nSana: Yep, that was me-.\r\nYukina: (Why are you off having fun chatting with Minato-senpai!? Didn't you promise to come along and help me!?)\r\nMinato: Since we came to make our first shrine visit, let's all draw our fortunes!\r\nSana: Sounds good!\r\nMinato: And whoever gets the worst fortune is buying us juice, Sana.\r\nSana: Ehh!?\r\nKagari: Gambling on your fortunes is so unscrupulous.\r\nYukari: But it does sound fun.\r\nKagari: You're bringing Yukari-sama into this too... Minato-senpai?\r\nMinato: Huh? You're mad at me?\r\nSana: What're you waiting for, Yukina-senpai? You're gonna get left behind?!\r\nYukina: Geez! Why did things end up like this!!\r\n\r\nMinato: Nice; a \"great fortune\"! What'd you get, Sana?\r\nSana: You got me beat~. Mine's just \"medium fortune\".\r\nYukari: Oh. Then, mine's the worst. See.\r\nMinato: Yukari's is a plain old \"fortune\"! What should I make you buy for me...\r\nSana: Thanks for paying!\r\nYukina: Yukari-onee-sama won't be buying you anything! Mine's \"fortune to come\"!\r\nKagari: Honestly... What are you all even doing.\r\nMinato: Well, what'd you get, Kagari?\r\nKagari: ...\"Great fortune\".\r\nMinato: Ahaha, we're the same!\r\nKagari: ...\r\nYukari: You shouldn't look so upset, getting a great fortune, Kagari... [achoo].\r\nYukari: It's gotten a little chilly, hasn't it?\r\nYukina: Yukari-onee-sama!? It'd be awful if you caught a cold! I'll go buy you something warm to drink!\r\nSana: ...I'll go too. Yukina-senpai on her own probably won't get anything for anybody besides Yukari-senpai.\r\nMinato: Then, I guess I'll go along. Won't you have a hard time carrying drinks for 4 people by yourself?\r\nSana: Thanks!\r\nYukari: It's just the two of us now.\r\nKagari: ...Right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Two of Them\r\n\r\nKagari: It's finally quieted down.\r\nKagari: We only came here to pay the shrine a visit, so we should do it without making such a commotion.\r\nYukari: ...\r\nKagari: What are you smiling for, Yukari-sama? Was there something strange about what I said?\r\nYukari: It's not like that.\r\nYukari: I was just thinking, even though you're complaining, you look like you're enjoying this.\r\nKagari: That's not......\r\nKagari: ...\r\nYukari: Is there any reason you couldn't let yourself seem more happy about it?\r\nKagari: That's... I've come to accept that a little, about myself.\r\nKagari: ...I'm letting myself be too relaxed.\r\nYukari: Huh?\r\nKagari: I've been getting too close to Minato-senpai and the others.

It's Yamashiro.\r\nYui: Things are kind of a mess right now, so I'm just leaving you a message.\r\nYui: ............\r\nYui: ...Mihono-chan... got put in confinement. They said, we won't get to see her again...\r\nYui: What should I do, Hana-san...\r\n\r\nHana: What do you mean, Mihono got put in confinement!?\r\nYui: Ah-- Hana-san...\r\nMirja: It's been some time, Suzumoto Hana. You finally came to see us.\r\nHana: Mirja-senpai... I still don't know... how I'm supposed to face all of you...\r\nHana: But still...!\r\nHana: I heard that Mihono got put in confinement... Does it have to do with that great aradama!?\r\nMirja: ...Did Yamashiro Yui tell you about that?\r\nYui: ...I'm sorry. I felt like, I should let Hana-san know...\r\nMirja: I don't mean to criticize you for it.\r\nMirja: ...It makes this conversation quicker. Asakura Mihono is in a state where there's no telling when the great aradama's power will run rampant.\r\nMirja: You understand the danger of the situation... don't you?\r\nHana: I do...\r\nMirja: When Asakura Mihono lost control of the great aradama's power, it was decided that she would be put in confinement.\r\nHana: She lost control!? How's Mihono doing!?\r\nMirja: ...She's fine, for now.\r\nHana: Thank goodness...\r\nHana: ...? By the way, where's the rest of the investigation team?\r\nMirja: Ban Tsugumi is at her research lab.\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki and Musumi Kiyoka... went to the Ministry of Defense. Setouchi Chie joined them, to make sure they didn't do anything unreasonable.\r\nMirja: ...Though, as I see it, Setouchi Chie herself is the one most likely to be unreasonable...\r\nHana: The Ministry of Defense?\r\nMirja: Do you remember the facility where Takirihime was held in custody?\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono has been quarantined in that same facility.\r\nHana: ...Alright. I'm going to the Ministry of Defense too.\r\nMirja: There's no point in going.\r\nHana: Huh?\r\nMirja: ...We're forbidden from meeting with her. The three of them know they can't see her... but I suppose they couldn't wait here.\r\nHana: But, then... Mihono...\r\nMirja: We can't leave here unattended, so the two of us remained behind...\r\nYui: ...To be honest, we don't know what to do. I went along with Kiyoka-chan and them at first, but they wouldn't listen to anything we said.\r\nHana: ......!\r\nHana: Let's see Mihono.\r\nYui: If they'd let anybody in, we would... but...\r\nHana: The investigation team can do it. The team's attached to the Origami family now, isn't it?\r\nYui: Ah!\r\nMirja: ......\r\nMirja: I had considered that possibility myself, but...\r\nHana: It might be mixing up private and official matters pretty badly... but that's not what matters most right now.\r\nHana: Let's go and see Mihono!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Visit (1)\r\n\r\nMirja: Thank you very much for hearing out our unreasonable request, Origami Yukari-sama.\r\nYukari: I was concerned for Asakura as well.\r\nYukari: Though... This is likely the first and last meeting we'll get. I can't keep making this happen.\r\nChie: I understand.\r\nYukari: ...Let's go.\r\n\r\nKanami: Huh? The investigation team's here?\r\nKofuki: What're you two doing here?\r\nHiyori: ...It's our assignment.\r\nYukari: We had the two of them stationed here. There aren't many toji who would be able to respond to Asakura when she loses control.\r\nKiyoka: Then, you two get to see Hono-chan...\r\nKanami: ...No, we don't get to visit her either.\r\nHiyori: The only time we'd get to see her... is when we have to stop her from rampaging.\r\nKiyoka: But then... does that mean, you're only here for if you have to cut down Hono-chan...?\r\nHiyori: ...... So, why are you...\r\nHiyori: ...Oh, you came to see Mihono.\r\nKanami: Good...\r\nKanami: Ever since Mihono-chan got locked up here, she probably hasn't gotten to see anybody...\r\nHana: Is there anything... you want us to tell Mihono for you?\r\nKanami: ...Just tell her, I'm sorry.\r\nHana: Eh?\r\nKanami: Sorry, that I couldn't do anything for her...\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nChie: We all... feel the same way... None of us could do anything...\r\nYui: Chie-san...\r\nHana: I'll make sure... she knows.\r\nHiyori: ...Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Visit (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Ah... Chii-nee... Guys...\r\nKofuki: Dang, Mihocchi. Haven't you been doing enough crying lately?\r\nMihono: But... they said... I'd never get to see anybody again...\r\nChie: I know... I know...!\r\nYui: This is too horrible! She's going to get all messed up, locked up in here by herself!\r\nMirja: Is there any hope of improving her conditions, Origami Yukari-sama?\r\nYukari: I could arrange for a better environment... but anything more would be difficult.\r\nYukari: ...Asakura. What have they told you, in regards to your treatment?\r\nMihono: They said, I can't ever leave here again... that it was for the good of the world...\r\nYui: Huh!? Losing Mihono-chan is way worse for the world!\r\nKiyoka: If we could do something about Kanayamahime... then, could Hono-chan leave here?\r\nYukari: If the great aradama within Asakura could be suppressed or fully sealed... it could happen.\r\nMirja: But... with what we have now, that would be effectively impossible...\r\nTsugumi: ...Then there's nothing else we can do. I'm going to pay a visit to Hitakami-san.\r\nChie: Tsugumi-chan!?\r\nTsugumi: Hitakami-san is currently the one with the most information on Kanayamahime.\r\nKofuki: Yeah... maybe that's a good idea.\r\nKiyoka: Kofuki-san! We don't need help from the kind of people who'd do those experiments! Let's save Hono-chan ourselves!\r\nKofuki: The whole reason this happened is cause we can't do that!\r\nKiyoka: That doesn't mean...\r\nMihono: Don't fight!\r\nKiyoka/Kofuki: ...\r\nMihono: I don't want to have to see you guys fighting...\r\nMihono: I'm fine, with staying here like this, so...\r\nChie: Mihono-chan...? What are you saying...?\r\nMihono: This whole time... I've been thinking by myself. Why all this had to happen.\r\nMihono: ...But, instead of being swallowed up by Kanayamahime, it'd be better if I just stayed locked up here...\r\nHana: ...I can't stand seeing you that weak, Mihono.\r\nMihono: Hana?\r\nHana: ...It's been a while.\r\nHana: I'm sorry... for not being there when you were going through so much.\r\nMihono: It's fine... I'm just glad you came to see me. I really am...\r\nYui: Hana-san's the one who came up with this, Mihono-chan. How, if we asked Yukari-sama, we could get special permission to see you.\r\nHana: We just used how the investigation team is working for the Origami family. We did have to bend the rules for it.\r\nHana: But, it was the right thing to do.\r\nHana: ...Don't try to sacrifice yourself, Mihono. Nobody wants you to do that.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nHana: You always looked best when you're saving somebody else... Whenever you're holding up your okatana as a toji.\r\nHana: Way better than wallowing in self-sacrifice in this place.\r\nHana: So... don't give up here. If the investigation team didn't have you... I couldn't take it.\r\nMihono: Hana...\r\nHana: All of us are wanting you to come back. Nobody thinks it'd be better if you stayed here, okay?\r\nHanae: That goes for Kanami-san and Hiyori-san too.\r\nMihono: Kanami and Juujou-san?\r\nYui: They're both right outside.\r\nYui: And, they're really depressed they couldn't do anything for you.\r\nYui: I'm sure everybody else feels the same way!\r\nMihono: ......\r\nChie: So please, don't give up now... We want to have more time with you...\r\nMihono: I mean... I want that too...\r\nMihono: Is it okay... if I still keep hoping for that...? Can I still... keep wanting to be with you...?\r\nChie: You shouldn't have to ask...\r\nMihono: Chii-nee... I want to get out of here... Help me...\r\nChie: I know... I will...!"}, {"paste_key": "KubvY7Yj", "title": "Misogi Mirja", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/KubvY7Yj", "timestamp": "", "hits": "63", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/iRrAMU80Nt0\r\n[Misogi - Mirja: Start]: Fix Eyes on the Sword\r\n\r\nMirja: (This happened when I was still part of Ayanokouji Martial Arts School's middle school division-- That is to say, several years ago.)\r\nMirja: (As my grandfather and father, both swordsmiths, shared with me their skills in polishing swords, I polished one Akabane sword.)\r\nMirja: (What I honed then is the okatana I have with me now: Jikkyuu Mitsutada.)\r\nMirja: (I was taken down the path of a toji because of the compatibility I showed with an okatana I myself restored. I'm still proud of that to this day.)\r\n\r\nMirja: HAAAH!\r\nSenpai Toji: ...Wha-!? Y-You got me...!\r\nMirja: Thank you very much for joining me here.\r\nSenpai Toji: Mann, you're seriously strong, Kitora. No wonder you got picked to represent us at the tournament.\r\nSenpai Toji: I won't be able to go and cheer you on, but give it your best shot there.\r\nMirja: I will. As one of the selected representatives, I plan to do my best not to dishonor Ayanokouji's reputation.\r\nSenpai Toji: Fufu, you're sure taking this seriously.\r\n\r\nMirja: (Then, in the preliminary round, came my match against Shidou Maki. Even now, I can remember that moment vividly.)\r\n\r\nMaki: HAAAAAAAAAAHH!\r\nMirja: ...Gggh!\r\nReferee: That's enough! The winner: Heijou Academy's Shidou Maki.\r\nMirja: (Then, I wasn't good enough to reach the finals? Her swordsmanship, it was so straightforward. Each and every strike, so strong, so heavy, so much more than I could handle...)\r\nMirja: ...\r\nMirja: (Shidou Maki... I understood that there would always be someone better, but... All I can do is make use of this to train myself up again.)\r\n\r\nMirja: ......\r\nAradama: GGGGIIii...!\r\nSenpai Toji: Kitora! The aradama's headed your way!\r\nMirja: ...!?\r\nMirja: (...Was I really that absent minded during a mission?)\r\nMirja: Understood... I'll deal with it now!\r\nMirja: I won't let it escape! --HAAAAAAH!!\r\nMirja: What about the other aradama?\r\nSenpai Toji: The one you got now was the last of them.\r\nMirja: It was? Then, we need to recover the noro. I'll help you.\r\nKouhai Toji: Kitora-senpai... Did something happen to her?\r\nSenpai Toji: Hmm... Ever since the tournament, it's like her head's up in the clouds sometimes... I'm a little worried about her.\r\n\r\nMirja: ......\r\nMirja: (As always... being alone performing maintenance on an okatana gives me the best chance to examine myself.)\r\nMirja: (I'm only mindlessly working my hands, and yet Jikkyu Mitsutada is showing me things I wouldn't ordinarily notice... That's the feeling I get.)\r\nMirja: Still, to make both my senpai and kouhai worried... How pathetic of me.\r\nMirja: It seems that... It's strange to admit, but losing to Shidou Maki must have been somewhat of a shock to me... I think.\r\nMirja: I wasn't conceited, but challenging her with everything I had and losing is frustrating... Faced with her sword, I was shown the true extent of her strength. And, that might not be something I can reach with just my swordsmanship.\r\nMirja: It's not that I have any intention of neglecting my training, but...\r\nMirja: As a toji, what sort of path should I explore from here?\r\nMirja: ...Heh. Jikkyuu Mitsutada isn't going to tell me that much, is it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Misogi - Mirja: Start]: What Must Be Polished is You Yourself\r\n\r\nMirja: We'll be in trouble if it comes out from blind spots behind the trees!\r\nMirja: Let's move out into the open and engage from there. Fortunately, the aradama appears to be pursuing us.\r\nMirja: (I won't show as shameful a performance as last time. I'm focused.)\r\nSenpai Toji: I'm not happy about that one bit though...\r\nSenpai Toji: But, it'll be easier fighting like Kitora said. Let's go!\r\nAradama: ......!\r\nMirja: It's moving as anticipated. Now, let's make our move.\r\nKouhai Toji: U-Um! Is it really alright for me to be the one finishing it off...?\r\nKouhai Toji: I think one of you senpais should do it.\r\nMirja: No, the two of us will halt its movements. At that point, please come at it from behind.\r\nMirja: If you're unable to bring it down, we'll immediately go on the attack.\r\nSenpai Toji: The way things are, that seems like the least risky way to beat it.\r\nKouhai Toji: Alright then...!\r\nMirja: Have confidence in yourself. --Here it comes!\r\nAradama: SHAAaaaa...!\r\n\r\nMirja: I'm sorry to have made the both of you worry about me on our last mission.\r\nSenpai Toji: It's all good. You were more clear headed than usual today anyway. It helped see the fight from a different perspective.\r\nSenpai Toji: Some girls get so focused on the fighting they lose sight of what's around them.\r\nKouhai Toji: I also had a valuable experience here thanks to you, Kitora-senpai! I feel a little more confident now.\r\nMirja: It's all because I had your cooperation. A toji's duty is to exorcise aradama and protect the people. Toji should combine their strengths.\r\nMirja: I recognized that once again here.\r\nMirja: (I don't necessarily need to bring about overwhelming results with my swordsmanship. What's important is that we accomplish our duties more safely.)\r\nMirja: (Studying more into tactics for battle and managing a unit will surely be useful to me.)\r\nSenpai Toji: You look kinda like you got a weight off your shoulders there, Kitora.\r\nMirja: Yes; because I've found a direction to go in.\r\n\r\nMirja: (When I participated in the tournament in my third year of middle school... and, the missions that came shortly after. I believe it was a good opportunity for me.)\r\nUraga Nao: Hey, Mirja~? You listening~?\r\nMirja: I am listening. As you two groan on about your post-high school graduation career paths.\r\nNao: They make it sound like checking our career paths is no big deal, but this is tough~. They tell you to write down schools of choice too, if you're going on to university.\r\nMizushina Kinuka: Ah! Maybe I should write down Ayanokouji Martial Arts School as my school of choice. The best way to keep an eye on my little sister would be to get re-enrolled here-.\r\nMirja: The teacher is going to think you're making a joke. And, how would your sister feel, having her older sister as her kouhai now?\r\nKinuka: She'd be delighted, wouldn't she!\r\nMirja: Sigh... You too, Uraga Nao; why not work backwards and narrow down which faculty to pursue from your future dreams and goals?\r\nNao: Ughh... I don't want to hear you using logic on me now. What about you, Mirja? Are you already thinking about your career path and everything~?\r\nMirja: I'm thinking of becoming an okatana polisher, once I lose my powers as a toji. Though, it's only one possibility.\r\nKinuka: Your family are swordsmiths... they're polishers, right? And can't you do it yourself too, Kitora-san?\r\nMirja: I can. Even now, I keep in practice enough to not lose my skill. When I want to think something over, I feel like doing it while polishing an okatana.\r\nMirja: Of course, I also check with professionals from time to time.\r\nNao: Mirja, you're totally okatana crazy~.\r\nKinuka: Well, that's nothing new.\r\nMirja: I would like to continue polishing Akabane swords in the future.\r\nMirja: By polishing and restoring Akabane swords, it might lead to a rise in the number of toji accepted by okatana. That's something I want to help with.\r\nNao: Oh gosh... she has such a serious and well defined goal~...\r\nKinuka: That sounds like something the teachers would take, no questions asked. But, wait, why have you been thinking this out more than us third years-!?\r\nMirja: ...That's something I should be asking, as your kouhai.

For now, there isn't anything...

So you don't have to worry about it too much.\r\nChie: And a lot of the time, suppressing aradama is part of collecting Akabane swords, so as long as you stay focused like you would on your normal missions, you won't have any problems.\r\nHirona: I see-...\r\nKiyoka: Um... Chie-san, it's about time.\r\nChie: You're right. Okay, Mihono-chan. I'm leaving the rest to you. We have to hurry and get ready.\r\nMihono: Ah, sure!

That's our job here done. It might not be so easy for us to work together at first, but let's keep at it, Nitta-san.\r\nHirona: The investigation team coordinates surprisingly well. Even without clear signals, everyone moves so naturally...\r\nYui: We do have the cool and sexy Mirja-san commanding us! And the investigation team goes on tons of missions together!\r\nYui: Besides, you're part of the team now too. So, let's get to know each other really well so we get coordinated, Hirona-chan!\r\nHirona: Okay...\r\nKiyoka: Uhh, um... You don't have to go along with Yui-chan until you're used to dealing with her.\r\nYui: Don't be like that-, Kiyoka-chaaan. You know I love you too-.\r\nMihono: You're really strong, Hirona! I panicked after that aradama came after you before, but you're like super fast!\r\nHirona: I'm not that great... When you saved me from that aradama, you seemed so much stronger to me. I can't explain it well though...\r\nMihono: No way; you were all like... Whoosh woosh woosh! And it was so cool how you moved your sword, Hirona!\r\nMihono: Ah. I just started calling you Hirona; are you okay with that? We're in the same grade, so you should just call me Mihono too!\r\nHirona: Go ahead... Then... I'll call you Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: Don't you mean Mihono!? Well, you can say whatever's easier for you-.\r\nChie: I was a little worried at first, but it looks like things should be fine.\r\nMirja: I know. I'm glad to see it. The team can operate even more safely now.\r\nKofuki: This sucks... I'm gonna get even less aradama-chan to pick from now.\r\nMirja: Considering the skills she's shown, that's likely the case.\r\nKofuki: But, that doesn't mean I'm giving any up without a fight!\r\nChie: Okay, when we get back, how about we give Hirona-chan her welcoming party?\r\nKiyoka/Mihono/Yui: Yeah-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Nitta Hirona's Reasons\r\n\r\nHirona: Thank you... for going this far for me.\r\nChie: We'd actually been meaning to cook something up to welcome you, but we couldn't find the time. Though, the cakes here are delicious, aren't they?\r\nHirona: Yes... They are. I do like sweets a lot. Moving your body and using your head requires sugar... so it's very cost efficient.\r\nKofuki: That's just normal. It'd be weirder if you were like somebody who doesn't care what stuff tastes like as long as it's got nutrition.\r\nHirona: ...? Do you know someone like that? You can't not eat food, so... I think it's better for it to taste good.\r\nMihono: That's for sure. This cake's yummy, but I wish we could've eaten Chii-nee's cooking too... She's a really good cook~.\r\nHirona: Is she-? My senpai is great at cooking too-.\r\nHirona: Of course, I would like to try Setouchi-san's cooking too... someday.\r\nChie: It doesn't have to be someday; we can do it soon. Do you cook, Nitta-san?\r\nHirona: If I use a microwave or rice cooker... I can cook some things. There's lots of recipes you can use a rice cooker for nowadayys...\r\nHirona: But... I've been eating out and getting food from convenience stores more lately. If you think about the time required, it's very efficient...\r\nChie: If you want to eat healthy, it's better to cook for yourself, but we do get lots of missions, don't we.\r\nMirja: Come to think of it, have the two of you ever met at Osafune, or been assigned on the same mission?\r\nChie: I don't think we have. Have we?\r\nHirona: No... I don't think I've ever been in the same team as Setouchi-san...\r\nKiyoka: Speaking of Osafune, that uniform... Nitta-san... it suits you really well.\r\nHirona: ...You think so? I can't really tell... But, since having a uniform means I don't need to think about what to wear, I like having onee. So much that I sometimes wear it on days off too.\r\nHirona: In a way... uniforms are the most powerful clothes.\r\nKiyoka: Uniforms are cute, but that's such a waste! You should come try on clothes with us sometime, Nitta-san.\r\nHirona: Still... I can order online.\r\nKiyoka: It's so much better buying clothes in person though! And it's really fun!\r\nMihono: Let's go do it!\r\nHirona: Alright thenn...\r\nHirona: (With personal relationships... slow and steady is best... and this is the investigation team...)\r\nYui: Mmm~, I can't wait-! It doesn't get better than having more cuties around!\r\n\r\nSeveral hours later--\r\n\r\nYuuki: Yuuki here. How's everything going over there? Please give your report.\r\nHirona: Thenn... to start with... there's a very high chance Asakura-san's power is what Makoto-san thinks.

By what?\r\nHirona: I thought I'd be giving my report to Akira-san.\r\nYuuki: Oh, Akira-nee-sama said this was practice making contact and getting reports. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. She said, \"Don't stand out too much.\"\r\nHirona: Okaay, keeping quiet is what I'm good at... Hurray for energy efficiency.\r\nYuuki: Alright then; do your best out there, Hirona-san! Akira-nee-sama and Makoto-nee-sama have high hopes for you!\r\nHirona: ...What about you, Yuuki-saan?\r\nYuuki: Well, sure I am. If I had to put it like Akira-nee-sama, it's hardcore. I have hardcore hopes for you!\r\nHirona: Hardcore-? Fufu...... I'll try my beest.\r\nYuuki: If anything else comes up, let us know, okay? I'm about to go to bed...

Somebody, swap with me!!)\r\nMihono: It's been a while since we got a mission together, huh, Akira-san!\r\nAkira: Definitely. I'm gonna be looking to see how much you've grown.\r\nMihono: Sure thing!\r\nKiyoka: (Hono-chan looks like she's enjoying this... There's some things I want to go over with her, but... I think I'll save it for later.)\r\nKiyoka: I'm looking forward to working with you, Sanae-san.\r\nSanae: Mm, I'm looking forward to working with you too, Musumi-san.\r\nSuu: (Come to think of it, Kiyoka-san and Iwakura-san are from Heijou... So then, since Hokuto-san's from Heijou too, why didn't they pick her instead of me?)\r\nMihono: You look like something's bothering you, Inami-san? Did you get a tummyache?\r\nSuu: Ah, I'm fine. Just thinking about something...\r\nAkira: Nn? And you're...\r\nSuu: I'm just your average a little bit weaker than most toji you could find anywhere; don't mind me!\r\nMihono: Uwah!? What're you shouting for all of a sudden, Inami-san?\r\nAkira: Inami, huh. What's your first name?\r\nSuu: It's Suu... But, um, you don't have to go out of your way to remember it or anything...\r\nAkira: You don't have to be such a downer; we're on the same team together! Glad to have ya, Suu.\r\nSuu: (She remembered my nameeeeeeeeeeeeee!!)\r\nSuu: Um... Mihono-san... About Inago-san, is she... a delinquent?\r\nMihono: No way!

With that settled, I'll leave the rest to you.\r\nSanae: Could I ask one question, Konohana-san? Who will be the leader of this group?\r\nSuzuka: I wasn't given instructions on that. Please decide that amongst yourselves and report back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Ceremonial Guard (2)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, I wanted to talk to you about... Oh, she's not here?\r\nKanami: Huh, Musumi-san? If you're looking for Mihono-chan, as soon as school was over, she ran off somewhere. Did you need her for something?\r\nKiyoka: Mm-mm, it's alright.

Inago-san and Inami-san don't seem to be around either.\r\nKiyoka: ...\r\nSanae: I'm not sure where Inago-san and the others went to, but I don't think those three will get into any trouble, so let's wait a bit and see.\r\nKiyoka: ...Okay.\r\n\r\nSeveral days later.\r\n\r\nSanae: So those three went off somewhere again today...\r\nKiyoka: ...They did.

I haven't been doing anything... It sort of makes me really embarrassed.\r\nSanae: ...I get what you mean.

That's right, if you could get it for the last five years or so.\r\nKiyoka: (Drawing up plans for the day of... predicting the traffic conditions, securing travel routes, identifying places that could likely be blind spots...)\r\nKiyoka: Phew, there's so much to take care of, isn't there.\r\nSanae: ...Yeah; it might be a little too much for just the two of us after all.\r\nSuu: We'll help you out with that!\r\nSanae: Inami-san, Inago-san, Asakura-san? Weren't you out training...?\r\nSuu: We heard people saying you two had been looking for us, so we hurried over!\r\nSuu: We weren't at all thinking anything like, yay, a break from how harsh Inago-san is or anything!?\r\nAkira: Geez, look at the nerve she's got.\r\nMihono: Ahaha, sorry, Kiyoka. We weren't doing anything besides training... You had to do everything else for us, didn't you.\r\nAkira: Nah, I'm the one to blame here.\r\nAkira: I asked these two to cover me so I wouldn't show up late on Christmas. And, as a tradeoff, I was helping them with training.\r\nAkira: I figured we'd be fine since Sanae's the leader, so I ended up leaving everything to you.\r\nSanae: Eh? Aren't you the leader, Inago-san?\r\nAkira: What're you talking about? Any way you look at it, it's gotta be you. I'm not really the leader type.\r\nSanae: ...Alright then. I'll give it my best shot.\r\nAkira: That's that; anybody against it?\r\nEveryone: Nope!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Ceremonial Guard (5)\r\n\r\nMihono: Ahh... It's cold!\r\nSuu: With how cold it is, I'm scared of getting hurt, so maybe we could cancel training...?\r\nKiyoka: Ahaha, I don't think that's going to happen... Oh? Hono-chan, there's a hole in your glove?\r\nMihono: I know, Kiyoka~. Akira-san's training was so rough that it got torn up~.\r\nKiyoka: (It's almost Christmas, so I could get Hono-chan a present...)\r\nKiyoka: ......Ah!\r\nMihono: Did you think of something, Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: Our security mission is on Christmas, right? So, when we're finished, we could celebrate that and have a Christmas party...\r\nMihono: That'd totally be fun! Nice idea, Kiyoka!\r\nSuu: And, you know, if I have a Christmas party to look forward to, I feel like I can try harder with Inago-san's training... maybe?\r\nKiyoka: Alright then! Let's go pass the idea on to the others!\r\n\r\nOn a day off.\r\n\r\nMihono: So anyway, we're here to buy presents for the present exchange-!\r\nKiyoka/Suu: [clap clap clap]~!\r\nMihono: I'm glad Akira-san and Iwakura-san both said they're excited to do it. Did you two already decide on what you're buying?\r\nSuu: I actually have two things in mind... Garden or Hell Angel Marvelous-chan; which one do you think I should try and make more fans of!?\r\nMihono: Wh-Which one... What are you gonna do if they go to Akira-san?\r\nSuu: If Inago-san got those...\r\nSuu: ......\r\nSuu: Ah...... I think, I might die... I'll buy something safe, like aroma oil...\r\nMihono: Aroma oil, huh. Then, I'll get...\r\nCake Shop: We're accepting reservations for Christmas cakes here-.\r\nMihono: Christmas cakes... All creamy... Okay, I'll go with moisturizer cream!\r\nKiyoka: Ahaha, only you would make up your mind like that, Hono-chan. For mine... Since it's Christmas, I think I'll get a snowglobe.\r\nMihono: Then, let's all split up and buy our stuff!\r\n\r\nShopkeeper: Thank you very much~.\r\nKiyoka: Okay, I got a cute one. All that's left is...\r\nKiyoka: (Gloves for Hono-chan! I'll sneak over and buy her some!)\r\nKiyoka: (Fufu, how happy will Hono-chan be when she gets them?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Ceremonial Guard (6)\r\n\r\nSanae: Inago-san and the others sure are late...\r\nKiyoka: They are...\r\nKiyoka: I got a message from Hono-chan saying they were on their way a long time ago too...\r\nMihono: Kiyoka-! Iwakura-saaan! S-Sorry we're late-!\r\nAkira: Phew, we just barely made it in time!\r\nSuu: Th-That was close...\r\nSanae: Did you run into trouble?\r\nAkira: Nah, nothing like that happened today, so it's all good. It's cause I had Mihono and Suu with me.\r\nMihono: Eh!?\r\nMihono: (All that stuff happened, and she doesn't call that trouble...?)\r\nSuu: (I'm never going to wake Inago-san up, no way!)\r\nSanae: ...So anyway, let's split into two teams like we planned and start our guard duty!\r\n\r\nMihono: Hey, Kiyoka, Inami-san.\r\nKiyoka: What is it?\r\nMihono: The person who just went in, I feel like I've seen them somewhere before... Do you know who that is?\r\nSuu: Aren't they some politician?\r\nKiyoka: I'm not all that familiar either, but I'm pretty sure they're... a high ranking government official.\r\nMihono: Ah, it's Friedman-san!\r\nMihono: ...He walked right by.\r\nKiyoka: It's understandable; he probably doesn't have time to stop and chat with us.\r\nSuu: ...The party should be starting around now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Ceremonial Guard (7)\r\n\r\nOperator: ...a suspicious person has been sighted. Please head there at once.\r\nSecurity Officer: Understood.\r\nMihono: Ever since the party started, there's reports of suspicious people one after another.\r\nKiyoka: With all these important people here, it's bound to happen.\r\nMihono: Is it okay for us to not be doing anything about it?\r\nKiyoka: The security officers will deal with anyone suspicious. Our job is just to take care of if aradama appear.\r\nSuu: Ehh!? Then, that training we did, and our special training... There wasn't any point to Inago-san hazing us, was there!?\r\nKiyoka: That's not true! If we have to go fight an aradama, that special training will be worth it!\r\nOperator: An appearance of aradama has been confirmed in the area of the academy. Will Iwakura team please head to suppress it at once.\r\nMihono: There's aradama!\r\nSanae: Musumi-san, Asakura-san, Inami-san. The place where the aradama appeared is closer to you three! I need you to suppress it!\r\nAll Three: Right!\r\n\r\nMihono: Uwah--!? There's so many cars here!!\r\nSuu: It'll be tough making it down this road.\r\nKiyoka: It's alright! I made sure to look things up for times like this!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, Inami-san! Over here!\r\n\r\nMihono: Ah, there's not a lot of traffic this way!\r\nKiyoka: While you three were training hard, I was preparing as best I could too!\r\nMihono: Nice going, Kiyoka!\r\n\r\nAradama: GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nKiyoka: ...There it is!\r\nMihono: Inami-san, let's do it just like we trained!\r\nSuu: Sure! Mihono-san!\r\nMihono/Suu: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nAradama: GYAA...\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, Inami-san, that was great! You were perfectly coordinated!\r\nMihono: Eheh! That's the combo that worked on Akira-san, after all!\r\nMihono: Let's keep it up like this!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Ceremonial Guard (8)\r\n\r\nSanae: Now then... Great work on our guard duty! Let's start our celebration and Christmas party!\r\nAkira: Cool, it's time to swap presents! I got a special one ready, so look forward to it.\r\nMihono: I did my best to get something nice too, Akira-san!\r\nSanae: It's exciting waiting to see whose present you'll get, isn't it?\r\nKiyoka: It really is!\r\n\r\nSanae: Okay, now why don't we open the presents we're all holding?\r\nAkira: Mine's... Aroma oil?\r\nSuu: Ah, that's the present I picked out!\r\nAkira: Huh, thanks, Suu!\r\nSuu: (That was close... Thank god I didn't go with fan merch!)\r\nSuu: Mine's moisturizer cream, so... Wasn't that from Mihono-san?\r\nMihono: I made sure to get some that smelled good! I'll open mine next! Oh, it's a handkerchief!\r\nSanae: Ah, that's the present I chose. I tried to go with something that wouldn't trouble anybody...\r\nMihono: It's really cute, Iwakura-san!\r\nSanae: Thank goodness. My one is... It's a snowglobe. How adorable... Was this from you, Musumi-san?\r\nKiyoka: Yep. Since it's Christmas and all, I went with a snowglobe.\r\nAkira: So, that means Kiyoka must've got mine. Go and open it.\r\nKiyoka: Okay. This is... a helmet?\r\nAkira: Sure! I'll give you a ride later on, after I can!\r\nMihono: You're so lucky, Kiyoka! Akira-san, you have to let me ride with you too!\r\nAkira: Course I will!\r\nMihono: Cool!\r\nKiyoka: ...Hono-chan.\r\nMihono: Huh? What is it, Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: ...Could we talk outside for a minute?\r\n\r\nMihono: Ughh, it's cold! What'd you need to bring me out here for, Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: ...Here's a present for you, Hono-chan. They're new gloves. I'd be glad if you used them.\r\nMihono: Thanks, Kiyoka! You know... I got a present for you too!\r\nKiyoka: Eh!? This is... a bookmark?\r\nMihono: I know you like books, so. Though, I was worried this one was a little too cheap.\r\nKiyoka: I don't think it's cheap at all. I'm very happy with it...

I'm pretty sure Hono-chan bought it, right?\r\nMihono: Yeah! It was from this meat shop I stumbled across.\r\nMihono: It smelled so good walking past the store, so I tried some croquettes, and they were really yummy! So I decided to get chicken from there.\r\nMihono: Their croquettes, meatcakes, ham cutlets... They all tasted good.\r\nMihono: The meatcakes were so juicy, and the ham cutlets were really thick!\r\nKofuki: [gulp] Just hearing you talk about them's making me hungry... Wait, hold up. I don't remember eating any croquettes?\r\nMihono: Cause I didn't buy any.\r\nMihono: I mean, wouldn't croquettes for Christmas be weird?\r\nKofuki: If they're tasty, then buy 'em too!\r\nMihono: Well I got us chicken, didn't I!\r\nChie: Okay, that's enough, you two.\r\nChie: Is everyone alright with having Mihono-chan get us chicken again this year?\r\nKofuki: No complaints here!

After that, you...\r\nMakoto: I won't deny that it's one of the causes.\r\nMakoto: I simply... don't want there to be any more toji like Miyako-san.\r\nMakoto: I don't anyone else to experience the things we have...\r\nChie: ......\r\nChie: I understand that feeling. But still, I'm against you using noro for that.\r\nMakoto: I wouldn't stop no matter who's against me.\r\nMakoto: When Inago and Toribane... became tamayori toji in my place, I resolved to that.\r\n\r\nEllen: We're not going to be convincing her.

Didn't Chichie get kidnapped?\r\nKiyoka: I'm not sure, but... this all feels weird, doesn't it?\r\n???: Don't let Asakura Mihono get away!\r\nAkira: ...Figures.\r\nAkira: What the hell are you going off starting on your own!?\r\n???: Asakura Mihono is the one who came to attack us.\r\nAkira: Cause you went and baited her, right? Or... Not you, but the group of heads backing you.\r\nHitakami Faction Head Group Toji: ...We followed our own judgment. If you're going to get between us... We won't have a choice.\r\nHitakami Faction Head Group Toji: You're up! Bring down Inago-san with them if you have to!\r\nTamayori Toji: ...\r\nAkira: What're you in that for...\r\nTamayori Toji: I was only able to become a proper tamayori toji like this thanks to you, Inago-san.\r\nAkira: \"Proper\"?\r\nAkira: Get the fuck out of here! Nobody besides me and Yuuki can get the noro off of them!\r\nTamayori Toji: I'm prepared for whatever comes. Regardless, I believe this is what's necessary for the future of toji.\r\nAkira: You goddamn idiots! Mihono!\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah!?\r\nAkira: I'm backing you up!\r\nAkira: I'm gonna smash their faces in, till they never think of doing something this stupid again!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/sghc0m\r\n14: The Scheme's Consequence (1)\r\n\r\nTamayori Toji: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nMihono: Kgh...!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, stay behind me!\r\nMihono: O-Okay!\r\nMirja: ...A tamayori toji with their consciousness intact is that much more troublesome than the one we faced before.\r\nKofuki: It's not like we can ignore the other ones either; what do we do, Mirja!?\r\nMirja: Do not fight the tamayori toji head on! Move to create an opening!\r\nYui: That's easy to say, but, like this...!\r\nHitakami Faction Head Group Toji: YAAAAAH!\r\nYui: Uwah!?\r\nAkira: Don't you touch Yui, asshole!\r\nHitakami Faction Head Group Toji: Urgh...\r\nAkira: You alright, Yui!?\r\nYui: Th-Thanks a lot, Boss!\r\nYui: Or, wait, Boss! Can't you become a tamayori toji too!? Wouldn't that make this way easier!\r\nAkira: No can do! I haven't got noro on me now!\r\nMihono: (Everybody's struggling... If I had some way to use Kanayamahime's power without going berserk...)\r\nMihono: ...Rrgh!?\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan!?\r\nMihono: But, ghh...\r\nAkira: Is she losing control!? You can't, Mihono! You've gotta...!\r\nMihono: AAAAAAAARRRGGGHHHHHH!!\r\nChie: Everyone! ...Mihono-chan!?\r\nMihono: ......\r\nChie: No... Mihono-chan! Hey, can you hear me!?\r\nEllen: ...Chie.\r\nEllen: ...We have to stop Mihomiho's from rampaging before we can do anything.\r\nEllen: Kaoru told me all she had to do was cut through her utsushi...\r\nAkira: That's right...\r\nHitakami Faction Head Group Toji: We did it! We actually did it! Now, we can...\r\nAkira: You think this is the time for that!?\r\nHitakami Faction Head Group Toji: Ugh...\r\nMakoto: Akira-chan!\r\nAkira: ...I'm sorry. I couldn't stop things from going to shit.\r\nMakoto: ...It's not your fault.\r\nChie: Makoto! Is this what you wanted!?\r\nMakoto: ...Right now, we need to take care of Asakura-san...\r\nChie: I don't need you to tell me that...! I'll be the one to bring Mihono-chan back!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/2j4oj7\r\n15: The Scheme's Consequence (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Mihono-chan! Please, just go back to normal...!!\r\nMihono: Rrgh!\r\nMihono: ...\r\nChie: ......\r\nHitakami Faction Head Group Toji: Go now; capture Asakura Mihono!\r\nMakoto: You mustn't let them have Asakura-san!\r\nKofuki: Like you have to say it!\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie, take care of Asakura Mihono! Musumi Kiyoka, Yamashiro Yui, protect Setouchi Chie!\r\nChie: I'm on it! Cover us, you two!\r\nKiyoka/Yui: Right!\r\nAkira: These are...

Is that clear?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: A Request\r\n\r\nAkane: I'm sorry to call you here on such short notice.\r\nKanami: That doesn't matter; is it true Mihono-chan went berserk!?\r\nAkane: ...It's the truth.\r\nHiyori: Did Kanayamahime wake up?\r\nAkane: ...Not yet.\r\nKanami: What made all this happen...\r\nAkane: The heads of the Hitakami faction acted out of control.\r\nHiyori: Their faction's infighting now...!? Don't drag Mihono into something so stupid...!\r\nAkane: ...\r\nAkane: Asakura-san will be placed in confinement at a Ministry of Defense facility. And, that's where...

Engaging suppression of aradama! Asakura Mihono!\r\nMihono: Here!\r\nMirja: I know you're still not accustomed to this, but please act as our operator!\r\nMihono: You can leave it to me, Mirja-san!\r\nKiyoka: You'll see, Hono-chan. We'll do all we can so you won't have to worry about us.\r\nMihono: ...Yeah, do your best, Kiyoka.\r\nKofuki: I like it better with you gone, Mihocchi. I get way more aradama to play with this way!\r\nMihono: Isn't that kinda rude, Fukki...?\r\nYui: Ahaha.\r\nChie: Alright, that's enough.\r\nChie: Everyone, let's stay focused on what we have to do!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Investigation Team Without Mihono (2)\r\n\r\nMirja: Kh, these are difficult opponents...\r\nKofuki: What's wrong with that! That just makes 'em more fun to fool around with!\r\nChie: Kiyoka-chan! Yui-chan! Please back me up!\r\nKiyoka/Yui: Okay!\r\n\r\nMihono: Guys...\r\nTsugumi: They're having a bit of trouble today.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nTsugumi: ...The investigation team should be able to handle themselves though.\r\nTsugumi: Would you like some hot milk? It would help you to relax.\r\nMihono: ...Ah, sure.\r\nTsugumi: I'll get it ready.\r\nMihono: ............\r\nMihono: So being an operator was this nerve-wracking... I never knew.\r\nTsugumi: Did you find it much easier when you were part of the fighting yourself...?\r\nMihono: Hmmm... I don't know if I'd call either way easier... I guess? Being in the fight is hard in its own way...\r\nMihono: But... it's like, just waiting here is a different kind of hard from when I was fighting...\r\nMihono: It's frustrating, not being able to do anything...\r\nTsugumi: ...You're better suited to be a toji, aren't you.\r\nMihono: Huh?\r\nTsugumi: Here you go, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: ...Thanks a bunch.\r\nMihono: ......Itsh hot!\r\nTsugumi: Please take your time with it.\r\nMihono: Yeh... [blow- blow-]\r\nYui: Augh!?\r\nMihono: Ah--!?\r\nMihono: Yui!? What happened; are you alright!?\r\nYui: I'm fine, Mihono-chan. I just took a little hit from an aradama is all!\r\nMihono: ...Be careful, okay?\r\nYui: Sure!\r\nMihono: (Everybody's working so hard... and I'm the only one not doing anything.)\r\nMihono: (If I were there, I could fight with Kiyoka and Yui, and back up Fukki, and then Chii-nee and Mirja-san...!)\r\nMihono: Ughh!?\r\nTsugumi: Asakura-san!?\r\nTsugumi: Please try to calm down! If you lose control here...!\r\nMihono: It's okay... I don't want to get locked up either... This, isn't that bad...\r\nMihono: [pant... pant...]\r\nTsugumi: Asakura-san. Do you want to leave your seat? If you're at risk of rampaging even while acting as an operator...\r\nMihono: ...It's fine. No matter where I am, this'll probably be the same.\r\nTsugumi: ...Is that so.\r\nTsugumi: Let's send an aid request for the investigation team, just to be safe. Please help me with this, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: ...Okay.\r\nMihono: (Just thinking about how I wanted to fight with everybody was enough to almost make me lose it...)\r\nMihono: (What's... going to happen with me? Can I really keep this up...?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Tamayori Toji (1)\r\n\r\nAkira: Huh? The investigation team put out an aid request?\r\nAkira: With how tough they are, those aradama shouldn't be giving them a hard time.\r\nYuuki: What should we do?\r\nAkira: No point in asking! Let's get ready to go!\r\nAkira: We're gonna show off for Mihono!\r\nYuuki: Alright!\r\nAkira: This'll be the first time we put these in action! Get it in gear! We're gonna kick some ass!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: We've put an aid request through to the Sword Administration Bureau. A nearby unit should be on its way.\r\nMirja: Did you hear that!? Just hold out a little longer!\r\nKofuki: Huhh!? These're MY aradama-chan though!?\r\nChie: We didn't expect there to be this many aradama, or that they'd be so strong. Now's not the time to go pushing ourselves, alright?\r\nKiyoka: She's right, Kofuki-san.\r\nKofuki: Then before they get here, I'm gonna have my fill of the fun!\r\n???: Nah, we're taking over the show from here!\r\n???: You guys get outta the way!\r\nKofuki: ......Huh? What's their deal?\r\nMirja: That armor looking... Though, it's different from storm armor...\r\nYui: More importantly, isn't that...\r\nMihono: Did something happen!?\r\n???: That voice... That you, Mihono?\r\nMihono: ...Are you there, Akira-san?\r\nAkira: Huh, so you weren't here yourself. ...Guess that's why they're struggling with these aradama.\r\nAkira: Mihono. Are you seriously gonna be okay sticking with them?\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMirja: Inago Akira! Looking like that; you couldn't have...\r\nAkira: Yeah. This's tamayori. Cool as hell, right?\r\nMihono: ...Eh? Why did... you become a tamayori toji... Akira-san...?\r\nYuuki: I became a tamayori toji too, Mihono-san.\r\nMihono: Yuuki too!?\r\nMihono: Did Hitakami-san force you to be test subjects instead of me!?\r\nAkira: Don't think so low of us!\r\nMihono: --!?\r\nAkira: This's just what we wanted to happen.\r\nAkira: And you're asking if we got forced into it because of you?\r\nAkira: You think this is a joke or something, Mihono?\r\nMihono: ......\r\nAkira: Me and Yuuki are gonna show you the kind of power you passed up!\r\nAkira: Yuuki, we're taking out all the aradama around here!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Tamayori Toji (2)\r\n\r\nAkira: ORAAAAAAAAAGHH!\r\nAkira: Now that's more like it! The way this was going, it's nowhere near enough!\r\nAkira: Come on, come on! Show me what you've gooooooooooooot!!\r\nKiyoka: She beat that many aradama in the blink of an eye...\r\nAkira: Heh, nothing to it. Yuuki! I'm leaving those ones to you!\r\nYuuki: ......\r\nMirja: What's wrong!? If you're having any trouble, we can assist...\r\nYuuki: I won't need it!\r\nMirja: --!?\r\nAkira: Oi, oi, Yuuki! You're makin' the crowd worried cause you're spacing out!\r\nYuuki: I wasn't spacing out!\r\nYuuki: It's a hassle fighting them one by one, so I was only waiting for them to bunch up!\r\nYuuki: From here... please pay close attention!\r\nYuuki: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!\r\nYui: Crazy...\r\nYui: With that, it's like they don't even need us here... Ah.\r\nChie: Is this what Makoto was after...?\r\nAkira: You got it wrong. It's not just Makocchan. This's the strength we were all after.\r\nMirja: Thank you for your reinforcements. However... This doesn't excuse the incident the other day.\r\nAkira: ...You're right.\r\nAkira: I'm sorry about that, Mihono. I promise we won't do something like that again.\r\nMirja: Do you expect us to believe that?\r\nAkira: All we can say is to trust us. Like you can tell, we managed to make do without Mihono.\r\nMihono: ...It might've failed, right? Why would you do something so...\r\nAkira: Cause we figured we'd need it. And what are you doing?\r\nMihono: We're...\r\nYuuki: Mihono-san! Please work together with us! It's for your sake too!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan isn't going to help you with your ridiculous experiments!\r\nYuuki: ...You called it ridiculous?\r\nYuuki: As you can see, the tamayori experiments were a success. What we'd like Mihono-san's help with is curing the toji who were used as test subjects.\r\nYuuki: But the people who became test subjects... They gave their resolve to do it.\r\nYuuki: I won't let you call that ridiclous.\r\nKiyoka: Uh...\r\nAkira: ...They went and pulled you away from the fighting. Probably cause they don't want to deal with you.\r\nChie: It's not like that!\r\nAkira: Talk is cheap, y'know.\r\nAkira: ...Mihono, come with us. We need you.\r\nMihono: .........\r\nMihono: I'm sorry. I made up my mind to face Kanayamahime with everybody on the investigation team.\r\nAkira: ...Is that really what you're thinking?\r\nMihono: Eh?\r\nAkira: Aren't you just running away? The way things are, you're not even beginning to solve anything.\r\nAkira: So what... Are you looking to turn into Kanayamahime?\r\nMihono: --!\r\nChie: That's not going to happen! Whatever it takes, we're going to save her!\r\nAkira: No you won't. The only ones who can do that... That'd be us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Bit by Bit (1)\r\n\r\nAnnouncer: Next on the news: tamayori toji. There hasn't been a day we haven't been talking about this lately, has there?\r\nMan: It lets the toji defeat aradama safely, doesn't it? I don't see why they shouldn't use it more often.\r\nWoman: There's only been more aradama after the Great Year-End Disaster, so it'd be a waste not to.\r\nExpert: Still, tamayori toji are using aradama, aren't they? Isn't that dangerous?\r\nMakoto: That issue has already been resolved. It has practically no effect on the toji themselves.\r\nExpert: Maybe, but doesn't it feel wrong, having to wear that on their body? Is there even a point to that?\r\nMakoto: There is.\r\nMakoto: By equipping noro onto themselves, a tamayori toji is able to render attacks from aradama on the same level as that noro ineffective.\r\nMakoto: With this, it's possible to dramatically reduce the risk of injuries among toji.\r\nExpert: I-Is that right?\r\nMakoto: It is.\r\nMakoto: And, of course, it provides not only defense, but also enhances their attacks.\r\nMakoto: Okatana and noro. A toji making use of both can prove exceptionally effective against aradama.\r\nAnnouncer: That's amazing.\r\nExpert: But, even so...\r\nMakoto: The perception of noro as something dangerous is an outdated belief.\r\nMakoto: We have already successfully fused aradama with toji. I firmly believe tamayori toji will be the model of the future of toji, able to keep everyone safe.\r\nAnnouncer: Well then, why don't we move to a demonstration of how incredible tamayori toji are in practice.\r\n\r\nChie: ......\r\nMirja: Tamayori toji are yet again the focus on television today.\r\nEllen: Apparently grandpa offered to be on this debate they're showing. But Makomako turned him down.\r\nKaoru: This whole thing reeks. They say over and over it's safe, but weren't there people the experiments screwed up on?\r\nMirja: Yes, we saw it with our own eyes.\r\nChie: ......\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie?\r\nChie: Ah, I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. What were we talking about?\r\nEllen: Are you doing alright, Chie?\r\nChie: ...I'm fine.\r\nKaoru: As if. You're totally distracted.\r\nKaoru: For real... I wonder what Akira's up to right about now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Bit by Bit (2)\r\n\r\nAkira: Yo.\r\nHitakami Toji: You've been hard at work, Inago-san. Are you done with your missions for today?\r\nAkira: I had a little free time. So I came to check in.\r\nAkira: ...Has anything changed?\r\nHitakami Toji: No, I haven't seen any changes.\r\nAkira: It might take cutting through utsushi to stop tamayori, but I hate to leave you with this awful job.\r\nHitakami Toji: It doesn't bother me. I have faith that Makoto-sama will be able to cure them.\r\nAkira: Same here.\r\nAkira: ...Whoa.\r\nHitakami Toji: Are you having vertigo? Your face is looking pale...\r\nAkira: You can tell? I've been feeling kinda worn out lately.\r\nHitakami Toji: Please try not to push yourself too hard. You and Toribane-san are irreplaceable to us in the Hitakami faction.\r\nAkira: Thanks.\r\nAkira: But, whether or not the world's gonna accept tamayori toji, right now's when it counts most.\r\nAkira: I can't go complaining I'm tired or anything. Gotta go out to as many places as I can and show as many toji as possible how strong tamayori toji can be.\r\nAkira: This'll all lead back into the future of toji.\r\nHitakami Toji: Right!\r\nAkira: (Though... This tiredness is seriously no joke. What if this's one the side effects of being a tamayori toji...?)\r\nAkira: ............!\r\nAkira: (Don't go getting cold feet, Inago Akira! You know you haven't got the compatibility Mihono does! No shit something'd happen! This isn't anything you weren't prepared for!)\r\nAkira: (Just a little more... Just hold out a little longer! Makocchan's on TV, doing what she can.)\r\nAkira: (And cause of that, we've got offers lining up from people wanting to sponsor us!)\r\nAkira: (But that's all based on us being success cases! So long as Yuuki and me show results, it should go fine!)\r\nTamayori Toji: Ugh, urgh...\r\nAkira: --!\r\nHitakami Toji: If I remove her utsushi, she'll calm down. Please stand back, Inago-san.\r\nAkira: ...Nah, I'll help out.\r\nHitakami Toji: But...\r\nAkira: Just let me do this.\r\nTamayori Toji: Ina... san... I'm so...rry...\r\nAkira: You still conscious?\r\nTamayori Toji: Ye...s... Sorry for...\r\nAkira: ...There's nothing you've got to apologize for. We're gonna do whatever it takes to save you, so just rest for now.\r\nTamayori Toji: ......\r\nAkira: ...Just sleep it off a little longer. I know it won't be long.\r\nHitakami Toji: Thank you very much, Inago-san.\r\nAkira: Look after them for me.\r\nHitakami Toji: Right!\r\n\r\nMakoto: Akira-chan.\r\nAkira: Huh? What's up, Makocchan.\r\nMakoto: It's about Yuuki-chan...\r\nAkira: --!? Did something happen with Yuuki!?\r\nMakoto: She's caught a cold.\r\nAkira: ...Huh?\r\n\r\nYuuki: [cough cough]... I was careless and let myself get sick...\r\nYuuki: I was thinking I had somehow been feeling tired lately...\r\nMakoto: There's no need for you to worry over it, Yuuki-chan. Please just have a nice long rest.\r\nMakoto: Once you're better, I'll be depending on you again.\r\nYuuki: ...Okay.\r\nAkira: ......\r\nAkira: The hell, Yuuki. If you're catching colds, you must've not been training enough. You better be ready when you get better, alright?\r\nYuuki: ...Sure!\r\nAkira: So, rest up now. As far as your missions go... I'll handle 'em.\r\nAkira: I'm counting on you to help Yuuki bounce back, Makocchan.\r\nMakoto: Of course; just leave her to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Yomi and Akira\r\n\r\nYomi: ......\r\nSuzuka: Yomi-san? You look troubled; is something the matter?\r\nYomi: ...No, it's nothing.\r\nSuzuka: Are you sure?\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nYomi: It's a personal matter, so I'll resolve it myself.\r\n\r\nHitakami Toji A: There's an intruder!\r\nYomi: ...\r\nHitakami Toji B: You're... Satsuki Yomi! Why are you trespassing here!!\r\nYomi: ...I've only come to meet with a friend.\r\nHitakami Toji B: A friend!?\r\nYomi: Please let me see Inago Akira.\r\nAkira: I was wondering what was going on; it's you, huh.\r\nYomi: Akira.\r\nAkira: It's been a while. So, you came to see me?\r\nYomi: That's right.\r\nAkira: ...Then, let's head out for a bit. Right now... I don't want to go making things too noisy here.\r\nYomi: ...Alright then.\r\n\r\nAkira: We've walked pretty far. So, what'd you want?\r\nYomi: The side effects of tamayori... You've noticed them, haven't you?\r\nAkira: ...\r\nYomi: That's the underlying cause of Toribane-san's cold as well.\r\nAkira: I'm the one who should be asking how you noticed. What'd you do?\r\nYomi: I have eyes always watching around you. I've noticed several times your and Toribane-san's eyes turning red.\r\nAkira: Tch, well shit.\r\nAkira: So you've seen this then.\r\nYomi: Please stop using aradama for combat.\r\nAkira: You're one to talk.\r\nYomi: No one besides me... should have to use this power. Please suspend all research into tamayori toji.\r\nAkira: I made up my mind to deal with this. Besides, the effects aren't as bad as putting noro right in your body like myouga.\r\nYomi: But it is having an effect. Are you still going to hold to those words?\r\nAkira: Course I am. Our leader's the one saying it's safe.\r\nYomi: Akira...\r\nAkira: As buddies, I appreciate you worrying about me. Thanks.\r\nAkira: But, that's not happening. This isn't enough to make me roll over and give you an \"Oh, is that right?\"\r\nYomi: ...Does Hitakami-san know about this?\r\nAkira: ...Don't you dare tell Makocchan. Don't think I won't hold a grudge just cause you're you.\r\nYomi: ...So she doesn't know.\r\nYomi: Was the reason you brought me out here also so this conversation wouldn't reach Hitakami-san's ears?\r\nAkira: ...\r\nAkira: Since you came all the way to see me, and cause we go way back, I'll say this much.\r\nAkira: Stay out of our business. I'm not showing mercy to anyone who doesn't; not even you.\r\nYomi: ......\r\nAkira: I'm glad we got a chance to talk again. Seeya.\r\nYomi: ......Akira. I...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: A Rolling Stone (1)\r\n\r\nAnnouncer: Tamayori toji are making another strong showing today! For today's commentary, we have...\r\nRichard Friedman: Heeey, could I get a hand carrying these documents in?\r\nEllen: Yes, Grandpa! Come help too, Kaoru!\r\nKaoru: Do I have to... What do you want me to carry?\r\nFriedman: Thanks, the both of you. Here, you can take this.\r\nKaoru: ...So heavy! What's with the amount of papers in here!?\r\nEllen: These are... Documents on myouga toji?\r\nTsugumi: Yes. We prepared them for an investigation of tamayori toji.\r\nKaoru: Is that what you were up to?\r\nFriedman: This is what I had originally put together for my interview with Hitakami Makoto-kun.\r\nFriedman: Though she turned me down.\r\nYui: M-Make way please-! I've got some more documents-!\r\nKaoru: Whoa!? There's still more!?\r\nChie: This is all data on tamayori toji. Some of it is what Makoto published, but some of it was gathered independently.\r\nEllen: Independently...?\r\nMirja: It seems to be data that Origami Yukari-sama had independently collected.\r\nKiyoka: Ooph... I wonder if that's all of them?\r\nFriedman: Thanks, you were a big help.\r\nFriedman: Now then. I'm sure you're all curious to find out the results of our investigation.\r\nMihono: ......\r\nFriedman: First off, Hitakami Makoto-kun didn't lie to us. Its capabilities against aradama are greater than myouga toji, and the effects on the body aren't as drastic.\r\nMihono: So basically... that means tamayori toji are safe?\r\nFriedman: It's a little too soon to come to that conclusion.\r\nFriedman: This is only talking about the capabilities, but the problem is, what kind of effects does it have on the body?\r\nFriedman: And about that... She phrased it very deliberately. It has \"practically\" no effects on a toji.\r\nTsugumi: Not all that much time has passed since they began using tamayori toji, but side-effects seem to already be showing.\r\nMihono: Huh!?\r\nTsugumi: So far, it's confirmed to have had an effect on their physical condition.\r\nFriedman: It doesn't look to have any effects on the mind like with myouga toji, but it's started having an influence elsewhere.\r\nFriedman: Though the impact only seems minor so far.\r\nYui: So basically... we don't have to worry too much for now?\r\nFriedman: No, it's not as simple as that.\r\nFriedman: To give an example... How about this. Think of tamayori toji like catching a cold.\r\nFriedman: Inago-kun and Toribane-kun are only showing a fever. But... the toji who experienced it before them are showing signs of pneumonia and other worse conditions.\r\nFriedman: And there's no guarantee Inago-kun and Toribane-kun's cases won't escalate to that point.\r\nMirja: Then you're saying, if for whatever reason, they're unable to regulate their noro, they might become like the tamayori toji test subject we saw before?\r\nFriedman: That's how it is.\r\nFriedman: And, whatever it could take to cause that, it could be happening at this very moment for all we know.\r\nFriedman: ...This technology wasn't ready to be implemented yet. That's what I believe.\r\nChie: ......\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: A Rolling Stone (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Ellen-san!\r\nEllen: Chie? What's wrong?\r\nChie: There's something I wanted to discuss with you.\r\nChie: ......I want to talk with Makoto. Please, help me out, Ellen-san!\r\nEllen: I don't mind helping, but, why did you come to me?\r\nChie: Right now... I don't want Mihono-chan coming near Makoto. I can't make the investigation team act on this.\r\nEllen: ......\r\nEllen: Alright then! Let's come up with a plan to go see Makoto!\r\n\r\nAkane: You want to meet and speak with Hitakami Makoto-san...?\r\nEllen: Yes! And, we were planning on bringing Grandpa, to discuss tamayori toji with her, with Chie and myself as his guards.\r\nChie: Please let us go. I want to talk with Makoto... at least once.\r\nAkane: ...Very well then.\r\nChie: Thank you very much!\r\nAkane: However, I'll be adding one more member. Suzuka-san from the Special Defense Team will be accompanying you.\r\nEllen: It'll be reassuring having Hanahana along!\r\nAkane: We can work out the details here, if you would.\r\n\r\n...Several days later.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: It's been a while since we had a day off, hasn't it!\r\nMihono: They sorta gave us a break all of a sudden, but... is it really okay for us to not be doing anything?\r\nYui: It's fine, it's fine! Things have been really rough lately, so we've gotta find time to relax too!\r\n???: Are you Asakura Mihono?\r\nMihono: That's me...?\r\nKiyoka: ...Who are you?\r\n???: I'll need you to come quietly with us.\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan...\r\nYui: Yeah... Mihono-chan, you stand back!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: Back to Tohoku (1)\r\n\r\n???: Kh...\r\nKiyoka: Attacking us out of nowhere like that... What are you after?\r\nYui: I'll take a pretty lady coming after me any day, so it's too bad that's not what you're here for.\r\nMihono: Did Hitakami-san order you to do this...?\r\nYui: Boss said they wouldn't be coming after Mihono-chan anymore though?\r\n???: ...There's still a use for you.\r\nKiyoka: A use for her... Is that all Hono-chan is to you!?\r\nYui: ...Take it easy, Kiyoka-chan. For starters, what do you mean, there's a use for her?\r\nYui: Does that mean Mihono-chan's going to keep being targeted in the future?\r\n???: To get Kanayamahime... we're willing to do anything it takes.\r\n???: While we're talking, my partners should have taken Richard Friedman and his guards captive.\r\nMihono: Friedman-san and his guards...?\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan... Does she mean...?\r\nYui: ...Yeah.\r\nMihono: Kiyoka? Yui? Do you two know something about this...?\r\n???: It looks like they kept it secret from you.\r\nKiyoka: ...Today, Friedman-san, Chie-san, Ellen-san, and Konohana-san were going to talk with Hitakami Makoto-san...\r\nMihono: But, nobody told me about that!\r\nYui: Just calm down, Mihono-chan.\r\nYui: Chie-san talked to us about it. She didn't want to make you worried, so we shouldn't let you know.\r\nYui: Since they succeeded with tamayori toji, they were only going there to talk, so it should be fine...\r\n???: Fufu...\r\nMihono: --! I-I'm going to try calling Chii-nee!\r\nMihono: ............\r\nMihono: It's no good; she's not picking up!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: Back to Tohoku (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: ............\r\nMihono: It's no good; she's not picking up!\r\n???: It's pointless.\r\nMihono: I'm going to call Mirja-san.\r\nMirja: This is Kitora Mirja.\r\nMihono: Mirja-san, are you there!? It's Chii-nee, they got Chii-nee!\r\nMirja: ...What do you mean? Calm down and explain everything to me, Asakura Mihono.\r\nMihono: Uhh, we got attacked by somebody who seems to be working for Hitakami-san, and they said they took Chii-nee captive!\r\nMirja: The Hitakami faction is attacking you...?\r\nMirja: I understand; I'll try contacting Setouchi Chie from here as well...\r\nMirja: ............\r\nMirja: You're right; I can't reach her.\r\nMihono: What should we do!?\r\nMirja: You need to calm down.\r\nMirja: Including Setouchi Chie, the toji who went to speak with Hitakami Makoto are all highly capable. They wouldn't be taken captive by the Hitakami faction so easily.\r\nMirja: Above all, it would be wise to consider that this could be a trap. First, we need to question this Hitakami toji who attacked you...\r\nMihono: I don't care if it's a trap!\r\nMihono: The Hitakamis have tamayori toji... There's Akira-san and Yuuki there, right!?\r\nMihono: If they had to protect Friedman-san, then even Chii-nee and them could've...\r\nMirja: Before anything, we need to contact Setouchi Chie and the others. Even if we can't reach them by phone, there are other ways to...\r\nMihono: What are you going to do if it's too late!?\r\nMirja: ...Please calm down. The next time you lose control, you are going to lose your freedom.\r\nMihono: I know that, but I can't help it!! If I don't go save Chii-nee right now... I know I'll regret it for the rest of my life!!\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono...\r\nMirja: (...I need to avoid letting her become any more unstable. There's no way of knowing what could trigger her next rampage. Staying in contact with her through this remains the best option...)\r\nMirja: Fine then. However, I cannot allow you to be sent there alone.\r\nMirja: All members of the investigation team will go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: Chie and Makoto (1)\r\n\r\nEllen: From what you told me, I had my guard up, but they let us through like it's no big deal.\r\nChie: Y-You're not wrong... But, last time, they wouldn't even let us enter the grounds...\r\nSuzuka: This visit came with an official notice from Akane-sama. Even Hitakami Makoto wouldn't have outright refused us.\r\nFriedman: We'll have to give our thanks to Akane-sama then.\r\nMakoto: I'm sorry to keep you waiting.\r\nMakoto: It's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. Friedman.\r\nFriedman: Right, it's good to meet you. You did turn me down when we were going to debate on TV. So I was looking forward to today.\r\nMakoto: I had hoped to hear your advice in a more worthwhile environment, not something like that.\r\nMakoto: ...Would you lend us your knowledge, in order to treat the toji who assisted with the experiments?\r\nFriedman: I would be glad to.\r\nMakoto: Thank you very much.\r\nEllen: ...Chie? Is Makoto really a bad guy? She sure doesn't seem like it... (whispered)\r\nChie: I-I know... She isn't any different from the Makoto I remember... (whispered)\r\nMakoto: In that case, we'll lead you to the research facility.\r\nLab Worker: Dr. Friedman, if you'd come with me.\r\nFriedman: Sure, lead the way.\r\nMakoto: ...\r\nFriedman: Oh? You won't be coming with us, Hitakami-kun?\r\nMakoto: No, I'm afraid I'd only get in the way of a more technical discussion.\r\nSuzuka: ...I'll be going along with Dr. Friedman.\r\nSuzuka: Setouchi-san, Kohagura-san, you should hear what you need to from Hitakami-san.\r\nChie: ...Makoto.\r\nMakoto: It's been too long, Chie-san. I'm glad... to meet with you again.\r\nChie: ...I'd rather something else brought us back together, if I could help it.\r\nMakoto: You mean what happened with Asakura Mihono-san, don't you.\r\nMakoto: I would like to apologize for the somewhat aggressive methods we took with her.\r\nMakoto: However, Chie-san. I don't believe we were entirely wrong.\r\nMakoto: If we consider Asakura-san's circumstances, it's a fact that she would be better situated here with us.\r\nChie: You're not the one who gets to decide that.\r\nMakoto: If you only follow your emotions, you won't be there in time for her.\r\nChie: Makoto!\r\nEllen: Please calm down, Chie.\r\nEllen: Makoto, I think you've already realized, but we came here to ask you to stop using tamayori toji.\r\nMakoto: That would be the only reason for you to come meet with me now, wouldn't it.\r\nMakoto: However... I have no reason to follow your request.\r\nMakoto: The research into tamayori toji could not be going better. It's nearly every day we come across new data we never could have achieved before.\r\nMakoto: As of now, only a select few can make use of it... But, before long, I'm sure it will be possible for every toji to become tamayori toji.\r\nEllen: And you'd sacrifice Akira and Yuuki for that?\r\nMakoto: ...What are you getting at?\r\nChie: Inago-san and Toribane-san are having negative side-effects, aren't they?\r\nMakoto: ...I haven't received any reports about that.\r\nEllen: But you're hearing about it now, aren't you?\r\nMakoto: ......\r\nMakoto: These are all things we've prepared for.\r\nChie: Why go this far, Makoto? In the past, you wouldn't have...\r\nMakoto: Dirtied my hands with these experiments?\r\nMakoto: ...No matter when you're thinking of me, I haven't changed, Chie-san.\r\nChie: Is this because of what happened back then? After that, you...\r\nMakoto: I won't deny that it's one of the causes.\r\nMakoto: I simply... don't want there to be any more toji like Miyako-san.\r\nMakoto: I don't anyone else to experience the things we have...\r\nChie: ......\r\nChie: I understand that feeling. But still, I'm against you using noro for that.\r\nMakoto: I wouldn't stop no matter who's against me.\r\nMakoto: When Inago and Toribane... became tamayori toji in my place, I resolved to that.\r\n\r\nEllen: We're not going to be convincing her. She seemed very determined to me.\r\nChie: Right...\r\nEllen: I know about what happened to Miyako. You and Makoto were...\r\nChie: We were in the same unit. Makoto and Miyako especially were paired up...\r\nEllen: ...So that's why.\r\nChie: Yes...\r\nEllen: What do you think we should do, Chie?\r\nChie: I understand what Makoto is thinking now. But, even still... I can't think tamayori toji are the right answer.\r\nEllen: Neither can I.\r\nEllen: I'd like it if aradama and humans could coexist, but this isn't what that should look like.\r\nEllen: If it can't make everyone happier, there's no point to it!\r\nChie: Ellen-san...\r\nChie: --!? Is that an alarm!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13: Chie and Makoto (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Chii-nee! Where are you!? Say something! Chii-nee!!\r\nAkira: I was wondering what all the noise was about; it's you guys.\r\nMihono: Akira-san! Please give me back Chii-nee!\r\nAkira: Give her back? What're you talking about, Mihono? They're free to leave whenever they're done with their inspection.\r\nMirja: ...This morning, Asakura Mihono was attacked by one of your associates.\r\nAkira: Huh? What do you mean? I don't know a thing about that.\r\nYui: ...Maybe you didn't know, Boss, but are you sure that Hitakami-san person didn't order them to?\r\nAkira: Makocchan wouldn't do something like that either! Only ones who would are... So that's how it is.\r\nKofuki: What's the deal then? Didn't Chichie get kidnapped?\r\nKiyoka: I'm not sure, but... this all feels weird, doesn't it?\r\n???: Don't let Asakura Mihono get away!\r\nAkira: ...Figures.\r\nAkira: What the hell are you going off starting on your own!?\r\n???: Asakura Mihono is the one who came to attack us.\r\nAkira: Cause you went and baited her, right? Or... Not you, but the group of heads backing you.\r\nHitakami Faction Head Group Toji: ...We followed our own judgment. If you're going to get between us... We won't have a choice.\r\nHitakami Faction Head Group Toji: You're up! Bring down Inago-san with them if you have to!\r\nTamayori Toji: ...\r\nAkira: What're you in that for...\r\nTamayori Toji: I was only able to become a proper tamayori toji like this thanks to you, Inago-san.\r\nAkira: \"Proper\"?\r\nAkira: Get the fuck out of here! Nobody besides me and Yuuki can get the noro off of them!\r\nTamayori Toji: I'm prepared for whatever comes. Regardless, I believe this is what's necessary for the future of toji.\r\nAkira: You goddamn idiots! Mihono!\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah!?\r\nAkira: I'm backing you up!\r\nAkira: I'm gonna smash their faces in, till they never think of doing something this stupid again!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14: The Scheme's Consequence (1)\r\n\r\nTamayori Toji: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nMihono: Kgh...!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, stay behind me!\r\nMihono: O-Okay!\r\nMirja: ...A tamayori toji with their consciousness intact is that much more troublesome than the one we faced before.\r\nKofuki: It's not like we can ignore the other ones either; what do we do, Mirja!?\r\nMirja: Do not fight the tamayori toji head on! Move to create an opening!\r\nYui: That's easy to say, but, like this...!\r\nHitakami Faction Head Group Toji: YAAAAAH!\r\nYui: Uwah!?\r\nAkira: Don't you touch Yui, asshole!\r\nHitakami Faction Head Group Toji: Urgh...\r\nAkira: You alright, Yui!?\r\nYui: Th-Thanks a lot, Boss!\r\nYui: Or, wait, Boss! Can't you become a tamayori toji too!? Wouldn't that make this way easier!\r\nAkira: No can do! I haven't got noro on me now!\r\nMihono: (Everybody's struggling... If I had some way to use Kanayamahime's power without going berserk...)\r\nMihono: ...Rrgh!?\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan!?\r\nMihono: But, ghh...\r\nAkira: Is she losing control!? You can't, Mihono! You've gotta...!\r\nMihono: AAAAAAAARRRGGGHHHHHH!!\r\nChie: Everyone! ...Mihono-chan!?\r\nMihono: ......\r\nChie: No... Mihono-chan! Hey, can you hear me!?\r\nEllen: ...Chie.\r\nEllen: ...We have to stop Mihomiho's from rampaging before we can do anything.\r\nEllen: Kaoru told me all she had to do was cut through her utsushi...\r\nAkira: That's right...\r\nHitakami Faction Head Group Toji: We did it! We actually did it! Now, we can...\r\nAkira: You think this is the time for that!?\r\nHitakami Faction Head Group Toji: Ugh...\r\nMakoto: Akira-chan!\r\nAkira: ...I'm sorry. I couldn't stop things from going to shit.\r\nMakoto: ...It's not your fault.\r\nChie: Makoto! Is this what you wanted!?\r\nMakoto: ...Right now, we need to take care of Asakura-san...\r\nChie: I don't need you to tell me that...! I'll be the one to bring Mihono-chan back!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15: The Scheme's Consequence (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Mihono-chan! Please, just go back to normal...!!\r\nMihono: Rrgh!\r\nMihono: ...\r\nChie: ......\r\nHitakami Faction Head Group Toji: Go now; capture Asakura Mihono!\r\nMakoto: You mustn't let them have Asakura-san!\r\nKofuki: Like you have to say it!\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie, take care of Asakura Mihono! Musumi Kiyoka, Yamashiro Yui, protect Setouchi Chie!\r\nChie: I'm on it! Cover us, you two!\r\nKiyoka/Yui: Right!\r\nAkira: These are...

Don't drag Mihono into something so stupid...!\r\nAkane: ...\r\nAkane: Asakura-san will be placed in confinement at a Ministry of Defense facility. And, that's where...

I've seen you sometimes, at Ban-san's lab.\r\nSakura: Though, this is the first time we've had an actual conversation.\r\nChie: That's right.\r\nChie: As soon as you're done treating us, you always leave right away, Hamatsuka-san.\r\nSakura: ...I'm sorry.\r\nChie: Fufu, it's not anything you need to apologize for.\r\nChie: Though, I've always thought that I wanted to talk with you, so I'm glad.\r\nChie: No matter how small the injury, you always treat it with care, don't you, Hamatsuka-san? So I was curious what sort of girl you were.\r\nSakura: But, I'm not that...\r\nNurse: We're going to be starting the practical exercise soon.

What do you want me to carry?\r\nFriedman: Thanks, the both of you. Here, you can take this.\r\nKaoru: ...So heavy! What's with the amount of papers in here!?\r\nEllen: These are... Documents on myouga toji?\r\nTsugumi: Yes. We prepared them for an investigation of tamayori toji.\r\nKaoru: Is that what you were up to?\r\nFriedman: This is what I had originally put together for my interview with Hitakami Makoto-kun.\r\nFriedman: Though she turned me down.\r\nYui: M-Make way please-! I've got some more documents-!\r\nKaoru: Whoa!? There's still more!?\r\nChie: This is all data on tamayori toji. Some of it is what Makoto published, but some of it was gathered independently.\r\nEllen: Independently...?\r\nMirja: It seems to be data that Origami Yukari-sama had independently collected.\r\nKiyoka: Ooph... I wonder if that's all of them?\r\nFriedman: Thanks, you were a big help.\r\nFriedman: Now then. I'm sure you're all curious to find out the results of our investigation.\r\nMihono: ......\r\nFriedman: First off, Hitakami Makoto-kun didn't lie to us. Its capabilities against aradama are greater than myouga toji, and the effects on the body aren't as drastic.\r\nMihono: So basically... that means tamayori toji are safe?\r\nFriedman: It's a little too soon to come to that conclusion.\r\nFriedman: This is only talking about the capabilities, but the problem is, what kind of effects does it have on the body?\r\nFriedman: And about that... She phrased it very deliberately. It has \"practically\" no effects on a toji.\r\nTsugumi: Not all that much time has passed since they began using tamayori toji, but side-effects seem to already be showing.\r\nMihono: Huh!?\r\nTsugumi: So far, it's confirmed to have had an effect on their physical condition.\r\nFriedman: It doesn't look to have any effects on the mind like with myouga toji, but it's started having an influence elsewhere.\r\nFriedman: Though the impact only seems minor so far.\r\nYui: So basically... we don't have to worry too much for now?\r\nFriedman: No, it's not as simple as that.\r\nFriedman: To give an example... How about this. Think of tamayori toji like catching a cold.\r\nFriedman: Inago-kun and Toribane-kun are only showing a fever. But... the toji who experienced it before them are showing signs of pneumonia and other worse conditions.\r\nFriedman: And there's no guarantee Inago-kun and Toribane-kun's cases won't escalate to that point.\r\nMirja: Then you're saying, if for whatever reason, they're unable to regulate their noro, they might become like the tamayori toji test subject we saw before?\r\nFriedman: That's how it is.\r\nFriedman: And, whatever it could take to cause that, it could be happening at this very moment for all we know.\r\nFriedman: ...This technology wasn't ready to be implemented yet.

Is that all Hono-chan is to you!?\r\nYui: ...Take it easy, Kiyoka-chan. For starters, what do you mean, there's a use for her?\r\nYui: Does that mean Mihono-chan's going to keep being targeted in the future?\r\n???: To get Kanayamahime... we're willing to do anything it takes.\r\n???: While we're talking, my partners should have taken Richard Friedman and his guards captive.\r\nMihono: Friedman-san and his guards...?\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan...

She didn't want to make you worried, so we shouldn't let you know.\r\nYui: Since they succeeded with tamayori toji, they were only going there to talk, so it should be fine...\r\n???: Fufu...\r\nMihono: --!

They wouldn't be taken captive by the Hitakami faction so easily.\r\nMirja: Above all, it would be wise to consider that this could be a trap. First, we need to question this Hitakami toji who attacked you...\r\nMihono: I don't care if it's a trap!\r\nMihono: The Hitakamis have tamayori toji... There's Akira-san and Yuuki there, right!?\r\nMihono: If they had to protect Friedman-san, then even Chii-nee and them could've...\r\nMirja: Before anything, we need to contact Setouchi Chie and the others. Even if we can't reach them by phone, there are other ways to...\r\nMihono: What are you going to do if it's too late!?\r\nMirja: ...Please calm down. The next time you lose control, you are going to lose your freedom.\r\nMihono: I know that, but I can't help it!! If I don't go save Chii-nee right now... I know I'll regret it for the rest of my life!!\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono...\r\nMirja: (...I need to avoid letting her become any more unstable.

If the signal disappeared, that's all it could be, right?\r\nSayaka: Is there a different unit here too?\r\nSuu: Did they double book? Then, that means we can leave it all to that unit and go back home!\r\nYomi: If that is the case, the other unit will be responsible for suppressing the aradama while we hurry to recover the Akabane sword.\r\nSuu: Great!\r\nYomi: We'll go confirm at the scene. All members, please apply utsushi.\r\nYomi: ...We're moving.\r\n\r\nSuu: It's a good thing we'll finish this mission smoothly, huh!\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nSuu: ...What are you making that face for, Kiyoka-san?\r\nKiyoka: I just have a bit of a bad feeling about this...\r\nSuu: D-Don't go raising flags like that. You're spooking me out of nowhere...\r\nSayaka: ...I wish Mai were here.\r\nKanami: I know what you mean. It'd be a real relief having Mai with us, since she can use myougan.\r\nSayaka: ...Mm.\r\nSuu: ...Eh? Is there actually something here...?\r\nYomi: Please put an end to the chatter. ...I can see something.\r\nKiyoka: Is that Hono-chan, Chie-san, and Yui-chan?\r\nKanami: It is them.\r\nSuu: Thank goodness...

Wait, can we even cut that with okatana!?\r\nKanami: We'll just have to find out!\r\nKanami: Chidori can even cut through lightning, so...

Didn't they come just in time to back up the rest?\r\n??? (Nanoha): Still, I think they're different.\r\n???

We're sorry we attacked you! It might be a little late, but we'd like to talk with you!\r\nSuu: They want to talk...\r\nKiyoka: ...What do we do?\r\nKanami: Let's hear them out.\r\nKanami: When I crossed swords with that blonde girl...

Like, what that power was you attacked us with...\r\nNanoha: That was magic.\r\nKiyoka: Magic...? You mean like, the kind in games and stories?\r\nHayate: You can think of it like that. We're contract mages from the Time-Space Administrative Bureau, and we came here from another Earth.\r\nSuu: Magic and mages and another Earth? S-She suddenly threw out a bunch of fantasy stuff...\r\nSayaka: But, I don't feel like they're lying.\r\nKanami: ...Same.\r\nNanoha: The reason we came to this Earth was to investigate something. We detected a strange reading, and...\r\nKiyoka: Why did you attack Hono-chan and them?\r\nNanoha: That's because... Earlier, those girls came attacking us, so we only fought back in self-defense.\r\nNanoha: And... Uhh. Er, could you tell us your names?\r\nKanami: Oh, I'm Etou Kanami. And, going around, this is Itomi Sayaka-chan, Musumi Kiyoka-san, Inami Suu-chan, and Satsuki Yomi-san.\r\nNanoha: Thank you very much, Kanami-san.\r\nNanoha: And we thought you were with them, Kanami-san, so we fought you too... But you seemed sort of different... Ah!\r\nNanoha: We used a non-lethal setting, so, while they're unconscious, those girls shouldn't be hurt or anything!\r\nSuu: Non-lethal setting... So magic can do stuff like that...\r\nYomi: ...I'll check on Asakura-san and the others. If they're only unconscious, I'll take that into consideration.\r\nYomi: Musumi-san, please come with me.\r\nKiyoka: Ah, right!\r\nKanami: Oh, I'll go too!\r\nKanami: You know... why were Mihono-chan and them here in the first place?\r\nKiyoka: I'm not sure. They're supposed to be away on an expedition right about now... Huh?\r\nKiyoka: That okatana... That's not Kashuu Kiyomitsu.\r\nYomi: This is an Akabane sword.\r\nMihono?: --!\r\nKiyoka: KYAA!?\r\nKiyoka: This person... They're not Hono-chan! It's an aradama!\r\nMimic Aradama: ...\r\nSayaka: Watch out!\r\nSuu: EEP!?\r\nSuu: (Even though it looked like Mihono-san... She didn't even hesitate to chop it down!)\r\nMimic Aradama: ...\r\nYomi: ...Setouchi-san and Yamashiro-san are aradama as well.\r\nYomi: --!!\r\nYomi: ...You mentioned a strange reading. Did it have to do with these aradama?\r\nHayate: We're still investigating, so we don't know.\r\nFate: Are aradama like this rare?\r\nKiyoka: Aradama that can mimic a person this closely are definitely rare.\r\nFate: Then... I can't say for sure, but it's probably connected.\r\nYomi: ...Have you all heard the rumors about doppelgangers?\r\nKanami: Ah, we have.\r\nYomi: Currently, the Special Defense Team has had considerable reports of damage caused by these doppelgangers.\r\nYomi: We still don't know what is causing this situation.\r\nKiyoka: If the doppelgangers are actually mimic aradama, we have to solve this right away!\r\nNanoha: Um... Please let us work with you!\r\nKanami: Huh?\r\nNanoha: The reason we came to this world was to prevent a crisis that might happen!\r\nNanoha: Even if it's not our world, I don't want to see people in trouble, or sad, or crying... I want to rescue them! We want to help you!\r\nFate/Hayate: Please let us!\r\nYomi: ...\r\nKanami: I think it's fine.\r\nKanami: We'll need Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, and Hayate-chan's help to get to the bottom of this mission.\r\nYomi: ...Very well then.\r\nYomi: First, I'll make a report to the Sword Administration Bureau. Once that's finished, we'll begin taking action.\r\nNanoha/Fate/Hayate: Thank you very much!\r\nYomi: This is Satsuki Yomi, of the Special Defense Team. I've identified the true form of these doppelgangers to be aradama.\r\nYomi: Their disguises are fairly sophisticated, so it's likely they will be mistaken for the real person. If any toji are behaving strangely... Eh?\r\nYomi: ...Yes.\r\nKiyoka: What's wrong?\r\nYomi: It seems that Ban-san, Kitora-san, and Tsubakuro-san have all taken out Akabane swords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: A Promise for After We're Done\r\n\r\nKanami: It was really shocking, seeing aradama mimic Mihono-chan and them.\r\nKiyoka: Yeah...\r\nKiyoka: Even more than when we fought mimic aradama before... This Mihono-chan felt more like a person to me.\r\nKanami: Yeah... maybe you're right. The mimic aradama back then were more like monsters than this...\r\nKiyoka: I don't really want to remember it... That was traumatizing...\r\nSayaka: If she didn't have an Akabane sword, would you have realized it?\r\nKiyoka: N-No. That's how much it seemed like the real thing.\r\nSayaka: ...\r\nSayaka: Nanoha, Fate, Hayate. What was it like fighting Mihono and them?\r\nNanoha: I don't know much about swordfighting styles and that kind of thing, but they were using their swords properly.\r\nSuu: If it's enough for there to be rumors about them, the doppelgangers are probably pretty close to the real person, right?\r\nKanami: Do you think there's aradama mimicking us too?\r\nKiyoka: Who can say? We don't know what basis is causing mimic aradama to show up...\r\nFate: We've fought several mimic aradama so far, but none of them looked like any of you.\r\nHayate: Oh yeah, Nanoha-chan! We'd better hand those over to the toji.\r\nNanoha: Ah! These are Akabane swords we took from mimic aradama we fought before.\r\nYomi: I'll hold onto them.\r\nYomi: Though... why did you recover their Akabane swords?\r\nNanoha: We thought that maybe it was these swords... the Akabane swords that were causing the toji to act strangely...\r\nFate: Though, it was them being mimic aradama that was strange, so our assumption was off...\r\nHayate: Ah! We just left the mimic aradama like they were too!\r\nYomi: Without an okatana, you won't be able to suppress aradama. I believe that should still be the case for magic.\r\nNanoha: So we can't beat them with magic...\r\nHayate: ...Though, something comes to mind.\r\nNanoha: Fate-chan, Hayate-chan.\r\nFate: Right.\r\nHayate: Yeah, we'd better prepare just in case.\r\nYomi: If you use magic to cover for us, there won't be any issues. We'll dispose of the mimic aradama.\r\nKanami: Hey, Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan. Tell me what it was like fighting toji.\r\nKanami: I want to know how it felt for a magical girl.\r\nFate: The first that comes to mind is... They were hard to fight.\r\nKanami: Hard to fight?\r\nFate: They would grow fast, powerful, and tough... You can't let your guard down fighting someone capable at swordfighting.\r\nKiyoka: That would be jin'i, hachimanriki, and kongoushin.\r\nFate: Also, I don't get many chances to fight with people who know real swordfighting, so I learned lots from it!\r\nKanami: Well then, once this is over, let's spar together! The way you were moving before got me interested, Fate-chan!\r\nSayaka: I'm interested too. I want to try fighting seriously with Fate.\r\nFate: The pleasure would be all mine!\r\nKanami: What about you two, Nanoha-chan, Hayate-chan?\r\nNanoha: I think I'll... hold off. I'm not so good with close quarters combat...\r\nKanami: It didn't really look that way to me though...\r\nHayate: I'll pass on that too. Signum would've been happy to, but... Ah, Signum's from my family; she's a swordfighter.\r\nFate: She's a very powerful knight.\r\nNanoha: You're right, she probably would love to fight with the toji.\r\nFate: Will you be joining us, Kiyoka-san, Suu-san?\r\nKiyoka: Sure, if you'll have me.\r\nSuu: I'll stay out of it by any means necessary! Cause there's no way I could handle that!!\r\nYomi: Please leave any sparring until after this case is resolved.\r\nKanami: Got it! Let's work hard at this, Fate-chan!\r\nFate: Of course, Kanami-san!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Meeting the Aradama\r\n\r\nYomi: It seems that Ban-san, Kitora-san, and Tsubakuro-san have all taken out Akabane swords.\r\nKiyoka: If it were just Tsugumi-san and Mirja-san, I could understand it... But Tsubakuro-san being in there feels wrong.\r\nYomi: There's no doubt those three are mimic aradama.\r\nYomi: Since they've taken Akabane swords, we can't ignore them. We'll go take care of this.\r\nNanoha: What should we do?\r\nYomi: We'll split into three teams.\r\nYomi: First... Etou-san and Takamachi-san.\r\nKanami/Nanoha: Yes!\r\nYomi: Please go after Ban-san.\r\nKanami: Understood. I'm with you, Nanoha-chan!\r\nNanoha: Okay, Kanami-san!\r\nYomi: Next... Musumi-san and Harlaown-san.\r\nKiyoka/Fate: Yes.\r\nYomi: The three of us, with me included, will go after Kitora-san.\r\nFate: I'll be in your care, Yomi-san, Kiyoka-san.\r\nKiyoka: Mmhm! Let's do our best together, Fate-chan!\r\nYomi: Lastly...\r\nHayate: Me, Sayaka-san, and Suu-san are going after this Tsubakuro-san person, right!\r\nYomi: Yes, please do.\r\nSuu: Wait, hang on a minute! Why do I have to fight Tsubakuro-sama!?\r\nYomi: I'd have Itomi-san handle Tsubakuro-san. Inami-san, please give Itomi-san your support.\r\nSayaka: ...Mm, I'll beat Tsubakuro Yume.\r\nSuu: There's no way I can do this!\r\nYomi: You should be fine.\r\nSuu: What gives you that idea!?\r\nHayate: Hey now. Let's just give it our best shot, Suu-san.\r\nSuu: Hayate-chan... Actually, it's hard to tell which of us is older here...\r\nHayate: You think so? Doesn't seem that way to me.\r\nYomi: With that, all members, please head towards your targets.\r\n\r\nKanami: Found you... Ban-san!\r\nTsugumi?: Oh? What's wrong, Etou-san? That girl with you, is she lost?\r\nKanami: No, she's not lost... Wait... Ban-san...?\r\nTsugumi?: Yes? Do you see anyone besides me here?\r\nKanami: I don't...\r\nKanami: (This is just like talking to the real Ban-san...)\r\nTsugumi?: If you don't need anything from me, could I leave? I'm in a bit of a hurry.\r\nKanami: (She's just like the real thing. If I didn't know any better, I'd be fooled for sure.)\r\nNanoha: ...Kanami-san, please be careful.\r\nKanami: Don't worry, Nanoha-chan. I was just surprised at how similar it is to the real thing.\r\nTsugumi?: Ah-, did you just come to chat? Then you're in my way.\r\nNanoha: What is it you're after? Why did you take an Akabane sword?\r\nTsugumi Mimic:  ......So you figured it all out. Because of this girl?\r\nNanoha: Please give us the Akabane sword.\r\nTsugumi: I refuse. This is something we need.\r\nTsugumi: Though... Against Etou-san, I won't have a chance. There's no other way around it; I'll have to call for help.\r\nKanami: Help?\r\nMimic Aradama: ...\r\nTsugumi: Please handle them-.\r\nMimic Aradama: --!\r\nNanoha: Kanami-san!\r\nNanoha: I'll stop the aradama from moving with Bind! That's your chance!\r\nKanami: Leave it to me!\r\nNanoha: Here goes... Bind!\r\nTsugumi: Gh, my body won't move!? What is this...!\r\nNanoha: Now!\r\nKanami: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nTsugumi: Kh, for this to...\r\nNAnoha: We did it, Kanami-san! Now for the rest of the aradama...\r\nKanami: I already beat them.\r\nNanoha: Already!?\r\nKanami: I did have you backing me up.\r\nNanoha: I didn't know you were that powerful, Kanami-san...\r\nKanami: Thanks for the compliment! But, so long as I have your help, I'm as strong as a hundred people!\r\nKanami: Anyway, we got the Akabane sword, though... what do you think she was going to do with it...?\r\nNanoha: We probably should have asked before we beat her.\r\nKanami: ...Ah.\r\n\r\nFate: YAAAAAAAAHH!!\r\nMirja Mimic: What is that speed!?\r\nFate: Kiyoka-san!\r\nKiyoka: Right!\r\nKiyoka: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMirja Mimic: Krh, Musumi Kiyokaaa!!\r\nKiyoka: ...Don't call my name!\r\nKiyoka: The real Mirja-san... is much more impressive than you!\r\nMirja: Ggh...!?\r\nYomi: It's over.\r\nYomi: Why did you withdraw an Akabane sword?\r\nMirja Mimic: I was only following orders! I have nothing more to say!\r\nYomi: Is that so.\r\nYomi: -!!\r\nMirja Mimic: Gh...\r\nYomi: Suppression complete.\r\nYomi: Musumi-san, please recover the Akabane sword.\r\nKiyoka: R-Right!\r\nFate: I'll help you.\r\nKiyoka: Thank you. You know... You're incredible, Fate-chan.\r\nKiyoka: Going around with that flash of yellow light... It's like seeing lightning.\r\nFate: Thank you very much.\r\nFate: Though, you move quite quickly yourself, Kiyoka-san... You were strong.\r\nKiyoka: That's... all thanks to Mirja-san and everyone.\r\nKiyoka: I used to be useless and scared of aradama, but I only grew past it thanks to the investigation team.\r\nFate: ...Did you find it hard fighting against someone who looked the same as this Mirja person?\r\nKiyoka: If I'm honest... A little.\r\nYomi: Musumi-san, Harlaown-san. There's someone giving orders to the mimic aradama to take Akabane swords.\r\nYomi: I'm going to report to the Sword Administration Bureau, so please wait a moment.\r\nKiyoka: Alright.\r\nFate: I'll pass this on to Nanoha and Hayate too.\r\nKiyoka: Huh, so you have magic that works like a phone too.\r\nFate: We do.\r\nFate: (This is Fate. ...Nanoha, Hayate, can you hear me?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: A Hard Fought Battle\r\n\r\nFate: (This is Fate. ...Nanoha, Hayate, can you hear me?)\r\nHayate: (Hayate here! ...Sorry, Fate-chan! In the middle of a fight right now!)\r\nYume Mimic: Aha!\r\nYume Mimic: Sayaka-chan's tough alright! But... can you handle this!?\r\nSayaka: Kh...\r\nYume Mimic: Ahahaha! That's not the best you've got, right, Sayaka-chan! Do it better than that!\r\nHayate: Sayaka-san!!\r\nSayaka: ......I'm fine. You support Suu, Hayate.\r\nHayate: ...Okay!\r\nHayate: (Suu-san is...)\r\nSuu: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\r\nMimic Aradama: GUOOOOO!\r\nSuuu: It's not down yet!?\r\nMimic Aradama: OOOOOOOOO!!\r\nHayate: I'll back you up, Suu-san!\r\nSuu: Thanks, Hayate-chan!\r\nSuu: HAHH!!\r\nSuu: [pant pant]...\r\nHokuto Mimic: ...\r\nSuu: --!? There's an aradama mimicking Hokuto-san!?\r\nHokuto Mimic: ...!\r\nSuu: Aaah!?\r\nHokuto Mimic: ...!\r\nSuu: Gh!\r\nSuu: (My utsushi... This is the sixth time...)\r\nSuu: But, for just this aradama... Don't you dare... COPY HOKUTO-SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!\r\nSuu: [pant pant]...\r\nSuu: Just how many of them are there...?\r\nSuu: (What do we do; I'll get beaten at this rate... For Sayaka-san to help me, she'll have to...)\r\nYume Mimic: Aha! Ahahaha!\r\nSayaka: --!\r\nSuu: (...She doesn't have the room to be helping me. What now... I'm holding us back.)\r\nHayate: Are you okay, Suu-san?\r\nSuu: ...Honestly, we might be in a pinch here.\r\nHayate: Sorry, I wish I could back you up a little better...\r\nHayate: I'm no good with magic that takes fine control...\r\nSuu: Sure... Wait, fine control? Does that mean you're good at magic you don't have to control?\r\nHayate: That's how it goes.\r\nHayate: But, if I used that, you'd get caught up in it.\r\nSuu: Then, let's go with that!\r\nHayate: With that?\r\nSuu: Yeah! I'm just guessing, but I can probably use utsushi two or three more times... So getting hit with friendly fire's no problem!\r\nHayate: ...Are you okay with that?\r\nSuu: Of course I'm not okay with it!\r\nSuu: But... It's not just you, Hayate-chan... Nanoha-chan and Fate-chan too. All these girls even younger than me are trying so hard.\r\nSuu: Me being the only one looking pathetic... I'd hate that even more here.\r\nSuu: So... I'll be the bait, so fire away!\r\nHayate: Just one thing... You're not thinking of sacrificing yourself, are you?\r\nSuu: I haven't thought that for a second!\r\nHayate: ...Then, let's do it.\r\nHayate: I'm counting on you to round them up, Suu-san!\r\nSuu: Just watch me! If you're only looking for the best punching bag, I'm the number one toji!\r\nSuu: Please make it quick, while I still have utsushi up!\r\nHayate: Got it. Yagami Hayate! Hitting you with a big one!\r\nHayate: GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nYume Mimic: Uwah!? What was that!?\r\nSayaka: Suu! Hayate!\r\nHayate: I'm just fine. Suu-san is...\r\nSuu: ...I'm okay!\r\nSuu: The aradama went down... Yep! The punching bag strategy worked perfect!\r\nSuu: Hayate-chan! Leave the mimic aradama to me, and go back up Sayaka-san!\r\nHayate: Okay!\r\nSayaka: Now it's two on one.\r\nYume Mimic: Awww, just when it was getting fun, you had to come and ruin it.\r\nYume Mimic: Weaklings always bunch right up.\r\nHayate: Sayaka-san!\r\nSayaka: Mm!\r\nSayaka: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\n\r\nNanoha: Yeah, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan. Wait... Ah.\r\nNanoha: Raising Heart says it's done getting it ready!\r\nNanoha: We're waiting for you!\r\nKanami: Since you're not holding a phone, was that magic just now?\r\nNanoha: Yes, Kanami-san.\r\nNanoha: It sounds like Fate-chan and Hayate-chan succeeded in getting the Akabane swords, so they're coming our way now!\r\nKanami: You said something about something being ready...?\r\nNanoha: Right! It's our ace up our sleeve!\r\n\r\nFate: Nanoha-!\r\nHayate: Heeey!\r\nNanoha: Fate-chan! Hayate-chan!\r\nKanami: Satsuki-san, what do we do from here?\r\nYomi: We're going to the location where Ban-san and the other fake toji announced they would be taking the Akabane swords for testing.\r\nKiyoka: ...What if it's a trap?\r\nYomi: It's possible, but we have no other leads. \r\nSayaka: Understood.\r\nSuu: About that... I'm going to have to quit here.\r\nKanami: Suu-chan!?\r\nSuu: I only have one or two uses of utsushi left. If I went along like this, all I'd be doing is holding you back...\r\nSuu: So anyway, I'm leaving the rest to you, Hayate-chan.\r\nHayate: Okay! You can count on me, Suu-san!\r\nYomi: ...\r\nYomi: ...Etou-san, can I leave you in charge of the rest?\r\nKanami: The rest?\r\nYomi: Someone needs to guard the Akabane swords and Inami-san. Could I ask you to go on in my place?\r\nKanami: ...I got it. Let's go, everybody!\r\n\r\nSuu: They're gone now.\r\nYomi: With Etou-san and the others, it'll go fine.\r\nSuu: You're probably right...\r\nSuu: Thanks for staying behind for my sake, Satsuki-san.\r\nSuu: ...\r\nSuu: Aghh, it's kind of frustrating... If I were just a little bit stronger...\r\nYomi: Then, let's intensify your utsushi increasing program.\r\nSuu: Huh?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Our Magic\r\n\r\nKanami: This should be the place they were going, but...\r\n???: ...So there are shrewd ones among toji.\r\nKiyoka: Eh!? What's Suruga doing here!?\r\nSuruga?: Hoh. You've met with one who looks the same as myself? Yet, that one and I are different beings.\r\nSayaka: What were you doing with the Akabane swords?\r\nSuruga?: What? Merely to take your place.\r\nSayaka: Take our place?\r\nSuruga?: We attained toji. Then we would need okatana, would we not?\r\nKanami: Aradama taking the place of toji...?\r\nSuruga?: There are those among my kin who can mimic humans capable of polishing Akabane swords.\r\nSuruga?: Being which, would it not be amusing to wipe out the human toji and take their place?\r\nKiyoka: Aradama becoming toji, that's crazy...\r\nSayaka: It's not amusing.\r\nKanami: We aren't about to let you!\r\nHayate: You said it, Kanami-san!\r\nFate: If you replacing the toji means countless people have to be your victims, then we'll put a stop to it.\r\nNanoha: That's what our magic is for!\r\nSuruga?: End your barking, girl. What can one who is not a toji do?\r\nKanami:\u3000More mimic aradama!? Get back, Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan!\r\nNanoha: There's no need! Even if normal magic won't work on them, it's not like we can't still fight!\r\nFate: We found a way to fight!\r\nHayate: Showing for the first time here! Special anti-aradama magic!\r\nNanoha: Hayate-chan! Fate-chan! Let's go all at once!\r\nFate: Okay!\r\nHayate: On it!\r\nNanoha: React Annihilation Magic, Eraser Application!\r\nMagical Girls: BLAST SHOOT!\r\nSuruga?: Wha...\r\nKanami: That's amazing, Nanoha-chan!\r\nSuruga?: With one shot, my kin were... Amusing. I must respond in kind.\r\nKanami: There's so many aradama... But, if we have Nanoha and them helping us!\r\nNanoha: Right! Kanami-san! There's no way we'll lose!\r\nSuruga?: Then struggle to your last. I will offer as many as you need.\r\n\r\nSayaka: --!!\r\nFate: HAAAAHH!!\r\nSayaka: ...You really are fast, Fate. It's hard keeping up even with jin'i.\r\nFate: But you are keeping up with me, Sayaka-san.\r\nSayaka: You can go even faster.\r\nFate: I'll give all I have!\r\nSayaka: Me too!\r\nHayate: Ooh. Fate-chan and Sayaka-san sure are something. I can't go letting them show me up.\r\nHayate: Cla\u00edomh Solais!\r\nHayate: Alright!\r\nMimic Aradama: OOOOOOOOO!!\r\nKiyoka: Look out, Hayate-chan!\r\nHayate: Thanks, Kiyoka-san.\r\nKiyoka: Oh, it's nothing.\r\nKiyoka: I'll keep you safe, Hayate-chan, so just keep going!\r\nHayate: Sure! Leave it to me!\r\n\r\nNanoha:  Purge Shooter!\r\nNanoha: ...No matter how many we beat, more keep on coming out.\r\nNanoha: (Everyone's trying their hardest, but, at this rate...)\r\nNanoha: Kanami-san!\r\nKanami: HAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nKanami: What is it, Nanoha-chan?\r\nNanoha: I'll open up a path for you. So... Can I ask you to handle the rest?\r\nKanami: Got it, Nanoha-chan. I'll cut her down and exorcise her.\r\nNanoha: Please do, Kanami-san!\r\nNanoha: Raising Heart!\r\nRaising Heart: All right.\r\nNanoha: Mana Convergence! Soul... BREAKER!!\r\nSuruga?: Whah!?\r\nSuruga?: What is that power...! Kh...!\r\nSuruga?: Even guarding against it, I was pushed this far... Though, that wasn't enough to destroy me.\r\nKanami: YAAH!!\r\nSuruga?: Kgh!?\r\nKanami: I'm not giving you enough time to call more mimic aradama!\r\nSuruga?: A toji caught up with me...!?\r\nKanami: The time Nanoha-chan bought for me! I'm not letting it go to waste! \r\nKanami: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nSuruga: Gh...\r\nKanami: ...Did that do it?\r\nSuruga?: I enjoyed this, toji...\r\nKiyoka: Etou-san! The mimic aradama went away, but... What about Suruga!?\r\nKanami: Yeah, looks like I exorcised her.\r\nKanami: And that was all because of you, Nanoha-chan. Thanks.\r\nNanoha: I'm just glad we could defeat them before they could cause any major damage!\r\nSayaka: Your magic was beautiful, Fate.\r\nFate: Thank you, Sayaka-san. You were incredible too.\r\nKiyoka: Hayate-chan, did you get hurt anywhere?\r\nHayate: Nope, I'm fine. Thanks though.\r\nKiyoka: Alright. I'm glad I managed to protect you...\r\nKanami: Thanks a lot, really, Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan.\r\nMagical Girls: Sure thing!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1: I'm Not Lettin' That Go\r\n\r\nYomi: ...There are no longer signs of aradama in this location either. Takamachi-san, was there anything you found suspicious?\r\nNanoha: No, it looks alright to me.\r\nTsugumi: Okay, we're done here-. \"No issues in this location either\", there.\r\nNanoha: Uh...\r\nNanoha: Th-That's right, Tsugumi-san...\r\nTsugumi: What's wrong, Takamachi-san?\r\nNanoha: Actually, this is the place where I fought your mimic aradama with Kanami-san...\r\nTsugumi: Is that what happened?\r\nTsugumi: Even if it was just like me, an aradama is an aradama. Don't let it bother you.\r\nNanoha: I know that, but, it really was just like you...\r\nTsugumi: Did it resemble me that closely? Hmm, I would like to have been there then. What a shame.\r\nYomi: ...Let's put an end to this conversation and head back. Sanae-san and Harlaown-san, and Akira and Yagami-san, should be returning from investigating the other locations now.\r\n\r\nAkira: Yomi! What's the deal with this brat!\r\nYomi: Akira?\r\nFate: Did you do something with Akira-san, Hayate?\r\nHayate: Y'see, Akira-san looks like she's really packing, so I just wanted to see if I could check...\r\nAkira: No shit I wasn't gonna let you!\r\nHayate: And it went like this.\r\nFate: Ahaha...\r\nSanae: Satsuki-san. About the location I went to with Fate-san, there were no signs of aradama there.\r\nSanae: It didn't seem like Fate-san was able to pick up anything especially strange there either.\r\nYomi: Understood. What about you, Akira?\r\nAkira: ...Tch. It was the same for us; there's nothing there.\r\nFate: Hm? By the way... What happened to Nanoha? Wasn't she with you two, Yomi-san, Tsugumi-san?\r\nTsugumi: Takamachi-san should be back any minute. She was going to get something...\r\nNanoha: Ah, you already met up! Welcome back, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan.\r\nNanoha: ...Though, is it weird for me to say that when I'm the last one here?\r\nFate: Probably.\r\nFate: Welcome back, Nanoha.\r\nNanoha: Yeah. I'm back, Fate-chan.\r\nHayate: Tsugumi-san said you were getting something, so I guess that's it.\r\nNanoha: Yep!\r\nNanoha: Um, I wanted to offer you cakes! Let's all eat them together!\r\nTsugumi: Cakes?\r\nTsugumi: ...They looks delicious.\r\nSanae: I know. And so adorable too. Since you went and got them for us, I'll have one...\r\nSanae: Ah, it's tasty.\r\nAkira: ...\r\nYomi: Aren't you going to eat, Akira? You...\r\nAkira: Shut up, Yomi.\r\nYomi: ...\r\nAkira: (Damnit, there's no way I could eat cakes that look this cute!)\r\nAkira: (But it'd be such a waste if I don't... Okay. How do I go about eating one?)\r\nAkira: (Ahh, crap. I can't stop smiling.)\r\nNanoha: ...Um, Akira-san. Do you maybe not like cake?\r\nAkira: Huh?\r\nYomi: No, Akira...\r\nAkira: Didn't I tell you to shut it!\r\nYomi: ...\r\nAkira: ...It's not like I hate it. It's just, sorta... y'know.\r\nNanoha: ?\r\nFate: What's the matter?\r\nHayate: ...Ah.\r\nHayate: We weren't together all that long, but I can tell Akira-san's trying to look cool.\r\nFate: She wants to look cool?\r\nYume: Ah-! You look like you're eating something yummy! Lucky-! Gimme some!\r\nYomi: Do you want to have mine?\r\nYume: You already ate half of yours, Yomi-onee-san. So if that onee-san's not gonna have hers, I'll take it-.\r\nAkira: Huh? What're you talking about...\r\nYume: You're the only one who doesn't look like she's gonna eat, so it's fine, right?\r\nAkira: Hahh!?\r\nYume: [om nom]... Mm, so good!\r\nAkira: A-Ahh......\r\nAkira: ...You're gonna pay for that.\r\nAkira: I'm not letting this one go.\r\nAkira: I'm gonna teach you a lesson, Tsubakuro Yume!\r\nYume: Ehh!?\r\nYomi: (...Because Akira loves cakes.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Playing Tag\r\n\r\nAkira: Let's take this outside, Tsubakuro Yume!\r\nYume: ...Aha.\r\nYume: That means we're going to fight, right? You sure?\r\nAkira: Hah?\r\nYume: Onee-san, you know you're going to lose?\r\nAkira: Come try me then!\r\nSanae: Hold on a minute! Don't you think that's going too far over a piece of cake!\r\nAkira: Doesn't matter how big or small what she did is, Sanae.\r\nAkira: The point is, she did something she shouldn't. So I'm gonna teach her a lesson.\r\nAkira: That's all there is to it. You get that, right?\r\nYume: I don't really get what lesson you're going to teach me, but this seems fun so I'm fine with it.\r\nSanae: Just hang on a minute!\r\nSanae: Here, look! See how troubled you're making Takamachi-san after she brought the cake for us!\r\nNanoha: Uhh...\r\nAkira: That's... Well, I guess you've got a point.\r\nYume: Ah! I know about this cause I made sure to read the report!\r\nYume: Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan, Hayate-chan. You're all really strong, right?\r\nFate: She's looking at us like she wants to fight us... isn't she.\r\nHayate: (You're probably wanting to fight yourself though, Fate-chan...\r\nHayate: What are you going to do, Fate-chan?\r\nFate: ...I think I'm interested.\r\nHayate: Okay, in that case...\r\nHayate: (Hey, Nanoha-chan, Fate-chan.)\r\nNanoha: (What is it, Hayate-chan?)\r\nFate: (What do you have in mind?)\r\nHayate: (What do you think of this? See...)\r\n\r\nHayate: (Something like that.)\r\nNanoha: (Good thinking, Hayate-chan! That's a nice idea!)\r\nFate: (Yeah, let's go with that.)\r\nHayate: (Then it's settled.)\r\nHayate: Anyway, if that's how it is, what do you say we decide this with a game of tag?\r\nAkira/Yume: Tag?\r\n\r\nHayate: Alright, so I'll explain the rules.\r\nHayate: It's pretty simple.\r\nHayate: We'll split into two teams: Nanoha-chan, Yume-san, and Tsugumi-san, and Akira-san, Sanae-san, and me. First team to catch Fate-chan, who's it, wins.\r\nHayate: Fate-chan's gonna run with all she's got, so do all you can to get her!\r\nYume: If we can do all we can, that means we can fight, right?\r\nHayate: Sure. Fate-chan's tough.\r\nYume: Hmm, sounds neat. I'll be fighting Fate-chan, so you two can just watch.\r\nNanoha: Is that really going to be okay...?\r\nTsugumi: Tsubakuro-san says it's fine, so there shouldn't be an issue.\r\nTsugumi: I suppose our job is just at the start then-.\r\nNanoha: At the start?\r\nTsugumi: [whisper whisper whisper]\r\nNanoha: Ehhh!?\r\nHayate: That team looks like they're having fun. Let's give it our best shot too!\r\nAkira: I'm uh, sorry this turned into a whole thing. This all wouldn'tve happened if I'd just eaten the cake straight away.\r\nSanae: Maybe that's true, but Tsubakuro-san is also at fault for taking it from you.\r\nSanae: Let's try to win, Inago-san.\r\nAkira: Yeah, glad to have you, Sanae, Hayate!\r\nHayate: We're counting on you as the referee, Yomi-san.\r\nYomi: Understood.\r\nYomi: Is everyone ready? Then... Please begin.\r\nTsugumi: Takamachi-san, if you would.\r\nNanoha: Is this really okay... Uhh, I'm sorry for this! Bind!\r\nAkira: The hell is this!? I can't move!!\r\nYume: Ahaha! That's so cool!\r\nTsugumi: Now then, we'll be going on ahead-.\r\nNanoha:\u3000Bind will come undone soon! Sorry!\r\nHayate: Nnn, that's Nanoha-chan for you. She got us...\r\nSanae: Isn't there anything we can do about this?\r\nHayate: Nanoha-chan said it'd come undone soon, so I think we're better off waiting.\r\nHayate: In the meantime, we can talk strategy.\r\nSanae: Okay, that would make the best of our time.\r\nSanae: More than likely, Tsubakuro-san and them are probably going to find Harlaown-san first.\r\nSanae: Taking on both Harlaown-san and Tsubakuro-san... It'll be a little difficult, Inago-san.\r\nAkira: The question's, how can we hold down Yume. If we can take her out of the picture, we can figure out the rest...\r\nAkira: Wait, they've got Nanoha with 'em.\r\nHayate: You can just leave Nanoha-chan to me.\r\nAkira: Then that makes what comes after simple. We rush 'em when they're fighting Fate, and me and Sanae take out Tsugumi first.\r\nAkira: Then, we take on Yume like that. If it's 2 on 1 we should be able to manage.\r\nSanae: ...You're right that that seem like our best chance of winning...\r\nAkira: You don't like it?\r\nSanae: ...Kind of. If only I could stop Tsubakuro-san by myself, then you could focus on Harlaown-san, Inago-san...\r\nAkira: Tsubakuro Yume's tough. I don't even know how well I could do going at her on my own.\r\nAkira: That's why this is our best bet.\r\nSanae: ...Okay.\r\nHayate: Akira-san, you make yourself look like a delinquent, but you really are a nice person, huh.\r\nAkira: Shaddup. I just like this kinda fashion is all.\r\nHayate: You've got such a nice figure though. I bet you'd look good whatever you wear, so, why do you go with that?\r\nAkira: No real reason. Just, somebody I looked up to used to dress like this.\r\nAkira: ...Anyway, I can start moving around now. C'mon, let's go.\r\nSanae/Hayate: Alright!\r\n\r\nYume: Found you, Fate-chan! You two, don't get in our way!\r\nTsugumi: I know-.\r\nNanoha: Try your best, Yume-san.\r\nYume: Aha!\r\nYume: Okay then... Let's go, Fate-chan!\r\nFate: --!?\r\nFate: Sayaka-chan was fast, but... You're quick too, Yume-san!\r\nYume: You fought with Sayaka-chan?\r\nFate: With Sayaka-san and Kanami-san.\r\nYume: Huh!\r\nFate: They were both very strong.\r\nYume: Then, I've gotta let you know that I'm even stronger!\r\nFate: --!?\r\nNanoha:  Yume-chan, she's incredible... For the first time, someone's matching Fate-chan's speed...\r\nTsugumi: Tsubakuro-san is a special case, after all.\r\nTsugumi: Though... If Harlaown-san is evenly matched with Tsubakuro-san, she must be someone special as well.\r\nNanoha: Fate-chan is strong too.\r\nTsugumi: You sure do have faith in her-.\r\nTsugumi: Though, will you help support Tsubakuro-san now?\r\nNanoha: Sure!\r\nYume: Ahahaha! Is that all you've got, Fate-chan?\r\nFate: I can handle this. I can... get more serious!\r\nAkira: Tch, they're already going at it. Though... We finally caught up!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Are You a Sly Dog or What?\r\n\r\nAkira: Tch, they're already going at it. Though... We finally caught up!\r\nTsugumi: Oh, you came much faster than I was expecting.\r\nAkira: Oi oi, you got this much free time on your hands!\r\nTsugumi: That's not exactly it...\r\nAkira: Let's go, Tsugumi! ORAA!\r\nTsugumi: ...!?\r\nNanoha: Watch out!\r\nHayate:\u3000Not gonna let you, Nanoha-chan!\r\nNanoha: Hayate-chan!?\r\nHayate: I'll be your opponent here!\r\nAkira: Alright! You keep Nanoha company, Hayate!\r\nAkira: Sanae!\r\nTsugumi: So it came down to this... It'll be very hard fighting the both of you though...!?\r\nAkira: Try and see how long you can last!\r\nTsugumi: ...I'll try and last!!\r\nSanae: HAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nTsugumi: ......!!\r\nTsugumi: ...Ahh, you got me-. Well, there's no way I could stand up to that-.\r\nSanae: Don't think too badly of us, Ban-san. This is just part of the game.\r\nSanae: Inago-san! At this rate, Tsubakuro-san will...\r\nAkira: ...\r\nSanae: Inago-san?\r\nAkira: Just take a look at that.\r\nYume: Ahahaha! This is fun, huh, Fate-chan!\r\nFate: Yes... I'm having fun, Yume-san!\r\nAkira: ......Tch.\r\nAkira: Sorry for this, after we went and thought up our strategy. There's no way for us to break into that one-on-one.\r\nSanae: ...That's for sure.\r\nHayate: You sure do look after others a lot, Akira-san.\r\nAkira: Oh hey, Hayate. You beat Nanoha already?\r\nHayate: You looked like you were giving up on fighting, so we called a time out.\r\nAkira: Time out...? Well, whatever. You can put an end to that too.\r\nAkira: Let's just wait till these two are done fighting.\r\nHayate: Okaaay.\r\nTsugumi: ...Doesn't this mean I'm the only one who got beat up-?\r\nNanoha: Ahaha...\r\n\r\nYume: Ahh, that was so fun. Let's do it again, Fate-chan.\r\nFate: I'd be happy to do it anytime, Yume-san.\r\nYume: Great!\r\nYume: ...Wait, huh? What're you onee-sans doing?\r\nAkira: Waiting on you two to finish up your fight. Damnit, you took long enough my head cooled off.\r\nYume: What does that mean?\r\nAkira: I'm saying the stuff with the cake is water under the bridge.\r\nYume: Water under the bridge? I'm the one who fought Fate-chan first, so doesn't that make me the winner?\r\nAkira: Huh?\r\nAkira: ...Whatever, we're past that now.\r\nHayate: Mmhm, Akira-san's a big sister type; a real good girl.\r\nAkira: Oi, who're you calling a good girl? You're younger than me.\r\nHayate: A good girl is a good girl.\r\nHayate: And... For being such a good girl, I have a present for you.\r\nYomi: It seems the fighting is over.\r\nAkira: Yomi?\r\nAkira: Oh yeah, weren't you the ref? Where'd you go?\r\nYomi: I went to get this, at Yagami-san's request.\r\nYomi: It's fresh cake. Isn't that nice, Akira.\r\nAkira: ...What the hell.\r\nAkira: If you got more cake, there wasn't any point in playing tag, was there?\r\nHayate: We got to have a bit of fun though. It was fun, right?\r\nAkira: ...Yeah it was. Feels like we're all buddies now.\r\nAkira: So anyway, since there's more, let's head back and have some cake.\r\nYume: Sweet! Cake!\r\nAkira: Hah?\r\nNanoha: Don't worry, Akira-san! We made sure to get enough for Yume-san too this time!\r\nAkira: You did? Geez, who put you up to that... Wait, it was you, wasn't it?\r\nAkira: How long ago'd you think this up?\r\nHayate: When we offered to play tag. Cake was what got you two fighting, so cake would help you make up.\r\nAkira: I can't go taking my eyes off you, huh.\r\nHayate: Thank you very much.\r\nAkira: That wasn't meant to be a compliment...\r\nYume: What kind of cake do you like, Fate-chan?\r\nFate: I like...

We were working together just before this.\r\nNanoha: Yomi-san was actually with us too, but she had to go someplace else.\r\nFate: Is that how it happened. Let's do what we can, Nanoha.\r\nNanoha: Sure, Fate-chan!\r\nYume: So anyway, why're you just standing around doing nothing here?\r\nTsugumi: We were waiting for you, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Oh, you were? Then, you can go back and leave the rest to me, Onee-san.\r\nTsugumi: I probably could-.\r\nTsugumi: We won't go back, but I'll count on you to do your best.\r\nYume: Sure! \r\nFate: Umm... Is this going to be okay, Tsugumi-san?\r\nTsugumi: Is what okay?\r\nFate: The aradama... Isn't it going to be hard when they show up? I don't get that feeling from Yume-san...\r\nTsugumi: Tsubakuro-san is plenty strong though-.\r\nTsugumi: Since she doesn't struggle fighting aradama, there's not much sense of danger, so perhaps a part of her merely thinks of it as an extended game.\r\nFate: Then, why is it that Yume-san became a toji?\r\nTsugumi: Only Tsubakuro-san knows the answer to that.\r\nTsugumi:  Though... Everything will be fine.\r\nFate: Eh?\r\nTsugumi: Tsubakuro-san is a toji too. Please have faith in her.\r\nFate: ...Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mahou Shoujo - Yume: End]: It's Not Like That!?\r\n\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nYume: YAAH!\r\nAradama: Oooo...\r\nYume: Geez, there's nothing but weak aradama here!\r\nYume: How am I supposed to show Fate-chan how strong I am like this!\r\nFate: You don't need to go that far, Yume-san.\r\nFate: I think it's incredible how you can defeat aradama the moment we find them.\r\nYume: That's not really that incredible or anything.\r\nFate: ...\r\nFate: Why did you become a toji, Yume-san?\r\nYume: Ehh? To show people what makes me so strong.\r\nFate: What makes you strong?\r\nYume: Yeah. That's why, I thought I'd get to show you too, Fate-chan, but...\r\nYume: Wait, I know!\r\nFate: Yume-san?\r\nYume: Since we have the chance, let's have some fun while we do this... Fate-chan!\r\nFate: --!?\r\nYume: Aha! Fighting with you really is fun, Fate-chan!\r\nFate: We're in the middle of a mission right now!\r\nYume: Yeah! So, while we do the mission, let's fight, Fate-chan!\r\nFate: Kh... Stop this, Yume-san!\r\nYume: I'm not gonna!\r\nAradama: BGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nYume: You're in the way!\r\nFate: (Yume-san... She actually is defeating aradama while fighting me.)\r\nFate: (Showing others what makes her strong... Is that really so important to Yume-san?)\r\nYume: C'mon, c'mon! What's wrong, Fate-chan!\r\nFate: --! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nAradama: ooooo...\r\nFate: I'll be your opponent, but I'll only attack the aradama...\r\nFate: Will that be alright?\r\nYume: ...Aha! It's fine with me!\r\nTsugumi: Okay, that's enough-.\r\nYume: Ehhh!? What're you and Nanoha-chan doing here, Onee-san?\r\nTsugumi: We heard something troubling going on, so we hurried over.\r\nNanoha: Fate-chan, if you're going to fight with Yume-san, I think you should do it after the mission's over...\r\nFate: Y-You've got it all wrong, Nanoha! I was making sure to do the mission!?\r\nYume: Geez, and it was just getting fun too. Let's pick up from here when we get back, Fate-chan.\r\nNanoha: Fate-chan can get pretty intense when it comes to combat training...\r\nFate: I told you, it's not like that!!"}, {"paste_key": "G0U9Ncxe", "title": "Nitta Hirona Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/G0U9Ncxe", "timestamp": "", "hits": "76", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/ZOBxjHGGX8w\r\n\r\n1: The Type I'm No Good With\r\n\r\nMimi: Hirona-onee-san! Come play with Mimi-!\r\nHirona: ......Sigh, this again. [muttered]\r\nMimi: Huh? Maybe she didn't hear me? Are your ears feeling stuffed up? Hey, Hirona-onee-san?\r\nHirona: ...I can hear youuu.\r\nMimi: I'm glad you can hear me then!\r\nHirona: (.........Sigh. Because of Kagami-san, I haven't been able to do things according to plan lately.)\r\nMimi: Hey hey hey hey! Come play with Mimi, Hirona-onee-san!\r\nHirona: .........\r\nHirona: (Why exactly is she so attached to me... It's not like I did anything with her... Hmm.)\r\nHirona: ...I have an aradama suppression mission today, so we can't play.\r\nMimi: Really? That's too bad...\r\nMimi: Then, when'll we get to play, Hirona-onee-san!\r\nHirona: ...It's hard to sayyy.\r\nHirona: (...Though, I don't think that day is ever cominggg.)\r\n\r\nMimi: Hirona-onee-san, let's make sure to play tomorrow!\r\nHirona: (......She's even doing this in the dormmms?)\r\nHirona: ...Kagami-san, do you not have friends?\r\nMimi: Huh? I do?\r\nHirona: ...Then I think it would be better if you left me alone and played with them.\r\nMimi: You're my friend too, Hirona-onee-san, so it's all alright!\r\nMimi: And anyway, you can just call me Mimi, Hirona-onee-san!\r\nHirona: ......No thank youuu.\r\nMimi: Why not!?\r\nHirona: (...Because if I'm looking after you, my efficiency will go down.)\r\nHirona: (I don't want to get any less efficient...

I have a sort of bad feeling about this...)\r\n\r\nMimi: Fooound you, Hirona-onee-san!\r\nHirona: ...Kagami-san, your voice is too loud.\r\nHirona: (I thought that I wouldn't see her if I adjusted my time in the library...)\r\nHirona: Why did you think I would be here?\r\nMimi: When you weren't in the classroom, I just looked everywhere around school.\r\nHirona: ...Didn't you think I could have gone home early?\r\nMimi: Nope! Cause, you're Hirona-onee-san after all!\r\nHirona: (......That's not a reasonnn.)\r\nHirona: (Still... Kagami-san's impulsiveness is completely outside my ability to plan around.)\r\nHirona: (......Instead of being indirect, it might be faster to to say it straight here.)\r\nHirona: ...Kagami-san. Please don't come up to me anymore. You're bothering me.\r\nMimi: Yeah, I hear that a lot! Like, Mimi, you're a little troublemaker!\r\nHirona: ......Didn't I say you were bothering me?\r\nMimi: But, I still like you, Hirona-onee-san, so I'm gonna come see you!\r\nHirona: ......\r\nHirona: (Calling it \"innocence\" sounds better, but... this girl just doesn't listen to people...)\r\nHirona: ...Sigh. Fine then, do what you want.\r\nMimi: You mean it!?\r\nHirona: ...Trying to get rid of you was less efficient.\r\nMimi: Hooray!

She could wear something cool or something cute just fine.\r\nYui: The more lightly dressed the better!\r\nKiyoka: That's rejected.\r\nYui: ...Awww.\r\nMihono: Ahaha!\r\nMihono: Hmm, which would look good on Hirona... Ah, I bet Kohime'd like this one!\r\nMihono: I'm going to go buy it real quick!\r\nYui: You're totally in love with Kohime-chan, aren't you, Mihono-chan! It's so precious it hurts though!\r\nHirona: ......It sure is.\r\nMihono: I'm back-. Okay, so what should we do?\r\nKiyoka: I want to have a short strategy meeting first, so how about we find something to eat?\r\nYui: Like crepes?\r\nKiyoka: Crepes...\r\nYui: What's wrong, Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKiyoka: I've been a little worried about my waistline recently... You know, it'll be summer soon, and then...\r\nMihono: Ahh, cause of swimsuits.\r\nYui: But I'd still like you if your belly's a little soft, Kiyoka-chan.\r\nKiyoka: I don't care if you'd like it...\r\nYui: That's so mean!? But I like that too!!\r\nHirona: ...\r\nMihono: Ah, sorry, Hirona! We sort of got off-topic, didn't we.\r\nHirona: ...No, it's fun just listening to you three talk.\r\nMihono: ...Is it though?\r\nHirona: It is.\r\nMihono: (Still, we came to hang out with the four of us, so I want Hirona to be having a good time too.)\r\nMihono: (Okay, I'll come up with something for Hirona to talk about!)\r\nHirona: ...\r\n\r\nHirona: ...Ah, Musumi-san. I really like that outfit thereee.\r\nKiyoka: Oh, it's so cute. I think I like it a lot too.\r\nYui: You two should try it on! I'll be waiting for you!\r\nHirona: ...But you're planning on peeping, aren't youuu?\r\nYui: She found me out!?\r\nMihono: Wait, huh!? Hirona naturally worked her way into the conversation!?\r\nHirona: ...What do you take me for? I know the flow of your conversations, so I can join in.\r\nHirona: ...Actually, Asakura-san, were you thinking of looking out for meee?\r\nMihono: ...You noticed?\r\nHirona: It seemed like something you'd dooo. But changing the flow of the conversation would leave odd pauses, so isn't that less efficient?\r\nHirona: That's why I tried joining in now and thennn.\r\nMihono: Then you could've just joined in from the start!?\r\nHirona: Sorrrry about that. Even when I wasn't talking, the conversation was still moving smoothly, sooo.\r\nMihono: ...Does anybody ever tell you you're strange, Hirona?\r\nHirona: ...How did you knowww? For some reason, I get told that sometimes.\r\nMihono: No, I think the reason's pretty clear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: My Hero\r\n\r\nYuuki: Hirona-san, are you busy later?\r\nHirona: ......I'm availableee.\r\nYuuki: Then, let's make an appointment to go shopping in half an hour!\r\nHirona: Okaaay.\r\nAkira: ...\r\n\r\nThat evening...\r\n\r\nAkira: Yo, Hirona.\r\nHirona: .........Oh, Akira-san. Did you need somethiiing?\r\nAkira: You go along with whatever Yuuki asks you, don't you.\r\nHirona: I do?\r\nAkira: Yeah.\r\nAkira: But you're all about efficiency. And you actually had some plans today, didn't you?\r\nHirona: I did, but Yuuki-san took higher priority.\r\nAkira: Hmm.\r\nAkira: I never asked, but, did something happen between you and Yuuki?\r\nHirona: Something with... Yuuki-saaan?\r\n\r\nHitakami Toji 1: Huh!? Nitta-san's in the same unit as us for this mission!?\r\nHitakami Toji 2: Didn't the last unit Nitta-san was part of break up after she stabbed them in the back?\r\nHirona: .........\r\nHirona: (......It's not like I turned on them because I wanted to stab them in the back.)\r\nHirona: (It was just more efficient that way... Though I doubt they would listen if I explained that.)\r\nHitakami Toji 1: Hey, Nitta-san.\r\nHirona: .........Yes?\r\nHitakami Toji 2: Do you think we could work separate from each other? So long as we suppress the aradama, it doesn't matter.\r\nHirona: .........\r\nHirona: Alriiight. That would be more efficient, wouldn't ittt.\r\nHitakami Toji 1: Thanks.\r\nHirona: (You don't have to sound so relieved... I wouldn't turn on anyone in a normal suppression assignment.)\r\nHirona: ...Well, I can do this more efficiently on my own thoughhh.\r\n\r\nHirona: [pant pant]...\r\nAradama: GYAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nHirona: --! HAAHH!!\r\nAradama: GYOHHHHHHHHHH!\r\nHirona: .........More of them, againnn.\r\nHirona: (This is as hard as you'd expect... I wonder how those two are doing...)\r\nAradama: OOOOOOOOO!\r\nHirona: Kgh!?\r\nHirona: [pant pant]...\r\nHirona: This isn't the time to worry about others, is ittt..\r\nHirona: (I really won't be able to keep fighting any longer... I'd like to find some way of escaping, but...)\r\nHirona: ...The problem is, which do I go withhh.\r\nHirona: (If I stay here, things will only get worse...)\r\nHirona: All or nothing... Is that what it comes down tooo. Sigh, how inefficient...\r\n\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\r\nHirona: ...This was a bust, wasn't it.\r\nAradama: GAOOOOOOOOOOO!\r\nHirona: Grgh...!?\r\nAradama: GYAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nHirona: (Is this it...!?)\r\nYuuki: HAAAAAAAAAAH!!\r\nYuuki: Are you okay!?\r\nHirona: ...Yuuki-san? Why are you here...?\r\nYuuki: When you were the only one who didn't come back, I asked the other two what happened, and they said you were acting on your own.\r\nYuuki: So I came looking for you.\r\nHirona: ...Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nHirona: ...And that's how it happened.\r\nAkira: Huh, way to go, Yuuki.\r\nHirona: (......Well, that story should be enough to satisfy Akira-san-.)\r\nHirona: (Though, the truth is I owe her something much harder to repay... But that's not something I'd tell anyone.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Determination\r\n\r\nAradama: GYAOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nToji A: The aradama are attacking!!\r\nToji B: Why're there so many aradama!? Wasn't this just a noro retrieval mission!?\r\nToji A: Worry about that later! We're pushing them back!\r\nHirona: .........\r\nToji C: Nitta-san! Quit spacing out and draw your okatana!\r\nHirona: ...Understoood.\r\nToji: ...Get ready, Nitta-san. Aradama... they won't go easy on you cause you're new!\r\nHirona: ...Got it.\r\nToji A: Here they come!\r\n\r\nHirona: Gh... Urkh...\r\nRescue Party: There's another toji collapsed over here!\r\nRescue Party: Hey, are you okay!?\r\nHirona: ......My body hurts.\r\nRescue Party: We'll get you to a hospital right away! Just hang in a little longer!\r\nHirona: ......What about my senpais?\r\nRescue Party: ...You had the least severe injuries.\r\nHirona: ......That's not efficient at all...\r\n\r\nHirona: ............\r\nHirona: .........Being hospitalized suuure is boring.\r\nMiyako: In that case, mind if I borrow some of your time?\r\nHirona: .........You're my senpai, aren't you? Who are youuu?\r\nMiyako: Sasano Miyako, from the research course. Good to meet you, Nitta-san.\r\nHirona: .........It's nice to meet you.\r\nHirona: ...Oh? Am I wrong, or is your left arm...\r\nMiyako: It is. It happened... a long time ago.\r\nMiyako: Your mission this time, it was difficult for you all, wasn't it.\r\nHirona: ......It was.\r\nMiyako: The kind of thing you'd call inefficient, right?\r\nHirona: .........Yes. Actually, it's because nothing about that mission was efficient.\r\nHirona: ...Ah. Does that count as criticizing the head of the Origami family?\r\nMiyako: Maybe. I think it'd be best not to say much about that.\r\nMiyako: Though... It was interesting talking to you. Anyway, I'll see you around.\r\nHirona: ...Goodbye.\r\nHirona: ......What was that about, anyway?\r\n\r\nHirona: ...After being away from school for so long, I get called right away by the president. Sasano-san might have reported me.\r\nHirona: Excuse me.\r\nSana: You're here.\r\nMiyako: It's been a while.\r\nHirona: .........\r\nHirona: Sasano-san, did you report meeee?\r\nMiyako: If I had to say one way or the other, I guess I did?\r\nMiyako: Though, it's not in a bad way.\r\nHirona: ...Ah, then you aren't mad at me. In that case, it's alllright.\r\nSana: She's a funny one.\r\nMiyako: I thought you might like her. ...What do you think?\r\nSana: Sure, I don't see why not.\r\nSana: I'm going to get straight to the point... Nitta, do you want to join Mokusa?\r\nHirona: Mokusa?\r\nSana: Mokusa opposes Origami Yukari... It's an organization formed to oppose the revisionists led by Origami Yukari, with the intent of restoring okatana and toji to the state they should be.\r\nSana: Nobody's going to force you, but... You want to change the way things are now too, don't you, Nitta?\r\nSana: What do you say?\r\nHirona: ............\r\nHirona: Alright thennn.\r\nHirona: Toji being injured is inefficient, sooo. If it improves our situation, I'll joiiin.\r\nSana: ...I had a feeling you'd say that.\r\nSana: Nitta, there's somebody out there with similar opinions to yours. Do you want to go meet them now?\r\nHirona: With similar opinions to mine... I want to meet them. Could you tell me their name for nowww?\r\nSana: Sure. Her name is... Hitakami Makoto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: An Inefficient Method\r\n\r\nMakoto: Have you finished preparing for your trip to Okinawa?\r\nHirona: ......Yeeep, I'm ready to go-. I have my summer clothes and swimsuit with meee.\r\nAkira: Your swimsuit? You know you're not going there for fun, right?\r\nHirona: ...I know thaaat.\r\nHirona: But, I won't know what I'll need, and couldn't the target I'm observing say she wants to go to the beach?\r\nYuuki: This great aradama the Sword Administration Bureau is safeguarding... Her name was Kohime? Would great aradamas really be interested in things like going to the beach?\r\nMakoto: If it were Tagitsuhime, surely she wouldn't.\r\nHirona: ...I think she might because of Asakura-san's influence. She became attached to Asakura-san.\r\nAkira: Cause of Mihono then...\r\nAkira: Damnit, now that Mihono's started showing those powers, I really don't want to be giving up somebody trustworthy.\r\nMakoto: This observation mission in Okinawa is also something we could only leave to someone we can trust.\r\nHirona: ......\r\nHirona: ...Please leave Okinawa to meee.\r\nAkira: I get all that, okay.\r\nAkira: Ahh, fuck it! Things just can't go our way, can they!\r\nMakoto: Akira-chan?\r\nAkira: I'm going for a ride to clear my head!\r\nMakoto: I suppose that's the end of that.\r\nYuuki: What are you going to do now, Makoto-nee-sama?\r\nMakoto: I'm sure that Akira-chan will be back in time for dinner, so I'll get the food ready.\r\nMakoto: Hirona-san, you should stay and eat with us today.\r\nHirona: ...Thank you very muuuch.\r\nHirona: It's the two of us now. What will you do, Yuuki-san?\r\nYuuki: I'm going to do my secret training. You should join me, Hirona-san!\r\n\r\nYuuki: HAAAAAAAAAAH!!\r\nHirona: ...\r\nHirona: (Once I'm in Okinawa... I won't be able to join Yuuki-san for a while.)\r\nYuuki: YAAAAAH!\r\nHirona: ...Oh, I lost, didn't I.\r\nYuuki: Hirona-san! Please stay focused! I have to... I have to train to be even stronger!\r\nYuuki: Please go another round with me!\r\nHirona: ...Okaaay.\r\nHirona: (If Yuuki-san wants to be stronger... Becoming a tamayori toji would be the efficient thing to do.)\r\nHirona: (But...)\r\nYuuki: YAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nHirona: Nh...\r\nHirona: That was a good strike just now.\r\nYuuki: You mean it!?\r\nHirona: ...I wouldn't want that, would I.\r\nYuuki: Hirona-san?\r\nHirona: ...Just talking to myseeelf.\r\nHirona: ...More importantly, let's go another round, before you forget the feeling of that strike.\r\nYuuki: Okay! If you'll have me!\r\nHirona: (It might be inefficient... but I think training like this is what's right for Yuuki-san.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Hirona Joins: Start]: Time For a Contest!\r\n\r\nYuuki: The three of us haven't gone on a mission for a while, have we, Akira-nee-sama, Hirona-san!\r\nAkira: Yeah, now that you mention it, that's right.\r\nAkira: It's mostly the same for me, but Hirona's not around a lot.\r\nHirona: ......\r\nHirona: Were you talking about meee?\r\nAkira: You seriously move at your own beat, y'know that?\r\nYuuki: We were just saying, it's been a while since the three of us were on a mission together.\r\nHirona: ...I think you're right.\r\nHirona: But, it's mostly Akira-san's fault that I'm busy, isn't it-?\r\nAkira: I'm just the one telling you your missions!\r\nHirona: Ehh, but there's missions from you too, aren't there?\r\nAkira: They're not from me, they're from Makocchan!\r\nYuuki: That's just proof that they trust you! And I trust you too, of course!\r\nAkira: That's how it is.\r\nHirona: ...It all depends on how you put it.\r\nHirona: Well, since Akira-san is here today, I'm going to take it easy. That'll be most efficient.\r\nAkira: Quit trying to make things easy just for yourself!\r\nHirona: I'd like to save my energy for when it really matteeers.\r\nAkira: Hahh!? Then I'm gonna work you whether you like it or not!\r\nAkira: Yuuki, Hirona! We're making this a competition to see who gets the most aradama! Last place buys dinner!\r\nYuuki: We're competing!? Bring it on!\t\t[Yuuki uses Akira's catchphrase]\r\nHirona: ...If Yuuki-san is fine with it, it's okay with me too.\r\nAkira: No backing out then!\r\nAkira: I'm not about to let you beat me, Yuuki! Hirona!\r\nYuuki: I won't lose either!\r\nHirona: ...\r\nAkira: ORAAH! Onnne! Twooo! Threee!\r\nYuuki: HAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nHirona: You two are working very hard.\r\nHirona: ...Then, I'll go at it efficiently too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Hirona Joins: End]: Fighting Efficiently\r\n\r\nHirona: ...The aradama readings sure are going away surprisingly quickly.\r\nHirona: Though...\r\nHirona: The biggest reading is this way.\r\nHirona: I don't think I'll be able to beat Akira-san in numbers, but I can hunt big game efficiently hereee.\r\nLarge Aradama: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nHirona: That's a big one-.\r\nHirona: Then...\r\nHirona: I'll just defeat you-.\r\nLarge Aradama: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nHirona: ...\r\nLarge Aradama: OOAA!?\r\nHirona: ...Are you surprised I avoided that? That slow attack won't hit me.\r\nLarge Aradama: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nHirona: HMPH-!!\r\nLarge Aradama: GYAAAAAAAAAAAAA...\r\nHirona: ...That's all there is to it. Now, I can go back.\r\n\r\nAkira: Huhh!? You just got a single one!?\r\nHirona: Yes. Though, I beat the one that seemed strongest.\r\nYuuki: So Hirona-san was big game hunting!\r\nHirona: I worked hard efficientlyyy.\r\nAkira: So you went for quality over quanity...? Damnit, what do we do now.\r\nYuuki: Nee-sama had quanity, Hirona-san had quality... Either way, I came in last.\r\nHirona: ...Judge, please decide. Which of us won?\r\nAkira: ...Sigh. You're saying that cause you know how I am, aren't ya?\r\nAkira: No matter how many weak aradama you beat, they're all just the same!\r\nHirona: Hooray-. In that case, you'll buy dinner for Yuuki-san and meee.\r\nAkira: Hah!?\r\nYuuki: Hirona-san!? But I'm the one who came in last!?\r\nHirona: The one who came up with it didn't come in first, so it's the same as coming in last.\r\nAkira: You've got some real nerve... No other way around it! You two eat whatever you want! It's on me!\r\nHirona: Got iiit.

Is there even a point to that?\r\nMakoto: There is.\r\nMakoto: By equipping noro onto themselves, a tamayori toji is able to render attacks from aradama on the same level as that noro ineffective.\r\nMakoto: With this, it's possible to dramatically reduce the risk of injuries among toji.\r\nExpert: I-Is that right?\r\nMakoto: It is.\r\nMakoto: And, of course, it provides not only defense, but also enhances their attacks.\r\nMakoto: Okatana and noro. A toji making use of both can prove exceptionally effective against aradama.\r\nAnnouncer: That's amazing.\r\nExpert: But, even so...\r\nMakoto: The perception of noro as something dangerous is an outdated belief.\r\nMakoto: We have already successfully fused aradama with toji. I firmly believe tamayori toji will be the model of the future of toji, able to keep everyone safe.\r\nAnnouncer: Well then, why don't we move to a demonstration of how incredible tamayori toji are in practice.\r\n\r\nChie: ......\r\nMirja: Tamayori toji are yet again the focus on television today.\r\nEllen: Apparently grandpa offered to be on this debate they're showing.

I was careless and let myself get sick...\r\nYuuki: I was thinking I had somehow been feeling tired lately...\r\nMakoto: There's no need for you to worry over it, Yuuki-chan. Please just have a nice long rest.\r\nMakoto: Once you're better, I'll be depending on you again.\r\nYuuki: ...Okay.\r\nAkira: ......\r\nAkira: The hell, Yuuki. If you're catching colds, you must've not been training enough. You better be ready when you get better, alright?\r\nYuuki: ...Sure!\r\nAkira: So, rest up now. As far as your missions go...

What'd you do?\r\nYomi: I have eyes always watching around you. I've noticed several times your and Toribane-san's eyes turning red.\r\nAkira: Tch, well shit.\r\nAkira: So you've seen this then.\r\nYomi: Please stop using aradama for combat.\r\nAkira: You're one to talk.\r\nYomi: No one besides me... should have to use this power. Please suspend all research into tamayori toji.\r\nAkira: I made up my mind to deal with this. Besides, the effects aren't as bad as putting noro right in your body like myouga.\r\nYomi: But it is having an effect. Are you still going to hold to those words?\r\nAkira: Course I am.

Can I be next to you on the way there? You don't mind, right!\r\nMirja: Do what you want.\r\nMirja: More importantly, Morishita Kihiro. Let's go over once more what will happen when we get there.\r\nMirja: Firstly, as I'm in charge of reaching out to visitors...\r\nKihiro: Ahh, we lied about that.\r\nMirja: Huh?\r\nYui: Hey!? It's too soon to spill the beans!!\r\nMirja: ...Too soon to spill the beans. And what do you mean by that, Yamashiro Yui?\r\nYui: Well, uh, we didn't lie so much, Mirja-san. Loosely speaking, we do want you attracting visitors...\r\nMirja: Haji Keiko?\r\nKeiko: M-Me!?\r\nKihiro: Please don't glare at Miss Haji like that, Miss Kitora. She was saying we should give a proper explanation until the bitter end.\r\nMirja: ...Right, I think I have an idea of what's going on. Yamashiro Yui is behind this, isn't she?\r\nYui: Teheh.\r\nMirja: \"Teheh\" doesn't make up for this.\r\nKihiro: To give a perfectly crisp and clear explanation, we'd like you to be a race queen for us, Miss Kitora!\r\nMirja: A... race queen.\r\nMirja: So, what are you making me wear?\r\nYui: Ehehe! Take a look, Mirja-san! This is it!\r\nMirja: To sum it up... I wear this, sit on the motorcycle, and attract people...\r\nKihiro: As a staff member attracting visitors in the broadest sense, you're our billboard.\r\nMirja: ...\r\nKeiko: I-I'm sorry... We were actually going to hire a professional to do this...\r\nKihiro: You see, while building the motorcycle, my gen~ius instincts went and caught fire.\r\nKihiro: And, while remodeling here and there, we completely spent through our budget.\r\nYui: That's when I happened to hear about all this, and thought, why not ask Mirja-san?\r\nYui: With your bombshell body, there's no way you wouldn't look great in it!\r\nMirja: ...Unbelievable.\r\nKeiko: Um... Are you not going to do it afer all...?\r\nMirja: No, I will. I wouldn't turn you down after coming this far. I'm not happy about it, but all I can do is resign myself to this...\r\n\r\nCameraman: Excuse me-. Would you mind giving a look over this way-?\r\nMirja: Li... like this?\r\nCameraman: Thanks a lot! That's perfect!\r\nMan: Hey, check out the cowling on that bike...! The design, materials, functionality; they're all first rate.\r\nWoman: I can tell. And, the parts used here...! That's an interesting make, but what purpose does it serve? Hmm, I'd really like to find out.\r\nKihiro: Mmhm! Just as we'd planned, Miss Haji! Our motorcycle is the center of attention!\r\nKihiro: Now then! Let's hurry over and give our guests an explanation!\r\nKeiko: Right...! I'm very glad, that we worked so hard on this assignment...!\r\nMirja\uff1a (...From the sound of it, this motorcycle has incredible workmanship. That at least makes it worth me enduring the shame of dressing as a race queen.)\r\nMirja: (Though--)\r\nYui: Hey, Mirja-saan~! Could you look over my way too~! And be extra sexy for me, please~!\r\nMirja: (Sigh... Instead of guiding visitors, Yamashiro Yui is just enjoying herself. I'll have to lecture her thoroughly later...)"}, {"paste_key": "tKG9zbhs", "title": "5-5 Time Won't Stop", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/tKG9zbhs", "timestamp": "", "hits": "695", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/U6oZ1x4iqDM\r\n\r\n1: Where I Belong\r\n\r\nMihono: ...I'm back!\r\nTsugumi: Welcome back, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: Tsugumi-san! And...\r\nMihono: This room hasn't changed one bit, huh.\r\nKofuki: Well duh, why would it change?\r\nMihono: Shut up, Fukki! You're ruining the moment!\r\nKofuki: What, were you feeling like crying again?\r\nMihono: Th-That's not what I'm saying!\r\nChie: ...Fufu, how about I pour us some tea? Kiyoka-chan, can you give me a hand?\r\nKiyoka: Sure!\r\nYui: I'll help out too-.\r\nKofuki: I'll take some milk-.\r\nTsugumi: Ah, if you mean the milk you bought before, Shichinosato-san, there's none left.\r\nKofuki: Huh!? Where'd it go!\r\nTsugumi: It was nearly the expiration date, so I drank it.\r\nKofuki: There was still some time left, wasn't there!? And hey, if you drank it, then buy me a new one!\r\nMirja: That's enough talking about milk. It's time we discussed the issue at hand.\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono. Can you tell us about what happened with Hitakami Makoto?\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: I can.\r\n\r\nMihono: Umm, after all the things they said, my head's honestly a mess right now...\r\nMihono: But, if Hitakami-san's telling the truth, then... there's a great aradama inside me.\r\nEveryone: !?\r\nKiyoka: ...Do you mean that, Hono-chan?\r\nMihono: When Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power was rampaging... That was really all the powers of this great aradama called Kanayamahime.\r\nKiyoka: ...\r\nChie: ...Hey, Mihono-chan?\r\nChie: Why did... Makoto know all this...?\r\nMirja: ...I'm wondering the same.\r\nMirja: In whichever records we looked, there was nothing pertaining to Kashuu Kiyomitsu or the Asakura family.\r\nMirja: Where did Hitakami Makoto find this information?\r\nMihono: It sounds like she's... a distant relative of mine. Hitakami-san's and my family... Apparently, we used to be the Atago family...\r\nMirja: Atago... you say?\r\nMihono: And apparently, five hundred years ago, a miko from the Atago family sealed the great aradama in her own body.\r\nMihono: That great aradama got passed down all this time by the Atago... the Asakura family...\r\nKofuki: So then, why's it waking up now? Wasn't it fine for five hundred years?\r\nMihono: ...\r\nKiyoka: Does it have something to do with the tip of Kashuu Kiyomitsu breaking off...?\r\nMirja: ...It's difficult to say anything in our current situation. We don't have enough information to draw any conclusions.\r\nMirja: At any rate, our immediate next step should be to verify the factuality of what we've learned. Not everything Hitakami Makoto said may necessarily be true.\r\nChie: We'll do something about this, whatever it takes. I promise I'll get you through this, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee...\r\nChie: So please... Don't do anything reckless again. Promise me...\r\nMihono: ...Mm. I promise.\r\nYui: Hey hey, let's leave the serious talk at that and switch over to talking about our sleepover!\r\nMihono: Our sleepover?\r\nKiyoka: That's right!\r\nKiyoka: You've been looking down lately, haven't you, Hono-chan? So we were talking about buying a bunch of snacks and having a sleepover with everyone.\r\nKofuki: Won't have to worry about breaking your wallet either, Mihocchi. Cause Chichie and Mirja are paying, right?\r\nMirja: That was our agreement.\r\nKofuki: See?\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMihono: Fukki... Thanks.\r\nKofuki: For what?\r\nMihono: ...I dunno? But, I felt like I should tell you.\r\nKofuki: Alright then.\r\nTsugumi: Asakura-san, while they prepare for the sleepover, could you come along with me for a bit?\r\nTsugumi: Kanayamahime... I think I could get good data from that.\r\nKofuki: Could you try to read the mood?\r\nTsugumi: To have Shichinosato-san tell me that...\r\nTsugumi: Though, it's captured my interest, so I don't think there's anything I can do about it?\r\nKofuki: Do something about it!\r\nMihono: Ahaha!\r\nMihono: (Good... Everybody's still the same as always. As long as they're here, I know it'll be alright.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Phone Call\r\n\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMirja: ......! This one is the old maid, isn't it!\r\nMihono: Ahh!?\r\nMirja: That finishes it.\r\nMihono: Uwaahhh!? I lost again-!!\r\nKofuki: You suck at this, Mihocchi... And hey, we ran out of drinks.\r\nChie: Now's a good time, so let's take a break.\r\nYui: Ah, then, I'm going to step outside for a minute-.\r\nKofuki: Go buy us something to drink while you're at it-.\r\nYui: Sure thing-.\r\n\r\nYui: ...Phew. Alright, I've gotta make sure to let her know.\r\nHana: ...What is it?\r\nYui: It's been a while, Hana-san. I thought you weren't going to pick up.\r\nHana: It didn't seem like it was ever going stop ringing. ...What did you need?\r\nYui: I didn't need anything, it's more like... I had to tell you something? It's about Mihono-chan.\r\nHana: What about Mihono?\r\nYui: ...Do you know what the Hitakami faction is?\r\nHana: That came out of nowhere... Though, I've heard the name before at least.\r\nYui: Well, it seems like they're getting into experiments like with the Myouga toji project.\r\nHana: Myouga......\r\nHana: What does that have to do with Mihono?\r\nYui: While you haven't been here, there's seriously been so much that's happened...\r\nYui: So much that it'd take too long to get it all out.\r\nHana: ......\r\nYui: ...Hana-san, whatever happens, you'll be there for Mihono-chan, right?\r\nHana: Yui?\r\nYui: I'm sorry... It's just... Whenever things calm down, it's like it all comes over me...\r\nYui: Maybe it's because I heard your voice, I guess.\r\nHana: ...What happened?\r\nYui: Please give me an answer.\r\nHana: ......Of course I will.\r\nYui: There's a great aradama, Kanayamahime, sealed inside of Mihono-chan's body.\r\nHana: !? An evil god... like with Yukari-sama and Hiyori-san...!?\r\nHana: What about Mihono!? Is she alright!?\r\nYui: For now, she's still doing okay. But...\r\nYui: ...Come back to us, Hana-san. We can help Mihono-chan together!\r\nHana: I...\r\nHana: I'm sorry.\r\nYui: Hana-san!\r\nHana: ......Just give me a little longer. I promise... I'll be back.\r\nHana: So just, give me a little more time...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: A Private Conversation (1)\r\n\r\nChie: They're fast asleep now, aren't they. Even though they were so noisy all night.\r\nMirja: They must be tired. After all that's happened, I can't blame them.\r\nChie: Though, this works out well. There's something I wanted to talk about with you.\r\nMirja: It's about Asakura Mihono, isn't it.\r\nChie: ...What Makoto said... about Kanayamahime. Do you think it's true?\r\nMirja: This is only my personal opinion, but...\r\nMirja: That power going rampant... I find it easier to accept it as the power of an evil god than the power of an okatana.\r\nChie: That... makes sense.\r\nChie: What exactly... should we be doing? What could we do, to support Mihono-chan...\r\nMirja: ......\r\nMirja: There are too many unknowns right now that I don't know where to begin solving it.\r\nMirja: Let's ask for support from those around us while continuing to search through the records.\r\nMirja: And, while this may be coming too late, we need to keep close watch for any changes in Asakura Mihono...\r\nChie: How is that any different from what we were already doing!? That's what made Mihono-chan go to Makoto for help!\r\nChie: ...Ah. I'm sorry, for raising my voice.\r\nMirja: ...You don't need to apologize. I feel the same as you.\r\nMirja: However, we are also responsible for what happened with the Hitakamis, by allowing Asakura Mihono to move freely. We can't allow ourselves to make the same mistake again.\r\nChie: I know. Next time, I'll be there for Mihono-chan, no matter what.\r\nMirja: ......It isn't good to be overly eager about it either.\r\nChie: But, if this goes on and the great aradama awakens, there's no doubt Mihono-chan will be a target for suppression.\r\nMirja: ...It would come to that, wouldn't it. As a great aradama, Asakura Mihono would be threat to humanity.\r\nChie: I'm not going to let her end up like Yukari-sama did.\r\nMirja: ...We won't.\r\nMirja: First, we should look to the judgment of our superiors. ...Though I'd rather not. I wish I could keep this from being reported.\r\nChie: Even you're feeling that way, Mirja?\r\nMirja: Of course I am. What do you think of me?\r\nChie: Sorry, it's just a little unexpected.\r\nMirja: ...I understand that would only be running away from the issue, but I don't want this to become known by anyone.\r\nMirja: The response to Asakura Mihono carrying Kanayamahime is not going to be a lenient one...\r\nChie: ......\r\nChie: ...I'll help look through the records with you.\r\nMirja: That would help.\r\nChie: Do you think that... there's any way to pull Kanayamahime out of Mihono-chan, or make the seal stable?\r\nMirja: It's a slim chance to hope for. However, it's all we can do.\r\nMirja: That, and one more thing...\r\nChie: What's that?\r\nMirja: Should we remove Asakura Mihono from her duties?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: A Private Conversation (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Does that mean... you're taking me off the investigation team?\r\nMihono: But I don't want that! I want to stay with the team!\r\nMirja: Please calm down.\r\nMihono: Hey, say something too, Chii-nee!\r\nChie: Listen to us, Mihono-chan.\r\nChie: We aren't saying to take you out of the investigation team. It's the opposite.\r\nChie: We want you to support us, so that you can still stay in the investigation team.\r\nMihono: ...What does that mean?\r\nMirja: Going about it this way has two benefits. The first is... for political reasons.\r\nMihono: Political?\r\nMirja: Information about Kanayamahime will be reported to the government by the Sword Administration Bureau.\r\nMirja: That's where they would decide how to deal with you.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMirja: We want to lower your chances of being re-assigned somewhere besides the investigation team as much as we can.\r\nMirja: The fact that the investigation team has chosen this option, and that you would abide by it, shows the investigation team is trying to minimize the risk of the great aradama awakening.\r\nMirja: I am not sure if this is the best option... But, we want to do whatever we can, no matter how small.\r\nMihono: (The government...? The conversation's gotten so big my head's spinning...)\r\nMihono: (Umm... The government won't want the great aradama to wake up. That's what I want too...)\r\nMihono: (If that's the case, then... They might think it'd be better if I wasn't with the investigation team... Wait?)\r\nMihono: (Would it be better if I left...?)\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: What's the second one?\r\nChie: For practical reasons... We can buy a little more time for you.\r\nChie: The more time we have to find a solution for you, the better.\r\nChie: Though, you might be feeling worried in the meantime...\r\nMihono: (Chii-nee and Mirja-san are both thinking really hard of how I can stay in the investigation team...)\r\nMihono: (But...)\r\nMihono: Would it be better if... I wasn't in the investigation team?\r\nChie/Mirja: That's not true!/That isn't the case!\r\nMihono: ......\r\nChie: Please, Mihono-chan. At least until we can find a way to deal with this...\r\nChie: I want you to wait and believe in us.\r\nMihono: ......Okay.\r\nMihono: (It's alright. I know I can believe in you.)\r\nMihono: I'll be here to support you then!\r\nMihono: (I know they'll come up with a good idea, won't they...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: I'm Not Giving Up (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: I was always wondering. Why I was seeing this dream.\r\nMihono: I thought it was Kashuu Kiyomitsu showing it to me, but that's not it.\r\nMihono: You're Kanayamahime, aren't you?\r\nMihono: Why are you doing this to me?\r\nMihono: Give me an answer!!\r\nMihono: -!?\r\nMihono: You're attacking me? Now that I know what you are, you don't care what happens anymore?\r\nMihono: KYAH!?\r\nMihono: Uuu... This is just... too much...\r\nMihono: ...!?\r\nMihono: Urgh... The power, feels like it's going to burst out of me...\r\nMihono: I can't...! I can't lose control, not here...!\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan!? Are you okay in there, Mihono-chan!?\r\nMihono: Kanami?\r\nKanami: You're still conscious, aren't you?\r\nMihono: Yeah...\r\nMihono: Sorry, just give me a minute... If I move... right now...\r\nHiyori: Keep a strong grip on yourself!\r\nMihono: Juujou-san...?\r\nHiyori: Don't worry, we're here with you. So just focus on keeping your power in check.\r\nMihono: ......Okay.\r\n\r\nMihono: ......Okay, I'm fine now, I think.\r\nMihono: Sorry you had to wait, Kanami, Juujou-san! I'll unlock the door now.\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan... Are you fine now?\r\nMihono: ...Yeah.\r\nKanami: ...Thank goodness.\r\nHiyori: I was having breakfast with Kanami when something felt wrong.\r\nHiyori: I hoped we'd have come over here for nothing, but...\r\nMihono: ...\r\nHiyori: We've heard about how Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power is rampaging.\r\nMihono: Huh!?\r\nHiyori: I got a call from Kiyoka. She said you were in trouble. Asking if I knew anything that could help.\r\nKanami: And Kaoru told me, if I knew anything, I should go tell it to you.\r\nKanami: Mai-chan too, she said Sayaka-chan asked her about it.\r\nKanami: We're all worried about you, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: ......!\r\nMihono: (Kiyoka... Thanks, everybody.)\r\nMihono: ............\r\nMihono: Inside of me, there's a great aradama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: I'm Not Giving Up (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: ............\r\nMihono: Inside of me, there's a great aradama.\r\nMihono: The two of you noticed something, right? That's why you came here all panicked.\r\nKanami: I had a kind of bad feeling about this... But I hoped it wouldn't be that...\r\nHiyori: The power of a great aradama... It's not something a person can keep under control. If it's not Kashuu Kiyomitsu, but a great aradama's power that you're losing control of... That explains what you're so worried about.\r\nMihono: ...Yeah.\r\nHiyori: A great aradama isn't something someone can resist for years and years. If that great aradama wakes up in you... If you can't keep a firm resolve, you won't be able to hold onto yourself.\r\nMihono: ............\r\nHiyori: ...Ah, I'm sorry. This isn't something you need to be hearing right now.\r\nMihono: No, I get it...\r\nMihono: It's just... Why did all this have to happen...\r\nKanami: This great aradama, it was always with you, wasn't it, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah...\r\nKanami: Would it be possible... for you to try getting along with it, or something?\r\nMihono: I don't really know, but...\r\nHiyori: I won't tell you that's impossible, but... I don't agree with the idea. The moment the great aradama awakens, it's possible Mihono's sense of self will be snuffed out. You shouldn't take this lightly.\r\nKanami: Ah... Sorry.\r\nMihono: It's alright! I know that you're thinking about how to help me, Kanami!\r\nHiyori: Mihono. Was there anything passed down for times like these, to deal with the great aradama?\r\nMihono: ...I don't think there is.\r\nHiyori: I see. Though, you should try asking at least.\r\nMihono: O-Okay, I'll ask Grandpa about it.\r\nHiyori: And also... Don't give up hope.\r\nMihono: Huh?\r\nHiyori: The unease you're feeling... I know it too well.\r\nHiyori: But, you have friends with you. The investigation team, and us too, we'll do everything we can to help you.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan's right! We'll look and see if there's some way to stop this too!\r\nMihono: ...Thanks, Kanami, Juujou-san.\r\nHiyori: Sure.\r\nHiyori: (But, if it comes down to it, I'll be the one to...)\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: ...It's nothing. Anyway, we were in the middle of breakfast, weren't we?\r\nMihono: ...Ah, my stomach started rumbling as soon as you said breakfast.\r\nHiyori: It's better if you can stay that relaxed for now. I know it must be hard, but don't dwell on it too much.\r\nMihono: ...Okay.\r\nKanami: So then, let's all have breakfast together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Spreading Ripples\r\n\r\nAkane: Now then, Maki-san, Yomi-san, Yume-san. Please give your report on the Hitakami faction.\r\nAkane: It was already reported to me that the Hitakami faction is attempting to produce \"tamayori toji\"; toji with aradama equipped to their bodies...\r\nMaki: Yes, we engaged in combat with what we believe was a tamayori toji. It didn't seem like they've perfected it, but it definitely raises a toji's overall capabilities.\r\nMaki: It's just...\r\nYukari: What is it?\r\nYume: It was like she'd turned into some kind of monster.\r\nYukari: ......\r\nChie: Excuse us.\r\nKaoru: ...\r\nMaki: Setouchi Chie and Mashiko Kaoru?\r\nAkane: I called them here, thinking we would need information on Mokusa's side as well.\r\nMaki: Do they know the situation?\r\nYukari: We'll tell them what they need to know.\r\nKaoru: Tamayori toji... Is it true they're doing experiments fusing aradama and toji?\r\nKaoru: I'd heard the Hitakami faction was doing research on strengthening toji, but this tamayori thing...\r\nKaoru: Are Akira and them seriously doing that?\r\nMaki: It's the truth.\r\nMaki: We personally fought with a toji we think was subjected to those experiments.\r\nYomi: ...\r\nChie: And they tried forcing Mihono-chan... Asakura Mihono to help with their research.\r\nKaoru: ...Why Mihono? Because of that power she got from Kashuu Kiyomitsu?\r\nMaki: That power of Asakura Mihono's...?\r\nChie: That's...\r\nAkane: I'll tell them.\r\nAkane: Asakura-san's power stems from the great aradama, Kanayamahime. As it goes, the great aradama Kanayamahime has been passed down for generations through the eldest daughters of the Asakura family.\r\nMaki: A great aradama!?\r\nYume: You mean, like Tagitsuhime?\r\nYukari: That's correct.\r\nChie: ...\r\nMaki: I propose having Asakura Mihono give up her okatana.\r\nMaki: We can't allow the Hitakami faction to have her either, so she'll need guards... We can do that.\r\nChie: Wait! You're saying you'll make Mihono-chan quit being a toji!?\r\nMaki: That's right. It's only a temporary measure, but, if this is as dangerous as with Tagitsuhime, it's something we'd better do.\r\nChie: That's going too far!\r\nChie: We already took into account the risk of her losing control and had her pulled off of any missions!\r\nMaki: That's just turning a blind eye to the heart of the problem. So long as there's a risk of the great aradama awakening, there's steps we need to take.\r\nAkane: Please calm down, both of you. As for what should be done with Asakura-san... I will give you my answer on behalf of the Sword Administration Bureau.\r\nAkane: Asakura Mihono will continue to be left with the investigation team. However, the next time she shows signs of rampancy, we will immediately place her under confinement.\r\nChie: Confinement...\r\nAkane: This is a government issued directive and will not be altered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: The Reason Behind Her Decision (1)\r\n\r\nAkira: I'm against this. Let's stop the final experiments on tamayori toji.\r\nMakoto: Akira-chan...\r\nYuuki: I want you to rethink this, Makoto-nee-sama.\r\nMakoto: Yuuki-chan...\r\nMakoto: Having failed to win over Asakura Mihono, a descendant of the Atago family, I am the one left with the highest compatibility.\r\nMakoto: As someone with blood ties to the Atago family, this is something I must do... Please understand that.\r\nAkira: We've already heard all that.\r\nAkira: Anybody closest to the Atago family has the highest compatibility for tamayori. That's why somebody from the Hitakamis like you has the best shot, right?\r\nAkira: But, since Yuuki and me are related to the Hitakamis, that means we should be plenty compatible.\r\nAkira: Am I wrong?\r\nMakoto: ...\r\nAkira: This isn't something you can laugh off!\r\nYuuki: ...We're serious about this.\r\nYuuki: Why can't you just tell us to be tamayori test subjects! Please, Makoto-nee-sama!\r\nYuuki: All you have to do is say that, and we would gladly do it for you!\r\nMakoto: ...\r\nMakoto: (That's the very reason I can't tell you that, Yuuki-chan.)\r\nMakoto: ...You know, don't you?\r\nMakoto: If someone incompatible is forced through the experiment, rather than equipping onto the body, the aradama becomes fused to the flesh...\r\nAkira: Do you not get it yourself?\r\nAkira: If that's what'll happen to us, then an experiment with you is bound to fail too.\r\nAkira: And, if there's a chance it'll work for you, then there's just as much a chance it'll work for us!\r\nAkira: So let us do it!\r\nMakoto: ......Among the three of us, I am still the most compatible. Which makes this something I need to do.\r\nMakoto: (So another tragedy like that can never be repeated...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: The Reason Behind Her Decision (2)\r\n\r\n--Five years ago.\r\n\r\nChie: I didn't think we'd come under attack from aradama...... Captain! Let's retreat for now and re-organize!\r\nCaptain: Don't lose your nerve, Setouchi! We aren't retreating... We can't retreat here!\r\nChie: But, with this many of them! \r\nCaptain: The head of the Origami family gave orders to recover noro without fail!\r\nSasano Miyako: The head of the Origami family, then...\r\nChie: Miyako...\r\nMiyako: That puts us in a bind.\r\nMiyako: She's normally more composed... But she can't go against the head of the Origami family, can she.\r\nChie: Still, there's more of them than our unit can handle.\r\nMakoto: Chie-san... Miyako-san...\r\nMiyako: You don't have to look so worried. I'll get you through this, Makoto.\r\nMakoto: I-I'll be fine! I'm a toji myself!\r\nMiyako: And I feel better having you here.\r\nMiyako: ...Chie, keep an eye on the captain.\r\nChie: I will.\r\nChie: ...Makoto.\r\nMakoto: Yes!\r\nChie: Be careful not to get separated from Miyako... Once we're home safe, we can wind down with a nice long bath.\r\nMiyako: That's a death flag, you know?\r\nMiyako: ...Look after yourself, Chie.\r\nChie: You too.\r\n\r\nMakoto: MIYAKO-SAN! MIYAKO-SAN!!\r\nMiyako: ......\r\nMakoto: The bleeding won't stop... Why did, we even take this mission...\r\nAradama: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nMakoto: Gh!\r\nMakoto: LEAVE US ALONE!\r\nMakoto: If... If Miyako-san isn't treated soon...\r\nMakoto: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUGHHHHHH!!\r\n\r\nMakoto: Over at last... Miyako-san, I have to...\r\nMakoto: Ngh, my vision's fading...\r\nMakoto: I can't, faint here...\r\nMakoto: Need to take Miyako-san...\r\nMakoto: ............\r\nChie: Miyako! Makoto! Where are you!?\r\nChie --!!\r\nChie: G-Get a medical team right away...\r\nMakoto: (Chie-san's voice...? Thank God... Miyako-san...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: The Reason Behind Her Decision (3)\r\n\r\nMiyako: You don't need to come and visit me this often, Makoto.\r\nMakoto: But... it's because of me... If I had been stronger...\r\nMiyako: If you hadn't been there, I would have died. No one is blaming you; I'm grateful for what you did.\r\nMakoto: ...\r\nMiyako: ...Really. Chie, won't you say something to her too?\r\nChie: I've been telling her. But... you see.\r\nMiyako: ...I guess she can't help it.\r\nMiyako: Makoto.\r\nMakoto: Y-Yes!\r\nMiyako: I'm feeling a little thirsty. Sorry, but could you go buy me something to drink?\r\nMakoto: Right; I'll buy you something right away!\r\nChie: Aren't there drinks in the fridge here? ...Was there something that's difficult to say with Makoto in the room?\r\nMiyako: Yeah. It'd be better if she didn't hear about this for now.\r\nMiyako: ...It looks like this is it for me.\r\nChie: ...!!\r\nChie: Isn't there something they can do...?\r\nMiyako: My right eye, I can hardly see with it. I can tell whether it's bright or dark, but that's it.\r\nMiyako: And... Mm... I can't move my left arm. When something touches it too... I can't feel anything.\r\nMiyako: It's like... it's not even a part of me...\r\nChie: Miyako...\r\nMiyako: Sorry... We won't be fighting together anymore.\r\nChie: Why... are you the one apologizing...\r\nMiyako: You were doing so well holding it in... Don't cry now...\r\n\r\nMakoto: Miyako-san won't be a toji anymore...\r\nMakoto: This is my fault... Because of me...\r\nMakoto: If I... had been stronger... No... that's not enough...\r\nMakoto: If toji... could be stronger...\r\n\r\nMakoto: At that time, I realized it.\r\nMakoto: The ideology Mother promoted, of strengthening toji and reducing the number who fell victim to aradama, was by no means wrong.\r\nAkira/Yuuki: ......\r\nMakoto: In the beginning, even though it was called the desire of the Hitakami faction, I never felt it for myself.\r\nMakoto: But, after what happened then...\r\nMakoto: I understood Mother's grief... Having lost so many of her friends at the Great Disaster of Sagami Bay. The injuries she suffered there leaving her with no choice but to give up her life as a toji.\r\nMakoto: I would make sure that Mother's... and my desire became a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: As the Family Head (1)\r\n\r\nMakoto: I would make sure that Mother's... and my desire became a reality.\r\nAkira: You're just jumbling things up and spouting off excuses... That's not you!\r\nMakoto: Eh?\r\nAkira: I'm sayin', the choice you're making here, nothing about it sounds like something you'd do, Makocchan!\r\nAkira: You'd know this better than anybody. The head does what the head does, and the hands've got their own part to play.\r\nAkira: You're the head here!\r\nAkira: If the head gives out, we're done for.\r\nAkira: Not to doubt the people giving us this tech, but don't take any chances!\r\nAkira: That's how we've done things, right!?\r\nMakoto: Then, you'll be the one to... Is that it?\r\nAkira: See, you do get it. That's what makes sense.\r\nYuuki: That's no fair, Akira-nee-sama.\r\nYuuki: We were both convincing her, so why are you taking the best part for yourself in the end!\r\nAkira: It's cause it's the best part that I want it all for me.\r\nAkira: Figure that out, dummy.\r\nYuuki: I don't like that!\r\nYuuki: If you're getting into the good stuff, I want you to share it with me too. That's how... we've done things.\r\nAkira: No big sister's gonna force their little sister into something crazy. Could you just let me look good here?\r\nYuuki: But little sisters try to be like their big sister. We're ride or die.\r\nAkira: Don't go trying to make yourself sound slick. I bet you just picked that one up anyway...\r\nAkira: ...Do you really get it? You're riskin' more than me with this.\r\nMakoto: ......\r\nAkira: What happens if yours is the only one that screws up?\r\nYuuki: I don't care. \r\nAkira: Quit acting like you're tough. Care some.\r\nYuuki: I don't care!\r\nYuuki: Because, even if my experiment fails, Makoto-nee-sama won't leave me like that, will she?\r\nMakoto: You know that I wouldn't. Whatever it took, I would help you.\r\nYuuki: See. Makoto-nee-sama can take care of that.\r\nYuuki: But... Akira-nee-sama I wouldn't be able to. Am I wrong?\r\nMakoto: Ah...\r\nAkira: Not wrong at all. Yeah, you hit the nail on the head.\r\nAkira: Don't go crying if yours fails, alright?\r\nYuuki: I won't! \r\nAkira: Sorry, but we've made up our minds.\r\nAkira: You're a real softie, Makocchan. Deep down, you'd never want to use us for this... or anybody really.\r\nMakoto: ...You're right. I thought, if the experiment could succeed with me... that would be the best approach.\r\nAkira: But we don't want that. Let us off for being selfish on this.\r\nYuuki: We're sorry about this, Makoto-nee-sama!\r\nMakoto: ...Apologizing doesn't make it bother me any less.\r\nAkira:  Well, if we screw up, just put that towards the next experiment.\r\nAkira: Then it works out fine.\r\nMakoto: ...You sure are pushy. But, I really will do that, alright?\r\nMakoto: There's lots of things that are going to hurt, you know?\r\nYuuki: So long as you're the one doing them, I don't mind!\r\nAkira: I'd be pissed if you didn't make good use of it.\r\nAkira: ...I've seen my own share of toji getting hurt, from place to place. Even if I didn't know them, it's hard to stomach.\r\nAkira: That's why I don't think a single thing wrong with what you believe in, Makocchan.\r\nMakoto: Akira-chan... Do you feel that way too, Yuuki-chan...?\r\nYuuki: ...I haven't ever experienced anything like the both of you have.\r\nYuuki: If I keep going as a toji, that might someday happen to me... But, it hasn't yet.\r\nYuuki: So my reason is a little different from Akira-nee-sama's.\r\nMakoto: ...\r\nYuuki: I want to be useful.\r\nYuuki: I hate that I can't do anything for Makoto-nee-sama like this. I hate that Akira-nee-sama is always the one protecting me.\r\nYuuki: I want you to depend on me too. Please let me be there for you.\r\nYuuki: Let me protect you along with Akira-nee-sama.\r\nMakoto: ............\r\nMakoto: Alright then.\r\nMakoto: The test subjects will be altered to both Inago and Toribane!\r\nMakoto: This experiment always comes accompanied by a risk of failure! Though... Even if this were to fail, I have no doubt a new future for toji will be waiting beyond your sacrifice!\r\nMakoto: Until I reach that future... I will never stop pressing forward.\r\nAkira: Sure!\r\nYuuki: Right!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: As the Family Head (2)\r\n\r\nMakoto: It seems it's going to take a little more time before the experiment is finished being adjusted for two people.\r\nAkira: If we have time, that works for me.\r\nAkira: So hey... What's going to happen with Mihono?\r\nMakoto: Just as I told Asakura-san. Her life won't be able to return to the way it was.\r\nAkira: Yeah, that figures.\r\nMakoto: Kanayamahime's existence will have been reported to the government.\r\nMakoto: With the Year-End Disaster being fresh in their minds, they would harbor strong misgivings towards Asakura-san.\r\nMakoto: I have no doubt they'll put her under confinement for one reason or another. Though, I can't say for certain what will come after that...\r\nAkira: That's fine; I get the idea. They're just gonna sweep it under the rug, aren't they?\r\nYuuki: ...I want to help out Mihono-san.\r\nMakoto: ...I would too. If she had come over to the Hitakami faction, we could have done something for her...\r\nMakoto: Along with that... I have two concerns.\r\nAkira: ...There's more to this?\r\nMakoto: The officials who go against me... They'll surely try to get Asakura-san for themselves.\r\nYuuki: They'd go and do that...?\r\nMakoto: That's how much value Asakura-san... her Atago blood carries.\r\nMakoto: Thinking towards the future... Asakura-san's assistance will be vital in curing the toji who have given themselves up to the tamayori experiments so far.\r\nAkira: ...What's the other thing on your mind?\r\nMakoto: Kanayamahime... looks to be awakening faster than I'd assumed.\r\nAkira: --!\r\nAkira: Is that it!? The reason you're pushing forward with the final experiments right now!\r\nMakoto: It is; one of the main reasons.\r\nMakoto: Should that time come, tamayori toji will be the ace up our sleeve.\r\nAkira: So it's the power to kill Mihono.\r\nMakoto: To harm others, regardless of her own intentions... Do you think Asakura-san would be able to bear that?\r\nAkira: ...She wouldn't.\r\nAkira: That's how Mihono is.\r\nMakoto: With a tamayori toji's power, you could even defeat a great aradama. I'd ask you to prove that by cutting down Asakura-san.\r\nAkira: ...Alright.\r\nYuuki: Makoto-nee-sama...\r\nMakoto: ...This is only in the worst case scenario.\r\nMakoto: I would hope it doesn't come to that...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: Frustrating Days\r\n\r\nSayaka: ...Mai.\r\nMai: What is it, Sayaka-chan?\r\nSayaka: I heard... about Mihono.\r\nMai: ...Oh.\r\nSayaka: Mihono, will she be okay?\r\nMai: She has Setouchi-san and Kitora-san... The whole investigation team is trying everything they can for her, so I'm sure she'll be fine.\r\nSayaka: ...\r\nMai: ...It's frustrating not being able to do anything, isn't it.\r\nSayaka: Cookies...\r\nMai: ?\r\nMai: Are you feeling hungry?\r\nSayaka: That's not it.\r\nSayaka: I want to make cookies to give to Mihono. It would make her feel better.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan...\r\nMai: You're right.

It hasn't been long since we were put in the special defense team.\r\nMaki: Let's keep ourselves focused.\r\nSuzuka: Of course.\r\nSuzuka: Even seen favorably, the special defense team is simply a re-organizing of the old Origami family elite guard.\r\nSuzuka: There are still those keeping a harsh eye on us now, so all we can do is to continue producing results.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: I don't see any... responses to aradama.\r\nMaki: Doesn't seem like there's any around here.

Why the troubled face?\r\nMaki: Oh, Suzuka.\r\nMaki: There's a lot of toji using VR for training lately, right?\r\nSuzuka: It seems that way.\r\nMaki: It's good broaden people's options for training. But... I'm wondering if there's anything else we can use VR for.\r\nSuzuka: ...\r\nMaki: Suzuka?\r\nSuzuka: I just never expected to hear that from someone as technologically inept as you.\r\nMaki: I'll admit I'm a little bad when it comes to using gadgets. But, it's impressive, wasn't it?\r\nMaki: So it just crossed my mind.\r\nSuzuka: I do agree it's an interesting idea. I'll see if I can think of anything too.\r\n\r\nMaki: A PV?\r\nSuzuka: Yes. A promotional video for toji, with a play staged in VR.\r\nMaki: A play...?\r\nSuzuka: I called it that, but we won't actually be acting out roles.\r\nSuzuka: Something more of a staged sword fight, you could call it.\r\nSuzuka: When I consulted with Ban-san, she said it would be feasible, so long as she recorded the fighting and edited the footage.\r\nMaki: So she just needs us to fight then... Alright, that plan sounds good.\r\nMaki: We should be able to make it happen.\r\nSuzuka: I've already given Ban-san the go ahead.\r\nMaki: You always get things rolling.

Should we go over how we plan to fight?\r\nMaki: How? Aren't we going to fight like normal?\r\nSuzuka: There wouldn't be much appeal in that. Given that we're in VR, I think we should use this opportunity to fight differently.\r\nMaki: Differently from normal...\r\nTsugumi: If I can collect different combat data than your ordinary battles, I'd very much welcome that too.\r\nMaki: Alright, I'll try coming up with something. How about, using the buildings to fight?\r\nMaki: Suzuka.\r\nSuzuka: To move about three-dimensionally? It sounds interesting.\r\nMaki: We're going to move up to the top of this building, so start whenever you feel the timing's right.\r\n\r\nMaki: Yoh, hoh!\r\nVillain: !!\r\nMaki: Spotted the enemy!

What do you need?\r\nYume: Have a fight with me.\r\nYukari: I don't have time to entertain you now. Though... If we can do it here, I'll keep you company.\r\nYukari: Come whenever you're ready.\r\nYume: Whenever I'm ready... When should I...\r\nYume: Go!\r\nYukari: ...\r\nYume: You dodged that!?\r\nYume: ...Ahah! This time, I'll do something even more ama-- zing!\r\nYukari: To make me draw my okatana...... That is impressive.\r\nYume: If we didn't get this far, we'd both be bored, right, Yukari-sama?\r\nYume: So then, I'll do even more-!\r\nYume: That's what I want, Yukari-sama-!\r\nYukari: ...It's about time now. Sorry, Yume.\r\nYume: Uwah!?\r\nYukari: That's all for today.\r\nYume: J-Just one more time! If I don't beat you, they won't let me go on any sorties!\r\nYukari: Where did you get that idea? The reason you go on so few sorties is because Shidou and Konohana are concerned about your body.\r\nYume: Huh...? ...But, they never told me about that.\r\nYume: And anyway, Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san worry way too much!\r\nYukari: You shouldn't say that.\r\nYume: But still...\r\nYukari: ...Yume. You put up a fine attack. I'll play with you again, so stay diligent.\r\nYume: Okay!\r\nYume: (Ahh, that was so fun! I'll get even stronger next time, and then I'll even beat Yukari-sama!)\r\nYume: ...I'm really glad I joined the elite guard!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/QcrxhLnr7t8\r\n[1,001 Nights - Yume: Start]: A Request\r\n\r\nMaki: Excuse us, Yukari-sama.\r\nYukari: You're here. I have a request for you from the Sword Administration Bureau.\r\nSuzuka: A request?\r\nYume: Is it aradama!? Yukari-sama, did a really tough aradama show up!?\r\nYukari: ...That's not it. This request comes from the public relations department.\r\nYume: Really-? What a letdown-.\r\nYomi: What sort of request is it?\r\nYukari: You've been requested to participate in an indoor pool's event.\r\nYume: But there's no point in us going, is there?\r\nYukari: Don't say that, Yume.\r\nSuzuka: Listen to Yukari-sama, Yume. This too is fine work for the elite guard.\r\nYume: Then you onee-sans can go do it on your own.\r\nMaki: Yume! Don't act so spoiled.\r\nYukari: Then, Yume. After you finish this request, I'll be your opponent. It's been a while.\r\nYume: You mean it!? Then, I guess I have to go.\r\nYume: But, you have to promise, Yukari-sama! You can't go saying you take it back after this!\r\nYukari: Good. I promise.\r\nYomi: Is that alright?\r\nYukari: It's not too much to ask. And...\r\nYume: Yesss-! I finally get to fight against Yukari-sama-!\r\nYukari: If she's that happy about it.\r\nYomi: ...I see.\r\nMaki: Yukari-sama, can you share with me the details of the event? I'll have to get notes ready in advance for the speech.\r\nSuzuka: Wait, Maki-san. I'll take care of that.\r\nMaki: Thanks, Suzuka. I'm leaving it to you.\r\nSuzuka: Of course; you can rely on me.\r\nYukari: Though, about your assignment this time... You won't be part of a ceremony.\r\nYukari: You will be giving a dance performance as part of the pool's Arabian event.\r\nYume: Eh...!?\r\nYume: Instead of listening to some boring speeches at a ceremony, we're dancing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1,001 Nights - Yume: End]: A Promise for Next Time \r\n\r\n--The day of the event.\r\n\r\nMaki: We have to wear these!?\r\nYume: You don't like it, Maki-onee-san? They're so cute though.\r\nMaki: Look how much stomach it shows... I can't wear something that cute!\r\nSuzuka: Yes... It's embarrassing for me as well. \r\nYume: Why don't you want to wear it that bad though?\r\nYume: It doesn't really feel like something you'd say, Maki-onee-san. You'd be more like, \"All clothes are the same-!\"\r\nMaki: ...I don't think all clothes are the same.\r\nMaki: And I'm just... a little self-conscious about my stomach.\r\nYume: You mean cause it'll be cold?\r\nMaki: That's not it.\r\nMaki: ...Isn't my stomach way too toned compared to everybody?\r\nSuzuka: My, were you really worried about that?\r\nYume: You're a real workout monster, Maki-onee-san-.\r\nYomi: We're out of time, everyone. Please hurry and change.\r\nYume: Okaaay.\r\nSuzuka: So she says. Time to find your resolve, Maki-san...\r\nMaki: But... Gh, I guess this is a mission too!\r\n\r\nYume: Hmhmhmm~! And, turn here!\r\nYume: Ahaha! I didn't think dancing would be this fun!\r\nMaki: You were the one who didn't want to do this the most at first, Yume, and now you're having the most fun with it.\r\nSuzuka: Isn't it charming to see her act her age?\r\nMaki: ...That's true.\r\nYume: Geez! Maki-onee-san, you're messing up the rhythm.\r\nMaki: Huh!?\r\nYomi: ...\r\nYume: Yomi-onee-san, you've gotta smile more!\r\nYomi: ...Was I not smiling?\r\nYume: You haven't smiled for a second-!\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, an event like this isn't so bad, is it, Yume.\r\nYume: Yeah!

We have to go to the beach on the map straight away!\r\nAkira: Nah, first we're stealing the maps offa Yui and Suu! Loot and plunder! Cause we're pirates right now!\r\nMihono: Oh, yeah! The rules said we can do that too, didn't they.\r\nYomi: It seems only one team has the correct map to begin with.\r\nYomi: If we board the other ships and lower their pirate flag, they have to give up their treasure map.\r\nAkira: If we get all the maps, our odds of finding the treasure go up. And it sounds more fun than just going around looking, right?\r\nMihono: Yeah! It's totally more exciting!\r\nYomi: There is a time limit, so please don't forget that, you two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pirate - Akira: End]: Alriiight, We're Boarding!\r\n\r\nAkira: Yo, wanna have a little fun with us?\r\nAkira: Give us a minute and we'll get your flag down.\r\nYomi: That's how this will be, so excuse us.\r\nAkira: You gotta get more aggressive at times like these.\r\nYomi: ...That's not how I am.\r\nEllen: We were planning on picking a fight ourselves, but we were beaten to the punch.\r\nKiyoka: That's mostly Captain Yui's fault though!\r\nKiyoka: And also, where's Hono-chan...?\r\nAkira: You can tell by looking, so I'll say she's off on her own here.\r\nEllen: Is she protecting your flag? Or, is she sneaking over to ours. --One of those two, right?\r\nKiyoka: Since it's Hono-chan... She wouldn't sit still and watch the flag. So it might be down to the captain.\r\nEllen: I was thinking the same thing. Let's take out Inagon and Yomiyomi and get their flag, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Alright!\r\nAkira: I'm all for a fight! Let's do this, Yomi!\r\nYomi: Right.\r\n\r\nMihono: Aww... So Fukki's ship won in the end?\r\nKofuki: Well, on accident.\r\nMihono: But still-, that means there was no point in how hard we worked getting Yui's map, so it's twice as frustrating!\r\nAkira: Yeah, guess not.\r\nAkira: But y'know, it was pretty damn fun swinging around toy swords instead of our okatana for once, right?\r\nMihono: Yeah-- it was like I was back to playing around as a kid again!\r\nEllen: I get the feeling Kaoru would have fun playing this. Maybe I should invite her, when we get a day off.\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san would as well.

A-Ask m-me?\r\nAkira: Huh... Why'd she suddenly get all weird?\r\nYomi: Isn't that... because she's scared of the way you look like a bad person, Akira?\r\nAkira: It's not like I did anything to her... And anyway, that's pretty blunt of you. Kinda hurt.\r\nSuu: I-I'm sorry... Then, if you'll let me, I'll go over in detail how we found the treasure, to... to the best of my ability!!\r\nAkira: You don't gotta apologize.\r\nSuu: I'm sorry... Ah, ah, I'm sorry...!

And help them out too!\r\n\r\nMihono: Good thing everybody was happy with it!\r\nMihono: Fukki and Inami-san got mad at me for picking the teams for them though.\r\nEllen: But, I do think it's simplest doing the treasure hunt with the same teams we fought aradama with today.\r\nHiyori: And it'd be annoying going out of our way to decide on new teams.\r\nEllen: We might be on different teams, but I'm glad I get to play with you, Hiyoyon. It's been a while since we got to do something like this.\r\nHiyori: Well... I am on the same team as Inami Suu and Kofuki. Can't say I'm not worried.\r\nEllen: I predict Hiyoyon and her merry friends will be a tough team to beat!\r\nMihono: Ellen-san's team with Yui and Kiyoka seems tough too, but we aren't gonna lose-!\r\nAkira: You tell 'em, Mihono. Let's go find that treasure for ourselves!\r\nMihono: Hmmm. What do you think the treasure pendants'll be like?\r\nYui: That's one thing to look forward to, but what I really want to see to is everybody dressed like pirates! I'll burn it deep into my eyes and plenty of photos on my phone~!\r\nMihono: Yeah, yeah! Besides the treasure hunt, it's going to be so fun fighting in pirate cosplay for the flags-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pirate - Mihono: End]: The Treasure Comes After we Take Down Their Pirate Flag!\r\n\r\nMihono: Wawah!?\r\nMihono: It's great and all I made it over to this ship without Kiyoka and them noticing, but... Bringing down their pirate flag is actually tough...!\r\nYui: Fu fu fu~. And what about you, Mihono-chan? You sure you didn't want to stop us from bringing down your pirate flag?\r\nMihono: Eh... Our ship-- Are Kiyoka and Ellen-san there already!?\r\nMihono: Wait... Nobody's there. Yuiii~.\r\nYui: If you take down our flag, we have to give you the treasure map-. So I'll tell a lie if I have to.\r\nMihono: But, that's not enough to make me give up!\r\n\r\nAkira: Me and Yomi'll take 'em head on, dealing with anybody coming off of Yui's ship.\r\nAkira: I want you protecting our flag, Mihono. If they take it down, they get to take our treasure map.\r\nMihono: Then...\r\nAkira: That's what I wanna say, but we're pirates. It'd be lame to just stand guard.\r\nAkira: So, a little after we start up, you sneak on board their ship and take their flag down. Then it's all ours.\r\nMihono: But, what happens if they get on board our ship?\r\nYomi: We can worry about that when it happens, is that right?\r\nAkira: Well, that's how we're winging it. Sounds cooler for you too, right, Mihono?\r\nMihono: Yeah! I'll sneak in and take down their flag! Leave it to me!\r\n\r\nMihono: I thought I'd get in all sneaky and bring your flag down though...\r\nYui: If that was... your sneaking, being a spy or a ninja really isn't for you, Mihono-chan.\r\nYui: I kept hearing \"Ahh!\" and \"Crap!\" \r\nMihono: No way~... I thought I was doing perfect though.\r\nMihono: But still, so long as I keep pulling the rope hard--\r\nAkira: That's it! Keep it up just like that, Mihono!\r\nMihono: EIIII---!!\r\n\r\nMihono: Even though we got Yui's pirate flag, we didn't have any time to look for treasure...!\r\nAkira: Suu's team found the pirate pendants first anyway, so we lost either way.\r\nEllen: With the number of people we had today, we couldn't keep up with two teams at once.\r\nEllen: If we had more people, I bet it would be twice as much fun-!\r\nMihono: Next time I want to invite Kanami and Chii-nee along.\r\nSuu: ......\r\nMihono: Though, even though she found the treasure, Inami-san doesn't look happy about it at all.\r\nKiyoka: From what I heard, it sounds like there was an aradama hiding by the treasure... Apparently it was a really small one though.\r\nKiyoka: And then Kofuki-san chased after it, leaving Inami-san alone in a dark model cave for a while.\r\nMihono: Ahh... Fukki... She would run off and leave her, wouldn't she. If she saw an aradama.\r\nMihono: Maybe I'll ask her if she wants to get something tasty to eat after.\r\nKiyoka: Mm, we should do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/61uP0-QaIpA\r\n[Pirate - Hiyori: Start]: Inami and Shichinosato and...\r\n\r\nAradama: KSHAAAAAA...!!\r\nSuu: ...I-It's here!?\r\nHiyori: (There's no way she'll beat it hunched over in fear like that--)\r\nSuu: Uwah!?

Thank you so much, Juujou-san!\r\n\r\nSuu: You really did help me out back there...! I wasn't sure what would happen for a minute...\r\nHiyori: I get that you're scared, but... If you keep acting like that on missions, you're going to get hurt someday. You and your--\r\nEllen: Hiyoyon, Inamin! Good news, I have a surprise for you-.\r\nHiyori: Nn? What do you mean, Ellen?\r\nEllen: Get this. The amusement park people asked if we wanted to try playing with their new attraction.\r\nEllen: It's a special service, since us toji are always working so hard.\r\nSuu: You don't mean... \"Treasures of the Pirates\"...!\r\nEllen: You sure do know your stuff, Inamin.\r\nEllen: Everyone else can't wait to try it, so, will you two be joining in?\r\nHiyori: Sure. Can't exactly... be the only one going back early.\r\nEllen: Fufu, thanks for that~.\r\nHiyori: What's this attraction like?\r\nEllen: From the sound of it, we're all pirates searching for treasure. You can steal maps from other pirates too... the other people competing to get the treasure, so there's different ways to play.\r\nHiyori: You can steal maps from the other players?\r\nSuu: It's sort of a team battle treasure hunt, but all the maps each team gets are different, and some of them are supposed to be fakes.\r\nHiyori: I see. It sounds a bit tough. How about let Kofuki know and head over for now.\r\nSuu: U-Um... I'll let you two tell Shichinosato-san about this by yourselves.\r\nEllen: Sure thing. Don't worry. I'll break it to Fukki so she'll join us for sure-!\r\nSuu: I-I leave it to you...!\r\n\r\nSuu: ...So then, we'll be aiming to clear \"Treasures of the Pirates\" with the teams we were in fighting aradama before...\r\nSuu: But, what should we do? Juujou-san, Shichinosato-san...\r\nKofuki: I don't really have a choice, so I'll do this with you; at least till we get to the X on the map.\r\nHiyori: Are we fine with not going after the other team's maps?\r\nKofuki: Mihocchi was all, \"Let's plunder-!\" but if the map you steal's no good, there's no point.\r\nSuu: ...I think that's fine! It's important to clear the game fast too!\r\nHiyori: There is a time limit; they were saying it goes until the cannons fire 3 times.\r\nSuu: It should be just about thirty minutes.\r\nHiyori: We might be hard on time if we get in fights.\r\nHiyori: There's a drawing like a cave on our treasure map, so we should go there first...\r\nHiyori: You can hold onto the map.\r\nKofuki: You know I'm just here to make the team's even, right?\r\nHiyori: Suu's... not the most reliable.\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nKofuki: Tch... Guess if I've gotta.\r\nSuu: Ehh... As long as there aren't any aradama, I'm not like that! ...I won't lose the map, okay!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pirate - Hiyori: End]: This Might Not Be So Bad Every Now and Then... Huh\r\n\r\nSuu: I didn't think the cave drawing on the map would take us to a big stalactite cave facility, and they even had a boat for us. This has to be it--\r\nSuu: --HYAUU!?\r\nKofuki: Don't shout like that outta nowhere... You made me jump.\r\nSuu: But some water dripped on me! They made this way too real in some weird places...\r\nHiyori: Anyway, you were just saying you thought this was it; why's that?\r\nSuu: They put a lot of effort into making this place, so I don't think they'd go this far if the right treasure wasn't here.\r\nKofuki: Putting it pretty straight out there. Though, this does feel like the kinda place that'd have a pirate treasure.\r\nHiyori: So that's another way of looking for it. Then, there's a good chance the treasure's up ahead.\r\nSuu: The old pirates' treasured pendants should be here. Finding that is the best way to get points in this game.\r\n\r\nHiyori: Oi... Look! Over there.\r\nSuu: Wow... That's a super realistic looking skeleton!\r\nKofuki: This must be it. Hey you, go and get the thing.\r\nSuu: Roger that-. Inami Suu is setting off-.\r\n\r\nAradama: GYUUU...!\r\nSuu: GYAAH!? Something came out!?\r\nSuu: ...A-A-A-Aradamaaa!?\r\nKofuki: ...What!? After it!\r\n\r\nAradama: ......\r\nKofuki: You're running around all over the place, but this is it!\r\nHiyori: It was so small it hardly showed up on the spectrum finder, so it's a good thing we found it.\r\nKofuki: There might be others around; let's look.\r\nHiyori: Should we message Ellen and Kiyoka and them?\r\nKofuki: Shouldn't have to. The two of us are enough. Well, I could do it myself though.\r\nHiyori: Maybe you could, but you shouldn't go alone.\r\nHiyori: ...What about Suu?\r\nKofuki: There was just one of them, so she'll be fine back there. Let's get this done as fast as we can.\r\n\r\nSuu: Even if... I don't want to fight aradama... I thought it was really mean the way you left me behind!\r\nKofuki: We still came back fast enough.\r\nSuu: I think that place might have been starting to give me a fear of the dark too...\r\nHiyori: Though from the looks of it, it didn't.\r\nHiyori: And anyway, thanks to you, we got the pendant.\r\nSuu: Juujou-san, are you... trying really poorly to make me feel better?\r\nHiyori: ...Urgh. I do feel a little bad.\r\nKofuki: Next time something happens, I'll beat some aradama-chan for you to make up for it.\r\nHiyori: And you... You just want to hunt aradama yourself, am I wrong?\r\nSuu: That's right, tell her some more!\r\nKofuki: Oh! Mihocchi and Kiyoka are headed over. Go shove this pendant in their faces, Hunchback.\r\nSuu: Hunchback!? Could you please not call me weird names... It's rude!\r\nHiyori: Good grief...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/ee9V9yy0uqk\r\n[Pirate - Suu: Start]: After Eliminating the Aradama--\r\n\r\nAradama: AAAAA...\r\nSuu: GYAH!

Either wait it out or do something yourself!\r\nSuu: Come onnn~.

Thank you so much, Juujou-san!\r\n\r\nKofuki: So, we took care of the aradama, but why're we still in the amusement park?\r\nMihono: C'mon, Fukki. You heard Ellen-san, didn't you?\r\nMihono: We're here cause somebody from the park said we could play on their new attraction to test it out!\r\nSuu: We're super lucky they're letting us play on it. \"Treasures of the Pirates\" is really popular, so it has a reputation for being hard to get onto!\r\nAkira: Dressing up like pirates and going treasure hunting sounds pretty cool.\r\nEllen: It sets a nice mood, doesn't it-. I want to hurry up and play it!\r\nMihono: So anyway, you do it with us, Fukki.\r\nMihono: Well actually, I already signed us up as the same teams we had when we were stopping the aradama just now.\r\nKofuki/Suu: ...Don't go deciding that on your own!/Why did you decide on that for us!?\r\nMihono: Eh-!?\r\n\r\nSuu: ......\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nHiyori: This \"treasure map\" the park attendant gave us... Seems like some of them are fakes.\r\nSuu: They are. Which is why, sometimes this turns into a game of fighting over \"treasure maps\" between the other teams\r\nHiyori: So that's why Ellen and Kiyoka said they'd start searching after they collect all the maps.\r\nKofuki: What a waste of time... Let's just go to the point marked on the map we've got, and if that's not it, we're done-.\r\nSuu: ......\r\nSuu: (She really... doesn't seem interested in anything besides aradama. Does Shichinosato-san not have any hobbies or anything?)\r\nKofuki: ...Nn?\r\nKofuki: What, you got a problem with that?\r\nSuu: No-! I think that could work too...!\r\nSuu: Then, let's go as quickly as possible to the place on the map!\r\nKofuki: Oi... Wait a sec. She didn't even look at the map; where's she think she's going?\r\nHiyori: ...Guess we should go after her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pirate - Suu: End]: This Was Supposed to Be All Fun and Games...!\r\n\r\nHiyori: So if we find... a pendant from an ancient pirate treasure before time runs out, we win?\r\nSuu: Yes. It looks like you also get points for stealing other team's maps, but getting a pendant is worth the most.\r\nKofuki: Aghh... Instead of treasure, could we get some aradama-chan in here~.\r\nSuu: No, no, no, no, finding the treasure would be a million times better...! And besides, didn't you beat plenty of aradama today-?\r\nKofuki: There were too many of you here, so I got even less to play with-. I'm not even close to satisfied...\r\nSuu: Ehh...\r\nHiyori: Oi... Look! Over there.\r\nSuu: Wow... That's a super realistic looking skeleton!\r\nKofuki: This must be it. Hey you, go and get the thing.\r\nSuu: Understood-. Inami Suu is setting off-.\r\n\r\nAradama: GYUUU...!\r\nSuu: GYAAH!? Something came out!?\r\nSuu: ...A-A-A-Aradamaaa!?\r\nKofuki: ...What!? After it!\r\nHiyori: I know...!\r\nKofuki: Fufufu...! You're tiny, but you're not getting away!\r\nSuu: ...Ahh! Wait, please wait...! Don't leave me alone in this place-!?\r\n\r\nMihono: That's crazy-! So Fukki, you found the treasure and even beat an aradama?\r\nKofuki: Sure, but it was so freaking small it was over in seconds.\r\nSuu: You could have come right back then... Why did you leave me there for over ten minutes...\r\nHiyori: We needed to check around to see if there were any other aradama, just to be sure.\r\nHiyori: And you had your okatana with you, didn't you?\r\nSuu: I did... In theory, I get what you're saying. In theory...\r\nKiyoka: Since it was Kofuki-san who said to leave Inami-san behind... she probably wanted to keep the aradama all to herself. She didn't even contact us or anything.\r\nHiyori: You really get her, Kiyoka.\r\nKofuki: I wanted to beat some aradama-chan, what's wrong with that? Besides, if this scaredycat was in the boat, it'd be more dangerous with her in the way.\r\nSuu: Ah, that makes sense...?\r\nKofuki: Next time we're on a mission together, I'll take care of all your ones for you. Then you won't be whining about it, right?\r\nSuu: In that case... sure.\r\nKiyoka: You can't give in to her, Inami-san.\r\nSuu: Ah...!\r\nSuu: (I don't even want to be on missions with her in the first place... Am I getting dragged into Shichinosato-san's pace little by little!?)\r\nSuu: (I have to hold tight onto myself...!)\r\nSuu: (Though I'm not even sure if I can...)"}, {"paste_key": "Dc2d7XXL", "title": "5-5.3 Time Won't Stop", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/Dc2d7XXL", "timestamp": "", "hits": "84", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://streamable.com/dxgm29\r\n7: Spreading Ripples\r\n\r\nAkane: Now then, Maki-san, Yomi-san, Yume-san.

It didn't seem like they've perfected it, but it definitely raises a toji's overall capabilities.\r\nMaki: It's just...\r\nYukari: What is it?\r\nYume: It was like she'd turned into some kind of monster.\r\nYukari: ......\r\nChie: Excuse us.\r\nKaoru: ...\r\nMaki: Setouchi Chie and Mashiko Kaoru?\r\nAkane: I called them here, thinking we would need information on Mokusa's side as well.\r\nMaki: Do they know the situation?\r\nYukari: We'll tell them what they need to know.\r\nKaoru: Tamayori toji... Is it true they're doing experiments fusing aradama and toji?\r\nKaoru: I'd heard the Hitakami faction was doing research on strengthening toji, but this tamayori thing...\r\nKaoru: Are Akira and them seriously doing that?\r\nMaki: It's the truth.\r\nMaki: We personally fought with a toji we think was subjected to those experiments.\r\nYomi: ...\r\nChie: And they tried forcing Mihono-chan... Asakura Mihono to help with their research.\r\nKaoru: ...Why Mihono? Because of that power she got from Kashuu Kiyomitsu?\r\nMaki: That power of Asakura Mihono's...?\r\nChie: That's...\r\nAkane: I'll tell them.\r\nAkane: Asakura-san's power stems from the great aradama, Kanayamahime. As it goes, the great aradama Kanayamahime has been passed down for generations through the eldest daughters of the Asakura family.\r\nMaki: A great aradama!?\r\nYume: You mean, like Tagitsuhime?\r\nYukari: That's correct.\r\nChie: ...\r\nMaki: I propose having Asakura Mihono give up her okatana.\r\nMaki: We can't allow the Hitakami faction to have her either, so she'll need guards... We can do that.\r\nChie: Wait! You're saying you'll make Mihono-chan quit being a toji!?\r\nMaki: That's right. It's only a temporary measure, but, if this is as dangerous as with Tagitsuhime, it's something we'd better do.\r\nChie: That's going too far!\r\nChie: We already took into account the risk of her losing control and had her pulled off of any missions!\r\nMaki: That's just turning a blind eye to the heart of the problem. So long as there's a risk of the great aradama awakening, there's steps we need to take.\r\nAkane: Please calm down, both of you. As for what should be done with Asakura-san... I will give you my answer on behalf of the Sword Administration Bureau.\r\nAkane: Asakura Mihono will continue to be left with the investigation team. However, the next time she shows signs of rampancy, we will immediately place her under confinement.\r\nChie: Confinement...\r\nAkane: This is a government issued directive and will not be altered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/1auqeg\r\n8: The Reason Behind her Decision (1)\r\n\r\nAkira: I'm against this.

Please understand that.\r\nAkira: We've already heard all that.\r\nAkira: Anybody closest to the Atago family has the highest compatibility for tamayori. That's why somebody from the Hitakamis like you has the best shot, right?\r\nAkira: But, since Yuuki and me are related to the Hitakamis, that means we should be plenty compatible.\r\nAkira: Am I wrong?\r\nMakoto: ...\r\nAkira: This isn't something you can laugh off!\r\nYuuki: ...We're serious about this.\r\nYuuki: Why can't you just tell us to be tamayori test subjects! Please, Makoto-nee-sama!\r\nYuuki: All you have to do is say that, and we would gladly do it for you!\r\nMakoto: ...\r\nMakoto: (That's the very reason I can't tell you that, Yuuki-chan.)\r\nMakoto: ...You know, don't you?\r\nMakoto: If someone incompatible is forced through the experiment, rather than equipping onto the body, the aradama becomes fused to the flesh...\r\nAkira: Do you not get it yourself?\r\nAkira: If that's what'll happen to us, then an experiment with you is bound to fail too.\r\nAkira: And, if there's a chance it'll work for you, then there's just as much a chance it'll work for us!\r\nAkira: So let us do it!\r\nMakoto: ......Among the three of us, I am still the most compatible.

This is a pretty lousy map.\r\nHiyori: It at least says, \"Under the pirates' cherry tree\"...\r\nKanami: The pirates' cherry tree?\r\nMihono: Ooh, that sounds kinda cool!\r\nKiyoka: I wish we'd come during cherry blossom season. I bet it would have looked beautiful.\r\nHiyori: According to the map... It's that way? Let's go.\r\nAll 3: Okaaay~.\r\n\r\nHiyori: The map says it should be here...\r\nKiyoka: In this park... Let me look it up for a minute.\r\nMihono: You think there's a pirates' cherry tree here?\r\nKanami: Hmmm, I don't see any trees that look like they're the one, do you? Maybe we should ask somebody.\r\nKiyoka: Wait, Etou-san.\r\nKiyoka: I did find an article about the pirates' cherry tree, but... it looks like it was chopped down five years ago.\r\nKiyoka: It says it was the end of its lifespan...\r\nKanami: Oh, huh. That's sort of disappointing...\r\nHiyori: ...At the very least, this map had to have been written over five years ago.\r\nMihono: What if it really is a treasure map!\r\nKanami: This is getting exciting!\r\nHiyori: So then, Kiyoka. What happened with the cherry tree?\r\nKiyoka: It looks like the tree stump should still be in the middle of the park.\r\nHiyori: Then, we should still have the right place.\r\nMihono: Let's go, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Ah! Wait for me, Hono-chan!\r\nKanami: We should go too, Hiyori-chan.\r\nHiyori: I'll go ask permission, just in case.

Let's dig up under the pirates' cherry tree stump!\r\nMihono: Hmm, nothing over here. What about you guys?\r\nKiyoka: I didn't find anything either. Just how deep do you think it's buried?\r\nKanami: Maybe it's buried reaaally deep or something.\r\nHiyori: ...No, it shouldn't be that hard to get. It's probably...\r\nHiyori: Ah.\r\nMihono: What's up, Juujou-san?\r\nHiyori: My spade hit something.\r\nKiyoka: Really!?\r\nKanami: Let me see, Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: Don't all of you come over here at once!\r\nHiyori: There's a box and a map, it looks like. The box... is locked and won't open.\r\nMihono: The next map, and a box we can't open! It's turning more into a treasure hunt!\r\nHiyori: You're not wrong. Though, I don't think this chest has the gold you're hoping for.\r\nMihono: Eh?\r\nHiyori: ...Wait, let me put that better. This was definitely something buried here for toji to find, don't you think?\r\nHiyori: But, I don't think this is something that impressive. When the park manager handed me the spades, I was sure of it.\r\nKiyoka: ...Ah, the manager must've known this box was buried just deep enough that we could dig it out with these.\r\nHiyori: It's a natural conclusion.\r\nHiyori: ...So, do you want to keep going?\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nKanami: ...I'll keep going.\r\nKanami: I mean, when they gave us the map, it was because we're toji, right? When you got the spades, did they try to stop you, Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: ...No, they told me to try our best.\r\nKanami: Then, we should keep going! We'll find the treasure together!\r\nMihono: I'm with Kanami!\r\nMihono: I don't know why whoever hid the treasure did it, but they made treasure maps and came up with all this, right?\r\nMihono: So I'm sure they must've wanted whoever came here looking for treasure to have fun finding it!\r\nKiyoka: Do you think so?\r\nMihono: I know it!\r\nMihono: But still, who could've buried the treasure here anyway?\r\nHiyori: There's a good chance this was just someone's idea of killing time back then.\r\nHiyori: Anyway, let's keep going with the treasure hunt. The next destination is... \"Follow the legend of the pirates\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Pirates' Treasure\r\n\r\nIslander A: The legend of the pirates? Let me see that map for a second... Alright. That's probably what they mean.\r\nIslander B: Ahh, I get it. The shrine, right? That old story about the girl who fought to protect the island from pirates.\r\nIslander C: You want to know what happened to the girl? She won in fighting off the pirates, but she passed on from her wounds then.\r\nIslander C: Nowadays, she's enshrined at a shrine here on the island. If you're looking to go there, see, you can take that bus.\r\nKiyoka: ...\r\n\r\nMihono: We made it to the shrine, but... Where do you think the next map is?\r\nKiyoka: ...\r\nHiyori: What's wrong, Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: Nothing... It's just, I've been thinking about the pirate legend this whole time.\r\nKiyoka: About the girl who protected the island from the pirates. And, why was it a girl?\r\nKanami: What do you mean?\r\nKiyoka: They were pirates, weren't they?\r\nKiyoka: It would be a more standard story if the girl were kidnapped, but the girl is the one who fought them. Don't you think that's a little odd?\r\nKanami: Is it?\r\nMihono: Well, we fight too.\r\nKiyoka: Exactly! That's what I mean, Hono-chan!\r\nMihono: Uwah!? Wh-What do you mean!?\r\nKiyoka: Basically, the pirates in the legend; what if they were aradama?\r\nHiyori: Hmm. That's an interesting way of thinking about it. I think it's possible enough.\r\nHiyori: You're right that, when you rethink it as a toji fighting to protect the island from aradama, it lines up.\r\nMihono: But then... That means there was a toji here who was lost fighting aradama, right...?\r\nKanami: Would that mean, the pirates' treasure is the okatana that toji was using?\r\nKiyoka: I think that could be it.\r\nMihono: Then, we should find that okatana! We'll bring it back with us!\r\nHiyori: Calm down a minute.\r\nHiyori: We're only talking about how the old pirate legend could have been like that.\r\nHiyori: But we're saying the treasure we're looking for right now isn't connected to the legend.\r\nMihono: Ah, it's not...?\r\nHiyori: At any rate, this should definitely be the place the last map marked.\r\nHiyori: Let's look around to see if there's another map here.\r\nKiyoka: We should ask the shrine's priest if they know something. Maybe they'll be familiar with it, like at the park.\r\n\r\nPriest: Yes, I know about it. Back then, a toji who came to our island to suppress aradama left me with a key.\r\nPriest: I'll bring it to you, so please give me a moment.\r\nHiyori: ...So was this toji who came here on a mission the one who made the maps...?\r\nKanami: I wasn't expecting to hear that.\r\nHiyori: ...Well, it could happen.\r\nPriest: Here it is, this here.\r\nMihono: Um, I just want to make sure of something... That toji, did she get hurt or anything on her mission...?\r\nPriest: Not at all; she was finished with the aradama before we knew it, then went back home.\r\nMihono: That's good then!\r\nKanami: Thank you very much for getting the key for us! The toji who left it with you, what was she like?\r\nPriest: What was she like... It was twenty years ago, so... Hmm.\r\nKanami: You can't remember after all?\r\nPriest: Maybe so... Well, come to think of it...\r\nPriest: There were two of them, and they might have reminded me of you two.\r\nKanami: Me and...\r\nHiyori: Me?\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan, you think that means...?\r\nHiyori: Probably.\r\nMihono: Eh? Eh? It's no fair that you're the only ones who get it!\r\nMihono: Right, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: I think you're just terrible at picking up on things, Hono-chan...\r\nMihono: Wait, so I'm the only one who doesn't get it!?\r\nHiyori: I'm opening the box.\r\nHiyori: This is... Well, it isn't a map. There's something written on it.\r\nHiyori: ...\"A match at the Pirates' Cove at sundown\".\r\n\r\nMihono: So in the end, we came back here. And... what are we supposed to do now?\r\nKanami: It said \"a match\", so isn't it telling us to fight off here on the beach?\r\nHiyori: Then let's give it a shot. Get ready, Kanami.\r\nKanami: Sure thing, Hiyori-chan!\r\nKiyoka: Um, I think that might be wrong...\r\nKanami/Hiyori: Huh?\r\nKiyoka: See, doesn't this come up a lot? There's a point where the shadows reach as the sun sets, that kind of thing.\r\nKiyoka: Those boulders there, their shadows look suspicious.\r\nMihono: Nice going, Kiyoka! That's what you get, reading those books all the time! Umm, the sun's that way, so the shadows go... Here!\r\nHiyori: I get it, their shadows do look like they're dueling.\r\nKanami: Let's go check it out!\r\n\r\nKanami: This is the spot. I'll dig it up.\r\nKanami: ...There it is.\r\nHiyori: ...\r\nMihono: This one really looks like a treasure box. Hey, can I open it?\r\nKiyoka: Don't do that, Hono-chan. Etou-san and Juujou-san have to be the ones to open this.\r\nMihono: Huh?\r\nKanami: I'm opening it.\r\nKanami: ...There's two letters inside.\r\nKanami: \"To me ten years from now... Minato.\"\r\nHiyori: Let me see the other one.\r\nHiyori: This says, \"To myself ten years from now, Kagari.\" It's my mom's.\r\nKanami: It's a time capsule left by our mothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: To Us in Ten Years\r\n\r\nKagari: A time capsule?\r\nMinato: Yeah, a time capsule!\r\nMinato: See, this island has that legend about the pirates, right? So then, wouldn't it be fun to bury a time capsule? Like it's a treasure hunt.\r\nKagari: Huh?\r\nKagari: If it's a treasure hunt, wouldn't we also be the ones finding it after its hidden? That's only making a mystery we already know the solution to.\r\nMinato: It'll be fine. A decade from now, I bet we'll have forgotten.\r\nKagari: A decade...\r\nMinato: Yep, a whole decade.\r\nMinato: Ten years from now, let's come back and dig this up together, Kagari.\r\nKagari: ......\r\nMinato: Don't want to?\r\nMinato: I think it'll definitely be fun though... We could talk about how things used to be like and stuff while we look for it again.\r\nKagari: Leaving aside whether or not it's fun, what you're saying is I'll still be together with you ten years from now, Minato-senpai.\r\nMinato: You sure will.\r\nKagari: ...Sigh.\r\nKagari: (But, ten years from now...)\r\nKagari: (No. If I can dig it up in ten years... That wouldn't be so bad.)\r\nKagari: (If that much time can have passed...)\r\nKagari: Fine then. I'm not sure if I'll still be cleaning up after you in ten years, but I'll join you for this.\r\nMinato: Awesomeee!\r\nKagari: Please don't get excited about this like a little kid.\r\nKagari: So, what are we putting inside the time capsule?\r\nMinato: Let's see... We can't not put in letters; that's a must-have for time capsules.\r\nMinato: After that, we can just throw in photos or shells or something, right?\r\nKagari: Just throw them in...\r\nMinato: Leaving letters is plenty already.\r\nMinato: For what we write on them, \"To me ten years from now\" is sure to do it.\r\nKagari: Fine. Then, I'll write, \"Thank you for putting up with being forced around by Minato-senpai even after ten years.\"\r\nMinato: Ehh, am I really forcing you around?\r\nKagari: You force me around more than enough.\r\nKagari: (...Now then.)\r\nKagari: (There's no point in writing a letter to myself ten years from now. The next time you come to this island... I'm sure I won't be here.)\r\nKagari: (So... I'll write my letter to Minato-senpai instead.)\r\nKagari: (Minato-senpai, even after I'm gone from the world, I hope you can still stay the same as you've always been...)\r\nMinato: Kagari, if you're done writing, let me see!\r\nKagari: You can't see it.\r\nKagari: (...I can't even picture what she would look like depressed.)\r\nKagari: (Ten years from now, she'll surely have that same smile on her face.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Our Own Time Capsule\r\n\r\nKanami: It's a time capsule left by our mothers.\r\nMihono: Ehhh!?\r\nMihono: Why would a time capsule from your mothers be buried here!?\r\nHiyori: Like they said at the shrine, the toji who came here suppressing aradama twenty years ago must have been Minato-san and my mom.\r\nHiyori: Though, a time capsule... I didn't think my mom would do something like that.\r\nKanami: I'm just guessing, but maybe my mother's the one who suggested it? I can see her saying, \"It'll be fun!\"\r\nHiyori: So Minato-san pushed my mom into doing it.\r\nKanami: That sort of reminds me of you, Hiyori-chan.\r\nHiyori: How so?\r\nKanami: Because in the end, you still came along on this treasure hunt with us.\r\nHiyori: Urgh...\r\nMihono: Hey, besides the letters, it looks like there's other stuff in here.\r\nKiyoka: Seashells and a photo?\r\nKiyoka: Ah, this photo...\r\nKanami: It's a photo of my mother and Kagari-san!\r\nHiyori: ...\r\nHiyori: ...Mom looks like she's in a bad mood.\r\nMihono: Does she? To me, it looks like she's enjoying it...\r\nHiyori: You think so?\r\nMihono: Yeah! After all, you make that same face sometimes, Juujou-san!\r\nHiyori: ...\r\nKiyoka: So... what should we do with these?\r\nMihono: Should we open up the letters?\r\nKanami/Hiyori: ......\r\nKanami/Hiyori: Nah./No.\r\nKanami: I get the feeling this isn't something I should read. The next time I visit her grave, I'll bring this with me.\r\nHiyori: I'll do the same.\r\nHiyori: For a souvenir... This photo is more than enough.\r\nMihono: Alright... Yeah! That's just fine!\r\nKiyoka: It feels kind of like fate, for their daughters to find the time capsule their mothers buried...\r\nKanami: It does...\r\nKanami: Our mothers saw this exact same view...\r\nHiyori: ...We won't find a better treasure than this.\r\nKiyoka: Juujou-san, that sounded a little corny...\r\nHiyori: What!?\r\nKanami: Ahahaha!\r\nMihono: I know! I came up with a good idea! We should bury a time capsule of our own too!\r\nMihono: And then, we can get somebody to dig it up twenty years from now!\r\nKanami: Yeah, that sounds neat!\r\nKiyoka: It doesn't feel like a time capsule anymore, if you're having someone else dig it up...\r\nHiyori: Then we'll just have to be the ones to come dig it up ourselves.\r\nHiyori: Let's think about what we want to bury.\r\nMihono/Kiyoka: Okaaay!\r\nKanami: ...\r\nHiyori: What's wrong, Kanami?\r\nKanami: Nothing...\r\nKanami: Just thinking, I'm really glad I got put on this mission."}, {"paste_key": "RCfSe0QX", "title": "casual ellen/dress yukari/fantasy hiyori", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/RCfSe0QX", "timestamp": "", "hits": "42", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://streamable.com/hi1gq6\r\n[Casual '20 - Ellen: Start]: The Pair's New Year's Eve\r\n\r\nAradama: GUOOOOO...\r\nKaoru: They're still coming?

Let's give it one last push!\r\nEllen: I'm going in! HAAAAAAAAAAAH!\r\nAradama: Keeeee...\r\nKaoru: Alright, guess that's it for this year's slave labor. Another long year jammed with work after work...\r\nEllen: Good job pulling through another year! Or, that's what I'd like to say, but... the spectrum finder is still picking something up.\r\nKaoru: Sigh... Everybody else's already on their New Year's break, but we don't even get this or Obon off...\r\nNene: Nee...\r\nEllen: Kaoru, Nene, there's not much left to do, so let's try our best! After this mission's over, there's my Papa and Mama's countdown party waiting for us!\r\nKaoru: Yeah, that's right. The luxury party they rented out a huge room at a high class hotel for.\r\nEllen: With delicious food, and all the amazing sweets you could want! So let's finish this mission quick, so we can make it in time for the party.\r\nKaoru: Well, it's true that, after all the work we've done, you'd want spend at least the very end of the year getting treated for it.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\n\r\nKaoru: Sigh... I can't do any more after this. There can't be any more of them, right?\r\nEllen: You did great! It seems we cleared out the aradama, so that means this year's missions are finally complete!\r\nEllen: If we race back to the party now, we should make it in time for the countdown! Let's hurry!\r\n\r\nKaoru: Nobody's here...\r\nNene: Nee...\r\nEllen: Apparently the party ended while we were stuck in traffic. Sorry to disappoint you, Kaoru.\r\nKaoru: Nah, it's fine. This is just how things go for us cogs in the system... It's actually the perfect New Year's for drones like us. Come on, might as well go home and go to bed.\r\nEllen: Hold on a moment! Over there, there's one table with food still laid out!\r\nKaoru: Ohh, you're right! Don't tell me they left it for us?\r\nEllen: That's what it looks like. There's a message card from Papa and Mama, and a New Year's Present too.\r\nKaoru: Present? This envelope done up in a ribbon? What's inside?\r\nEllen: It's a keycard.\r\nKaoru: A keycard? And where does that get us into?\r\nEllen: Fufu. That's something you can look forward to finding out later!\r\nEllen: Anyway, Kaoru, we might not have made it in time for the countdown, but let's celebrate New Year's.\r\nEllen: Let's start with a toast! Kaoru, Nene, thanks so much for everything this past year. I'm looking forward to spending the next year with you too.\r\nEllen: Cheers!\r\n\r\nKaoru: Fwah, I'm stuffed. My stomach's too full to move anymore.\r\nNene: Nee...\r\nEllen: I'm glad it put you back in a better mood!\r\nEllen: I just got a message from Kanamin. Wow! So she and Hiyoyon went and did their first shrine visit. Take a look, Kaoru; they look like they're having fun in this picture.\r\nKaoru: Hahah... Those are some nice smiles. Look at them, enjoying their New Year's break.\r\nEllen: There's more too. \"We're going to the mountaintop now to see the first sunrise. Do you and Kaoru-chan want to join us?\"\r\nKaoru: The first sunrise... Sorry, but I'm dead after that mission, and, after eating that much, I don't have it in me to go out again.\r\nKaoru: Besides, I'm not even sure I can stay up till sunrise. And there's just no way I'm climbing up a mountain and sitting in the cold until it comes up.\r\nKaoru: Seriously, the timing this year's been the worst right out the gate.\r\nNene: Nee.\r\nEllen: Come on and cheer up, Kaoru, Nene.

Hiyori-chan, don't you want to go see!\r\nHiyori: Why not. Since she asked us to call off our plans to see the sunrise, whatever it is must be something amazing.\r\n\r\nEllen: We're here!\r\nKaoru: And where's \"here\"...?\r\nEllen: The members-only lounge on the hotel's top floor! The sunrise you can see from up here is very beautiful.\r\nHiyori: So that's why. It's hard to tell since it's still night out, but I'm sure a floor this high gets a good view of it.\r\nKanami: Thanks, Ellen-chan! Now if it could only be sunrise already-.\r\nEllen: It's still going to take a while, so let's have some tea while we wait! Here, Kaoru, some warm milk tea for you.\r\nKaoru: Fwahh~, that's good stuff. Sitting out in the cold until the sun came up wasn't gonna happen, but I feel like I could wait for hours like this.\r\nKaoru: The heater's working, the sofa's sucking me in... Yawnn... Getting sleepy...\r\nKaoru: [snooze...]\r\nNene: Nenee...\r\nKanami: Kaoru-chan fell asleep just sitting down, huh.\r\nHiyori: She must be tired, since she was working missions all the way to New Year's Eve.\r\nEllen: How about we let her sleep like this until the sunrise.\r\n\r\nKaoru: [sleepy breathing...]\r\nEllen: Kaoru, wake up now. The sun's just about to come up.\r\nKaoru: ...Nn? Feels like Ellen's voice is right in my ear...\r\nKaoru: Ah-- I must've passed out on your lap at some point.\r\nEllen: Yes, you were sleeping like a baby.\r\nEllen: Kaoru, the sun's going to be coming up out the windows over there. Let's go see.\r\nKaoru: Yeah, I'd love to go see it, but... Between this cushy sofa and your lap, I'm feeling so cozy my body's refusing to get up.\r\nNene: Nee...\r\nKaoru: Even while we're talking, I feel like I'm about to drift off again... Sorry Ellen, for being like this first thing in the year.\r\nEllen: It's alright, Kaoru. Even like this, you can still see out the window.\r\nEllen: Ah, looks like the sun is out.\r\nKaoru: You're right. The morning sun's shining real bright.\r\nEllen: It's looking to be another good year. Happy New Year, Kaoru.

If that's how it is, I should be the one to host it.\r\nMaki: You'll host it, Yukari-sama?\r\nYukari: Miss Five Traditions was something I carried out. Which should make a recognition party my responsibility.\r\nSuzuka: In that case, I'll make arrangements for the location.\r\nYukari: Please do.\r\nYomi: Then, I'll take care of the food.\r\nYukari: Right.\r\nMaki: Yume and I will do something to cover for our regular duties.\r\nYume: If we're suppressing aradama, just leave it to me.\r\nYukari: Then, I'm depending on you.\r\nElite Guard: Yes ma'am!\r\n\r\nSana: You're doing a recognition party?\r\nYukari: I've already told Ema and the others.

Miss Ban and her team have done a good job!\r\nHiyori: She's right that this feels more like a game than usual training. This should make it easy for toji who don't like practicing to get into.\r\nKihiro: And it would be even more fun forming a party with friends~!\r\nKihiro: If I could request something, I'd want for it to be enhanced into a fully open world style VR game.\r\nKihiro: Add in a plethora of skills, and it would fly off shelves if put out for sale. Then research funds would come pouring in!\r\nHiyori: ...Leaving that aside, did you get any inspiration for making equipment?\r\nKihiro: I certainly did! The spark of inspiration's shining bright! My plan is to shut myself in the laboratory as soon as we return!\r\nHiyori: Alright.

You're working hard.\r\nMihono: But the harder we work on missions, that just means we spend more time in makeup classes. I'm not really okay with that...!\r\nKanami: They could at least give us a little bit of a break!\r\nMai: I think, even now, they might still be taking into account the rate of missions you're sent on for your makeup classes. Especially since you two often get assigned to suppress aradama.\r\nKanami: Even still!?\r\nMihono: That's too much~...\r\nMai: Maybe you're right. But, if you score well on your tests, I think there's a chance you'd have less makeup classes?\r\nMai: If you two both try your best, I think you can get even better grades.\r\nKanami: Mmm... On tests, huh...\r\nMihono: ...I think I'd rather do makeup lessons.\r\nKanami: But, it feels good not having to do any more for a while. After sitting down for so long, I want to get some exercise. So how about doing some swordfighting training after this?\r\nMihono: Ah, if that's what you're doing, then I'm going with!\r\nMai: You might not have extra classes, but we have our workplace experience trip tomorrow. Be careful not to overwork yourselves and sleep in too late, alright?\r\nKanami: Huh? Our workplace experience was tomorrow? I totally forgot...!\r\nMai: We're in the same group, Kanami-chan, so we have to meet tomorrow morning at 8 at the station. You're not allowed to oversleep.\r\nMai: Though, if you're not confident, I can go and wake you up tomorrow.\r\nKanami: Then... Please, Mai-chan! I'll probably be alright, but, just in case!\r\nMai: Sure, I'll be there.\r\nMihono: Where are you going for tomorrow's workplace experience?\r\nMai: A Japanese style diner. They open starting at noon.\r\nKanami: At a place like that, Mai-chan'd be a huge help right away!\r\nMai: I don't think there's any way I'll be cooking or anything. I think we're only serving customers and other simple tasks.\r\nKanami: I guess you're right.\r\nKanami: Where are you supposed to be going, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: I'll be at a kindergarten.\r\nMai: A kindergarten teacher, hmm. That might be perfect for you, Mihono-chan.\r\nKanami: Right? I bet the kids'll love her.\r\nMihono: Eheheh. You think so?

I'm normally only being served, so I never considered it much, but serving customers was more work than I thought.\r\nMai: And it was all so new to me, so I was a bit nervous to start.\r\nKanami: It was tough, but the meals they gave us were so tasty.\r\nKanami: After eating that, I felt like I could keep going on and on.\r\nMai: Me too. I can see why customers kept coming in one after another. And also, their uniforms were very cute, with their Japanese taste.\r\nKanami: I know what you mean! Wearing something like that was so different, so it was a lot of fun putting it on.\r\nKanami: Though, maybe I only felt like that because I was working all day today.\r\nMai: Maybe so.\r\nKanami: Have you thought about ever owning a restaurant like that in the future, Mai-chan?\r\nMai: I'm honestly not sure if I want to try owning a restaurant, but I feel like I have to fight to make sure people working that hard every day can live their lives in peace.\r\nMai: Doing this made me reflect on that all over again.\r\nKanami: Good point. It's our duty as toji, after all.\r\nKanami: It's still a long ways away, but, when I have to stop being a toji, what should I do?\r\nMai: For you, Kanami-chan, what about teaching at a swordfighting dojo?\r\nKanami: I love swordfighting, so that could actually work!\r\nKanami: But, would I really be able to teach all that well?\r\nKanami: It feels like I could teach more if we actually go okatana against okatana, like when my mother was teaching me.\r\nMai: If you taught someone, I have a feeling they'd grow into a strong toji.\r\nKanami: And then, after they're strong, they can come back and fight their master! That'd be exciting!\r\nMai: So, once they got strong enough, you'd fight your own pupils after all.\r\nKanami: Of course I would!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/kftrtt\r\n[Hostess - Kiyoka: Start]: I'm a Little Bit Nervous for Now...\r\n\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nMirja: Everyone did well on today's mission.

We got unlucky with our timing and missed a chance to have lunch.\r\nMirja: We're back at Renpu now, so what next?\r\nKofuki: It's hot out, so let's just stay at the lounge here.\r\nMihono: I'd be fine with that. But, Kiyoka, do you know any good places to eat nearby?\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nMihono: ? Kiyoka, are you feeling sick maybe? ...Are you okay?\r\nKiyoka: Eh.\r\nKiyoka: Ah... I'm not feeling sick or anything. I just kind of had something on my mind.\r\nMihono: We were talking about, if we can't come up with anything else, let's eat a late lunch in the lounge here.\r\nKiyoka: I think eating in the lounge is fine.

I have to go on the workplace experience trip. And I've been worrying and worrying about whether I can do it right...\r\nKofuki: What... that's it? Who cares; just do whatever. It's not like messing it up'll kill you.\r\nKiyoka: Honestly... You're so quick to say things like that, Kofuki-san.\r\nKofuki: You just worry about stuff too much.\r\nChie: That's enough, Kofuki-chan. Telling her that isn't going to help her.\r\nMirja: Where will you be going for your workplace experience, Musumi Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: It's a hotel, or, a ryokan. I'm meant to be working as a hostess... and I'm feeling a little hopeless about it now.\r\nMihono: Wait, really? If you're going to a ryokan, you'd get to eat yummy food and stuff, so isn't that pretty lucky?\r\nKofuki: Mihocchi...\r\nKiyoka: Even if it's only just for that day... If only I could turn into Hono-chan...\r\nMirja: Even if you can't be Asakura Mihono, it's important that you take a positive outlook like she has.\r\nMirja: Instead of setting out to do all of your work perfectly, why not just aim to do the tasks you want to do well on properly?\r\nChie: I agree. I don't think they'll be asking for students getting workplace experience to be perfect at their jobs.\r\nChie: So I hope, while you're working, you can find something you have fun with and that makes you want to keep at it.\r\nKiyoka: I'll try thinking about how to have fun with it like Hono-chan would.\r\nMihono: So wait; it kinda feels like I helped?\r\nKiyoka: You did, so thanks.\r\nMihono: You're welcome then!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Hostess - Kiyoka: End]: Hopefully it Goes Well\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Umm, this meal was for the room to the left of the one before--\r\nMihono: H-Help me, Kiyokaaaaaaaaa!!\r\nKiyoka: ...Hyau!?

Thank goodness.\r\nKiyoka: That weird dream was probably because I keep thinking about the workplace experience. I was even with Hono-chan, even though we're from different schools.\r\nKiyoka: Maybe I shouldn't have set the AC to shut off on a timer either.\r\nKiyoka: Let's turn the AC on and go back to sleep.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: So then, I thought I was in the middle of my workplace experience, but at the end... You were shooting a fire extinguisher, and everything went white. It was such a weird dream.\r\nKiyoka: And it woke me up and I couldn't get back to sleep last night. It gave me a lot of trouble.\r\nMihono: So that's why you were yawning before. But still, I know it's a dream, but none of that made any sense.\r\nKiyoka: It's all your fault, Hono-chan-. I mean, how did you turn food into aradama?\r\nMihono: How am I supposed to know! That was the just me from your dream!\r\nKiyoka: Fufu, sorry. By the way, where did you go for your workplace experience, Hono-chan?\r\nMihono: For my one, I went to a kindergarten. But it was pretty fun! I got to play around with the kids, and take a nap.\r\nKiyoka: You seem like you'd be really good at working with kids, after all.\r\nMihono: Yeah. We got along great. They told me to come back again, but I'm too busy with missions to stop by.\r\nKiyoka: ...It'd be a little hard to fit in, wouldn't it.\r\nMihono: Yeah, with school and missions and all. Maybe if I could take time off from class, but there's no way they'd let me.\r\nMihono: When you do your workplace experience in 2 days, it might be hard on you, but give it your best shot.

I just can't settle down.\r\nSuzuka: The ryokan Yume left for has been hosting students of the Five Traditions for their workplace experience for years.\r\nSuzuka: We only asked if they would kindly take in Yume, despite not being part of the Five Traditions, and Yomi-san even went along with her.\r\nSuzuka: Nothing of concern is going to happen.\r\nMaki: Well, you're right...

I've never really done this kind of thing before, so it feels sort of fresh!\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYomi: You don't often get a chance to work as a hostess, do you. This is my first time too, so it does feel fresh.\r\nYume: See~!\r\n\r\nYomi: There are no longer any signs of aradama in the area of the ryokan. Please rest assured.\r\nRyokan Proprietress: Thank you very much. It's such a help, having you two here.\r\nRyokan Proprietress: Because of you, our guests could go about within the ryokan without starting a panic.\r\nYume: No matter how many times aradama like that come along, I'll beat them right away, so you don't have to worry about it-.\r\nRyokan Proprietress: Fufu. Though, we would be worried, if aradama appeared that many times in the short time you're here.\r\nYume: Ah! I guess you're right.\r\nYume: Oh yeah. After we put on our hostess clothes, we were going to help out, but, what should we do?\r\nRyokan Proprietress: The work I'll have you do is nothing more than simple cleaning of the rooms, and a check over their furnishings.\r\nRyokan Proprietress: We have people hired to take care of the full cleaning, but this is one last check before the guests come through. Whoever is in charge will show you how it's done, so please work along with them.\r\nYume: Okaaay~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Hostess - Yume: End]: For the Special Menu!\r\n\r\nYume: I thought meeting guests and showing them their rooms felt like what a real hostess would do, but I didn't think, after we did it a couple times, they'd ask us to go pick vegetables next.\r\nYomi: They seem to have a special menu of vegetables grown here on the mountain they own that's served to guests who request it.\r\nYume: You think this is enough we've got-?\r\nYomi: It might be. It wouldn't be good if we gathered too many at once, so why don't we check with the ryokan for now.\r\nYume: Then, I'll go ask!\r\nYume: --Though, now that I'm looking closer... Onee-san. Were you picking only mushrooms? ...Why? Do you like them?\r\nYomi: There's no special reason. I just happened to. Though, these mushrooms have grown well.\r\nYomi: You could make a good soup stock from these shiitake, and their thickness would make them good for use in cooking.\r\nYume: I don't like them all that much, but, if the guests like it, it's fine.\r\nYomi: That would be best, wouldn't it.\r\nMaki: You look like you're working hard for the ryokan, Yume.\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san, Suzuka-onee-san!?

You hide colorful painted eggs in the park, and everyone competes to find them!\r\nKanami: That sounds fun! I knew you painted eggs for Easter, but I didn't know there was a game to look for them!\r\nEllen: For starters, the day before we do the egg hunt, do you want to make Easter eggs?\r\nKanami: Yeah, I want to try! I'll ask Hiyori-chan to come too!\r\n\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan wasn't in the classrooms or the dorms; I wonder where she went...\r\nEllen: Alright then, let's all get started making Easter eggs! Go ahead and draw nice designs on the eggs we have here!\r\nKanami: Huh? These eggs feel pretty light. What kind of eggs are they...? Wait, now that I look closer, there's a hole in the bottom and it's hollow inside! Ellen-chan, what'd you do with these eggs?\r\nEllen: We took out the insides earlier, with Saaya and Maimai helping me. It'd be a shame if any of the eggs broke halfway through.\r\nSayaka: It was a little hard to do... But it was fun.\r\nMai: Right now, Hiyori-chan is using the insides to cook for us. She'll be making a full course meal of egg related dishes for dinner tonight, so look forward to it.\r\nKanami: So Hiyori-chan was in the cooking room-? I wanted to make Easter eggs with her here though...\r\nEllen: I told her the same thing, but she said she's better at cooking than painting, so she wanted to be in charge of that...\r\nKanami: So that's why.\r\nEllen: It's too bad we don't have Hiyoyon with us, but let's go ahead and get right to painting the eggs! Here's pictures of examples for us to use.\r\nKanami: Wow, all the eggs look so cute and colorful!\r\nMai: There's a lot of bright, spring-feeling colors, so just looking over them feels exciting.\r\nSayaka: What do we do with these eggs after we finish painting them?\r\nEllen: We'll all go hide them in the park before tomorrow's egg hunt.\r\nMai: Though, with all these flashy designs, won't the eggs be found right away?\r\nEllen: There's plenty of colorful flowers in the park this time of spring, so they'll be harder to find than you think.\r\nKanami: Really? Then, I'll go with pink, and yellow, and greenish-yellow, and~!\r\nTsugumi: I thought it sounded lively in here. So you're all making Easter eggs?\r\nKanami: Tsugumi-san! Want to make some together with us?\r\nTsugumi: Thank you for asking. But I've already finished making my own custom made Easter eggs.\r\nTsugumi: I added something to them to make the egg hunt more exciting, so look forward to it.\r\nKanami: Ah, Tsugumi-saaan! ...She already left.

These clothes are so cute it's getting me worked up.\r\nMai: I know; the pastel spring colors give them all that cute touch. Though, I never knew there were Easter events you dressed up for.\r\nSayaka: I didn't either.\r\nEllen: The costumes aren't a must, but fancy hats and spring-colored clothes are another way to enjoy Easter.\r\nEllen: Kiyoka, Fukki, and Yuiyui worked their hardest to make these.\r\nKanami: Wearing these neat clothes and looking for eggs makes me feel like I just stepped into a picture book!\r\nEllen: It's about time we got started, but, Hiyoyon isn't here, is she?\r\nKaoru: I haven't seen her all morning. She might've burned out making that full course of eggs yesterday.\r\nKanami: The food last night was incredible too. I guess I'll have to work extra hard for Hiyori-chan today! I'll find a whole bunch and come in first-!\r\n\r\nEllen: Everyone, the egg hunt is just about over! Did you get a lot of hunting done?\r\nMihono: Totally! That was so fun, like a treasure hunt-.\r\nHiyori: Yeah, the most important thing is everyone had fun doing it.\r\nMai: Huh? Hiyori-chan, I thought you were taking the day off to rest. You sure have a whole lot of eggs.\r\nHiyori: Well... I guess I do. So, who's the winner of this?\r\nEllen: When everyone gets back, we'll count the eggs and decide a winner; though, in the meantime, how about we tidy up?\r\nEllen: It'd be an issue if we left eggs here in the park, so please check over everywhere you hid them.\r\nKanami: Okaaay! Hiyori-chan, let's go look together.\r\nHiyori: Sure.\r\n\r\nKanami: It looks like people got to all the eggs that I hid. Maybe where I left them was a little too easy to find. ...Huh?\r\nHiyori: Nn? Did you find something, Kanami?\r\nKanami: There's a ton of ducks under that tree over there. I wonder why?\r\nHiyori: You're right, it's weird to see that many gathered around. But why... Ahhh! The ducks are flocking around easter eggs.\r\nTsugumi: They're all eggs that I left there. I spread them out across multiple locations, but in no time there were ducks gathered around each.\r\nKanami: Ehh? What, does that mean the ducks were joining in on the egg hunt?\r\nTsugumi: That's about right. Actually, in order to make this event more exciting, I thought, wouldn't it be fun if animals were to join in too?\r\nTsugumi: So I coated the insides of the egg with ingredients giving various scents that animals love. But... I had no idea ducks would be this persistent.\r\nHiyori: Well, now's not the time to get impressed with it. We can't leave things like this; we have to hurry up and get those eggs back.\r\nKanami: You're right, but we're going to have to be brave enough to jump into the middle of all them.\r\nTsugumi: I'm sorry about this... I know; I have a good idea. I'll attract the ducks here using the scents I coated the eggs with, so could you use that chance to get the eggs?\r\nHiyori: Alright, so you'll be the bait. Let's go with that.\r\nTsugumi: Come here duckies, over this way. You all love the smell of this...\r\nHiyori: Okay, the ducks went after Tsugumi. Kanami, get the eggs in the basket while you can!\r\nKanami: Yeah. Ummm, one, two, three... Okay, I got them all!\r\nKanami: Whoa, I got surrounded by ducks! Save me, Hiyori-chan-!\r\nHiyori: Mmgh, are you alright, Kanami? Pass the eggs in the basket over here.\r\nKanami: Wahh! That duck took one of the eggs! Give it back-!\r\nHiyori: Hey, don't bite my basket! There's no eggs in this one.\r\nTsugumi: I wonder what's causing that? The ducks seem to be more attracted to the scent on the eggs than what I originally coated them with...\r\nKanami: WAHH!! I got the egg back, but now the pack of ducks are after me-! Hiyori-chan, pass!\r\nHiyori: Hey, Kanami! Don't go throwing eggs! And now the ducks are coming my way.\r\nTsugumi: The egg hunt turned out far more exciting than I was expecting, from the looks of it.\r\nKanami: Don't go sounding proud about it now-!

Wait, so what's no good then?\r\nTsugumi: The fact that I've been ignoring a possibility up until now, is all.\r\nTsugumi: I realized something. Haven't there been an awful lot of cases of aradama stealing things recently?\r\nTsugumi: And, from a possibility in that... I've formed a hypothesis!\r\nKofuki: Ooh, some new way to run into tons of aradama-chan!?\r\nTsugumi: Which is, is it possible that, when a subset of aradama steal objects from humans, they're wanting human attention?\r\nTsugumi: Even when aradama steal objects, I don't believe they use them in any way.\r\nTsugumi: What do you think, Shichinosato-san? About my \"attention seeking aradama\" theory!\r\nKofuki: You're looking all smug about it... but I really don't care.\r\nTsugumi: Ehh, but don't you think it's extraordinarily bad that something this vital was overlooked until now-?\r\nKofuki: I said I don't care! Did you call me here just to tell me that...?\r\nTsugumi: I'd like your help in collecting data on aradama, the same as usual-.\r\nTsugumi: To test my earlier theory, I think we'll need a certain amount of concrete data as proof-- for example, what do they actually steal?\r\nKofuki: So you're saying I'll get to play with loads of aradama-chan!\r\nTsugumi: Yes, though, the thing is... For this assignment, I'll need you to fight without bringing the aradama down right away, while limiting damage to the surroundings as much as possible.\r\nTsugumi: Because the primary goal of this is observation, not defeating the aradama. Can you work around that?\r\nKofuki: Hell no! Why do I gotta sit around waiting in a fight?\r\nTsugumi: If you hold yourself back a little, won't it feel 2-3 times more enjoyable when you do defeat the aradama?\r\nKofuki: Yeah right. Call me up when you're done with this watch-'n-wait borefest.\r\nTsugumi: Hmm, her reaction was within expectations. Though, collecting data on my own...\r\nTsugumi: The best case would be to find someone who might have a different sort of interest in aradama than Shichinosato-san...\r\nTsugumi: !\r\n\r\nEllen: So that's why you gave me a call then, Tsugumin!\r\nTsugumi: Yes, because of your personal views on aradama. I was sure you would be interested.\r\nEllen: Yes! This theory that aradama are stealing things because they want attention from people, it's very interesting!\r\nEllen: I think it sounds plausible too.\r\nTsugumi: If my hypothesis is correct, and there are aradama with the nature to seek out humans of their own accord, it may even be possible for some to be tamed as pets.\r\nEllen: That's right. It'd be wonderful if it could be more common for aradama to have relationships like Kaoru and Nene do.\r\nEllen: I'll help you with this, Tsugumin. Do you have any ideas where there might be aradama looking for attention?\r\nTsugumi: I've already taken care of researching that.

The theory's sounding more and more credible!\r\nTsugumi: Yes. It's considered impossible for aradama to grow accustomed to humans, but this shows promise, doesn't it-. I'm feeling inspired now-.\r\nEllen: Take a look at the lettuce scattered around here! It couldn't have happened naturally, and there's no signs of it being eaten!\r\nAradama: ......\r\nTsugumi: This looks to be a bingo, fufu.\r\nTsugumi: Though, you know, these aradama stealing crops and running off into the mountains are somewhat like monkeys, aren't they-.\r\nEllen: Like monkeys, we might be able to get along with them! Rather than a troupe of apes, it's a troupe of aradama!\r\nTsugumi: Gathering data here is a step towards that.\r\nTsugumi: If we can find something resembling an aradama nest here, we can investigate whether they've collected man-made objects and so on... Though maybe I'm hoping for too much just yet.\r\nEllen: We'll just have to pray we get lucky~.\r\nEllen: Let's close the distance quick so they won't escape, and get some data while we're at it!\r\nTsugumi: Woo-!\r\nTsugumi: That's how excited I am now, to shout that-.\r\n\r\nEllen: It looks like there's stuff besides stolen crops littered around.\r\nTsugumi: From what we've confirmed from missions so far, aside from sometimes stealing food, they also steal a variety of things, from items that cover daily needs to objects made of processed metals.\r\nEllen: We can't be sure the aradama are responsible for all of this, and I don't see any rhyme or reason behind it, but couldn't this be enough to say aradama are interested in humans, in a way?\r\nTsugumi: I think it's plenty of basis to do a practical test of our hypothesis with that aradama.\r\nAradama: ......\r\nTsugumi: Alright, let's get closer. If the theory holds up, so long as we don't attack, it should be fine.\r\nEllen: Come on, let's be friends!\r\nTsugumi: There's nothing to be afraid of-.\r\nEllen: We can get along with Nene, so surely other aradama can do it too...\r\nAradama: ......\r\nAradama: KSHAAAAAAAAA!\r\nTsugumi: ...So this was no good.\r\nEllen: That was even more shocking than getting attacked by aradama usually is...\r\nTsugumi: If more of them are coming out, we can't give up hope just yet!\r\nAradama: GUGGGGIII...!\r\n\r\nEllen: That was exhausting...\r\nTsugumi: They were all duds. I wonder if this hypothesis was incorrect... Either way, Kohagura-san. Thank you very much for joining me here.\r\nEllen: I had fun too, so it's no problem!\r\nTsugumi: That's good then. Still, for what reason do aradama steal objects-? Causing that much disturbance will mean toji are sent to exorcise them...\r\nTsugumi: Ah...! It couldn't be that they're doing things to draw attention so that they can be exorcised, is it...?\r\nTsugumi: Mmmghh...\r\nEllen: You sure are dedicated to this, Tsugumin.

That's a pleasant surprise-.\r\nTsugumi: I'd like to ask if we could share more information from now on, if that's alright with you, Kohagura-san.\r\nEllen: Of course it is!\r\nTsugumi: Good, this should help me make progress in data gathering.

I haven't changed a bit. It's not like, back then, I never had fun when I wasn't playing with aradama-chan or anything.\r\nMihono: I think you've changed a lot though? Like, when we first met, Kiyoka always stayed away from you, but it's not like that anymore, right?\r\nKofuki: I mean, you say that, but...\r\nKofuki: ...Have I really changed?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Misogi - Kofuki: End]:\r\n\r\nKofuki: I'm here-.\r\nTsugumi: Oh, you seem to be in a bad mood today.\r\nTsugumi: Did Asakura-san take your milk pudding again... No, you didn't get enough sleep, did you.\r\nKofuki: ...How'd you know that?\r\nTsugumi: You have bags under your eyes. It would be obvious to anyone.\r\nKofuki: ...Tch, you're too damn quick on the uptake.\r\nTsugumi: So, why weren't you getting enough sleep? Were you... No, you don't read books, do you?\r\nKofuki: Don't go deciding that on your own!\r\nKofuki: And anyway, it's all your fault!!\r\nTsugumi: Hm? It's... my fault?\r\nKofuki: Yeah it is. Cause you went and said I looked like I was having fun, it turned into this argument about whether I'd changed or not, and I felt too messed up to get any sleep.\r\nTsugumi: I'm having a hard time following, but... After I said you seemed to be enjoying yourself, you spoke to it with the investigation team, and they came to the conclusion that you've changed?\r\nTsugumi: ...Is that how it happened?\r\nKofuki: ...You got it.\r\nTsugumi: If you were that worried about something like that, then you really have changed, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: So what... You think I've changed too?\r\nTsugumi: I do.\r\nTsugumi: Of course you would change. Everyone is affected by the people around them.\r\nTsugumi: Even I've changed after becoming involved with the investigation team, wouldn't you agree?\r\nKofuki: I guess... Actually, did you change? Sorry, I don't really remember.\r\nTsugumi: ...Fufufu.\r\nTsugumi: It seems that the old Shichinosato-san really didn't think about anything besides aradama.\r\nKofuki: Well duh, wasn't that obvious?\r\nTsugumi: (On top of that, when everyone around you are people like me... It's only natural that it would change you.)\r\nTsugumi: Though, whether or not you change, you'll still be Shichinosato-san.\r\nTsugumi: I don't think you need to think so deeply about it.\r\nKofuki: You get real annoying when you're explaining stuff, y'know. Like, you're probably thinking you can spin me whatever bullshit, but I'm not letting you outta this one.\r\nTsugumi: I'm at a loss then...\r\nTsugumi: (I want to tell her that I think she's more lively before, and that she doesn't have to worry about unnecessary things, but... how would I get that across?)\r\nKofuki: Is that some aradama-chan!?\r\nTsugumi: Good timing.\r\nTsugumi: You do seem to be having the most fun whenever aradama appear. That part of you really doesn't change.\r\nKofuki: 'Course it wouldn't!

Seems like that'll be unlikely for a while.\r\nHiyori: But, assuming we could get a vacation, what would you want to do?\r\nKanami: Hmm... I'd want to go on a trip, I guess?\r\nHiyori: Going on a trip... That doesn't sound too bad. Would be nice to go to some hot springs and heal off all the daily fatigue.\r\nHiyori: Where do you want to go, Kanami?\r\nKanami: Hmm, let's see. I think I'd like to go on a trip overseas!\r\nKanami: Like, to the USA, for example. I'd want Ellen-chan to take me around to all the American dojos!\r\nHiyori: American dojos...? Well, that sounds like a trip you'd go on.\r\nKanami: I'll bet they feel different from the ones here in Japan, so it'll be fun for sure!\r\nHiyori: If you had Ellen with you, it'd probably get that much more noisy.\r\nKanami: And then, I'd want to go to the usual places, like Hawaii, and also, I think I'm interested in going to Europe too!\r\nHiyori: To see the dojos there too?\r\nKanami: Yeah! I want to check it out! Though, how much western style swordfighting do you think is still around in Europe?\r\nHiyori: As far as what level's still in practice... I'm not really sure.\r\nHiyori: Though, Europe refers to a big place. There's a lot of countries there, you know?\r\nHiyori: Was there any country you wanted to go visit in particular?\r\nKanami: Hmm, I guess I'd have to see England first? I want to go to London!\r\nHiyori: London... The most I know about it comes from Sherlock Holmes.\r\nKanami: Ah! Sherlock Holmes! That's good!

They're bound to have Scotland Yard's finest on security, so we'd better be careful.\r\nHiyori: ...If you're going to warn me to be careful, try not giggling when you do it.\r\nKanami: But, come on, they're going to have their top class guards stationed in there!?\r\nKanami: What kind of fighting style do you think they'll use?

And also, Holmes wasn't even there!\r\nKanami: Then maybe... Instead of working together, would it be a better setup if I came to steal you, Hiyori-chan?\r\nKanami: \"I've come to steal you away, Hiyori-chan!\" Like that.\r\nHiyori: Are you listening to me!?

I've never made something like this before, but you teaching me would be a good chance to learn. I'll be counting on you.\r\nMai: Sure!\r\nYui: Ah, you three were in here!\r\nYui: Happy Halloween~!

They said they had this and that.\r\nKanami: Ellen-chan said she'd be dressing up like a wolf, didn't she? Yui-chan, do you know? For Kiyoka-chan and everybody.\r\nYui: I told Kiyoka-chan she should dress up like a witch and little red riding hood, but she wouldn't wear those costumes in the end.\r\nHiyori: ...You gave her something weird to wear, didn't you?\r\nYui: Eh-- The skirt was just a liiittle bit short is all!?\r\nKanami: Ahaha... I'm pretty sure that's the reason.\r\nYui: But, I'd love to see Kiyoka-chan all dressed up in costume if I could. And Chie-san and Mihono-chan too, of course!\r\nKanami: I'm sure you would, Yui-chan.

I guess it's how they set it up, but it really looks like nighttime.\r\nKanami: They're probably trying to make it look more Halloween.\r\nHiyori: But, is this really alright? Us taking photos here.\r\nYui: Seems like it's fine. You can't see it from right here, but just under this there's a space and a fence to stop people from falling, just in case.\r\nKanami: Safety first, even when you're having fun.\r\nKanami: It'd be dangerous if little kids were jumping around, but a quick photo shoot should be fine.\r\nYui: So, Kanami-chan, strike a pose for me!\r\nKanami: A pose?

It would be terrible if you weren't there.\r\nYomi: Is that right... Then, I suppose I'll have to go. Is there anything I need to prepare in advance?\r\nMaki: It said on the invitation they're doing a gift exchange at the end of the party, so everybody needs to have one gift ready.\r\nSuzuka: With all the people that should be there, an exchange should be exciting. I should get mine ready straight away~.\r\nMaki: Wait up, Suzuka! I want your advice on what to go with. I'm coming with you!\r\nYomi: The two of them left. Sigh...

Something that, no matter how many people got it, they would be happy with... Like, for example, delicious white rice...\r\nYomi: Ah-! That's what I could do.\r\nYomi: I've reached a stopping point in my duties, so I'll quickly go out to do some shopping.\r\n\r\nYomi: I may have bought a bit too much, but I suppose I'll get right to cooking. It's a good thing the kitchen was available.\r\nEllen: Wow! Yomiyomi! I don't often run into you in a place like this~!\r\nKiyoka: Are we maybe getting in your way?\r\nYomi: No, it's fine so long as I can use the faucet and stove. You can use the next counter over if it's fine with you.\r\nKiyoka: Thanks for that then! Though, you sure have a lot of rice. And a nice big pot.\r\nEllen: Are you getting ready for the Christmas party or something?\r\nYomi: Yes, they said we would need something for the gift exchange, so I was thinking of using a type of rice that tastes delicious when cold to make omusubi.\r\nEllen: Wow! Now that's a coincidence~! Kiyoka and I were here to make sweets for the present exchange too.\r\nKiyoka: I'm baking cookies, and Ellen-san was going to make muffins.\r\nYomi: I see, sweets are a standard gift for schoolgirls. You do often see them decorated for Christmas on sale around town.\r\nYomi: To give omusubi as a Christmas present... Maybe what I'm making will be out of place.\r\nKiyoka: That's not true at all! Even with onigiri, depending on how you decorate them, they can definitely be cute Christmas presents!\r\nEllen: That's right~! Christmas style onigiri! If I got something like that, I'd be extra happy!\r\nKiyoka: Um, if it's alright, could we help you make them? We'll make a Christmas style onigiri bento!\r\nEllen: Definitely~!

It's a roll cake decorated to look like a log of wood.\r\nYomi: I see, a log of wood... If it were a sushi roll, I could make it look that way.\r\nKiyoka: It wouldn't be very Christmas-like though, would it.\r\nYomi: Since it's difficult expressing Christmas through the shape...\r\nKiyoka: I know! For Christmas onigi... Ah-! Omusubi! What about this? You could bring out the feeling with red and green ingredients.\r\nYomi: Red and green... In that case, I have umeboshi and shiyazuke for red, and shiso leaves for green.\r\nEllen: Both of those would go perfect with onigi... Rice balls!\r\nKiyoka: That was a nice save, Ellen-san.\r\nYomi: Thank you both. With your suggestions, I should be able to make these omusubi feel like Christmas.\r\nKiyoka: I'm glad we could help.

I'm looking forward to tomorrow.\r\nYomi: Thank you very much. Now I won't feel uncomfortable joining the party. Then, I'll be leaving now.\r\nKiyoka: Please wait a minute! Since we're exchanging gifts, it'd be a waste to leave it at that!\r\nEllen: For the exchange, you can't not wrap it up all cute~.\r\nYomi: You do have a lot of ribbons and wrapping paper.\r\nKiyoka: Maybe it would be cuter with a gap between the inside and outside! What do you think about this ribbon? Ah, or this one might be cute too!\r\nEllen: You always do have an awesome eye for design, Kiyoka~. Which do you like, Yomiyomi?\r\nYomi: I... think both are fine. I'll go with whatever you choose.\r\nKiyoka: Alright then!

It feels like you onee-sans have been really busy lately.\r\nYomi: Apart from our aradama suppression missions, there's always something to take care of.\r\nYume: But because of that, we haven't gotten to play at all. Or, actually, haven't we barely been able to get the four of us together lately?\r\nMaki: You're right. The rate of aradama appearances isn't dropping at all though. There's too much work needing toji to do it.\r\nYume: If it's aradama, then I can beat as many as I have to!\r\nYomi: It's reassuring to have you, Tsubakuro-san, but you can't respond to aradama appearing in multiple locations at once.\r\nYomi: Looking at the whole picture, even if you are very active, it won't reduce the overall work of toji that much.\r\nYume: Mmgh.\r\nMaki: Though, I get what Yume's saying. But it's hard getting all of us time off at the same time.\r\nYume: Then, it'd be fine if it's not when we have time off?\r\nYomi: ...What do you mean?\r\nYume: You'll find out later~.\r\nYume: There's something I've gotta go do real quick.\r\nYomi: What do you think she's up to?\r\nMaki: No idea...

Uh, Sandy.\r\nYomi: That was a joke.\r\nYomi: I wasn't sure what to expect when Tsubakuro-san invited us for training, but I didn't imagine we would be using the VR facilities.\r\nMaki: I'm still not completely used to this whole VR thing... But it's useful if you think of this as time spent strengthening the SDDT's coordination.\r\nMaki: Though, did it really need to be done up like Journey to the West...?\r\nYomi: This training program seems to be popular. And also, I think Tsubakuro-san is fitting for the role of the Monkey King.\r\nMaki: The Monkey King's wild and uncontrollable side might be a good fit for her. Though, I'm not that on board with me being Pigsy...\r\nYomi: Is it bothering you? I didn't think you'd mind. I've heard that Pigsy is a popular character in China.\r\nMaki: Is he really?\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nYomi: But, right now, there's something we have to do to break our master out, Pigsy.\r\nMaki: That's what I mean, calling me Pigsy is... Forget it... Let's go, Sandy!\r\nYomi: Please take point. I'll cover our backs.\r\nMaki: On it! We've got to make a diversion so the Monkey King can break out Master Tripitaka!\r\nYomi: Right, let's bring these bandits to justice.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: That was a rather worthwhile training session, wasn't it.\r\nYume: Yeah, it was pretty fun! Though, I was pretty surprised when you started beating bad guys up halfway through, Suzuka-onee-san.\r\nSuzuka: Since this was a training exercise, there was no need for a Tripitaka who did nothing but be protected, was there?\r\nMaki: Our Master Tripitaka's highly capable, after all. Those bandits shouldn't have let their guard down.\r\nSuzuka: I would have liked to have seen you two in action as well though, Pigsy, Sandy.\r\nYomi: In that case, should we continue this journey until the end?\r\nYume: I'm up for that! Let's keep going till we beat the Ox King!\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, Tripitaka's goal isn't to defeat the Ox King.

It'll totally be worth fighting her!\r\nMaki: You know we can't ask Yukari-sama to do something like that.\r\nYume: Ehhh, but you'll never know until we try asking!\r\nMaki: And anyway... Can they really recreate the story all the way to India?\r\nSuzuka: I haven't checked, but wouldn't it be like Ban-san to have gone into that much detail?\r\nYume: Yeah, I'm getting excited for next time~!"}, {"paste_key": "42zGHguD", "title": "5-5.2 Time Won't Stop", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/42zGHguD", "timestamp": "", "hits": "83", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://streamable.com/1ieuab\r\n3: A Private Conversation (1)\r\n\r\nChie: They're fast asleep now, aren't they. Even though they were so noisy all night.\r\nMirja: They must be tired. After all that's happened, I can't blame them.\r\nChie: Though, this works out well. There's something I wanted to talk about with you.\r\nMirja: It's about Asakura Mihono, isn't it.\r\nChie: ...What Makoto said... about Kanayamahime. Do you think it's true?\r\nMirja: This is only my personal opinion, but...\r\nMirja: That power going rampant... I find it easier to accept it as the power of an evil god than the power of an okatana.\r\nChie: That... makes sense.\r\nChie: What exactly... should we be doing? What could we do, to support Mihono-chan...\r\nMirja: ......\r\nMirja: There are too many unknowns right now that I don't know where to begin solving it.\r\nMirja: Let's ask for support from those around us while continuing to search through the records.\r\nMirja: And, while this may be coming too late, we need to keep close watch for any changes in Asakura Mihono...\r\nChie: How is that any different from what we were already doing!? That's what made Mihono-chan go to Makoto for help!\r\nChie: ...Ah. I'm sorry, for raising my voice.\r\nMirja: ...You don't need to apologize. I feel the same as you.\r\nMirja: However, we are also responsible for what happened with the Hitakamis, by allowing Asakura Mihono to move freely. We can't allow ourselves to make the same mistake again.\r\nChie: I know. Next time, I'll be there for Mihono-chan, no matter what.\r\nMirja: ......It isn't good to be overly eager about it either.\r\nChie: But, if this goes on and the great aradama awakens, there's no doubt Mihono-chan will be a target for suppression.\r\nMirja: ...It would come to that, wouldn't it. As a great aradama, Asakura Mihono would be threat to humanity.\r\nChie: I'm not going to let her end up like Yukari-sama did.\r\nMirja: ...We won't.\r\nMirja: First, we should look to the judgment of our superiors. ...Though I'd rather not. I wish I could keep this from being reported.\r\nChie: Even you're feeling that way, Mirja?\r\nMirja: Of course I am. What do you think of me?\r\nChie: Sorry, it's just a little unexpected.\r\nMirja: ...I understand that would only be running away from the issue, but I don't want this to become known by anyone.\r\nMirja: The response to Asakura Mihono carrying Kanayamahime is not going to be a lenient one...\r\nChie: ......\r\nChie: ...I'll help look through the records with you.\r\nMirja: That would help.\r\nChie: Do you think that... there's any way to pull Kanayamahime out of Mihono-chan, or make the seal stable?\r\nMirja: It's a slim chance to hope for. However, it's all we can do.\r\nMirja: That, and one more thing...\r\nChie: What's that?\r\nMirja: Should we remove Asakura Mihono from her duties?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/px00g3\r\n4: A Private Conversation (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Does that mean... you're taking me off the investigation team?\r\nMihono: But I don't want that! I want to stay with the team!\r\nMirja: Please calm down.\r\nMihono: Hey, say something too, Chii-nee!\r\nChie: Listen to us, Mihono-chan.\r\nChie: We aren't saying to take you out of the investigation team. It's the opposite.\r\nChie: We want you to support us, so that you can still stay in the investigation team.\r\nMihono: ...What does that mean?\r\nMirja: Going about it this way has two benefits. The first is... for political reasons.\r\nMihono: Political?\r\nMirja: Information about Kanayamahime will be reported to the government by the Sword Administration Bureau.\r\nMirja: That's where they would decide how to deal with you.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMirja: We want to lower your chances of being re-assigned somewhere besides the investigation team as much as we can.\r\nMirja: The fact that the investigation team has chosen this option, and that you would abide by it, shows the investigation team is trying to minimize the risk of the great aradama awakening.\r\nMirja: I am not sure if this is the best option... But, we want to do whatever we can, no matter how small.\r\nMihono: (The government...? The conversation's gotten so big my head's spinning...)\r\nMihono: (Umm... The government won't want the great aradama to wake up. That's what I want too...)\r\nMihono: (If that's the case, then... They might think it'd be better if I wasn't with the investigation team... Wait?)\r\nMihono: (Would it be better if I left...?)\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: What's the second one?\r\nChie: For practical reasons... We can buy a little more time for you.\r\nChie: The more time we have to find a solution for you, the better.\r\nChie: Though, you might be feeling worried in the meantime...\r\nMihono: (Chii-nee and Mirja-san are both thinking really hard of how I can stay in the investigation team...)\r\nMihono: (But...)\r\nMihono: Would it be better if... I wasn't in the investigation team?\r\nChie/Mirja: That's not true!/That isn't the case!\r\nMihono: ......\r\nChie: Please, Mihono-chan. At least until we can find a way to deal with this...\r\nChie: I want you to wait and believe in us.\r\nMihono: ......Okay.\r\nMihono: (It's alright. I know I can believe in you.)\r\nMihono: I'll be here to support you then!\r\nMihono: (I know they'll come up with a good idea, won't they...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/1pfc8d\r\n5: I'm Not Giving Up (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: I was always wondering. Why I was seeing this dream.\r\nMihono: I thought it was Kashuu Kiyomitsu showing it to me, but that's not it.\r\nMihono: You're Kanayamahime, aren't you?\r\nMihono: Why are you doing this to me?\r\nMihono: Give me an answer!!\r\nMihono: -!?\r\nMihono: You're attacking me? Now that I know what you are, you don't care what happens anymore?\r\nMihono: KYAH!?\r\nMihono: Uuu... This is just... too much...\r\nMihono: ...!?\r\nMihono: Urgh... The power, feels like it's going to burst out of me...\r\nMihono: I can't...! I can't lose control, not here...!\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan!? Are you okay in there, Mihono-chan!?\r\nMihono: Kanami?\r\nKanami: You're still conscious, aren't you?\r\nMihono: Yeah...\r\nMihono: Sorry, just give me a minute... If I move... right now...\r\nHiyori: Keep a strong grip on yourself!\r\nMihono: Juujou-san...?\r\nHiyori: Don't worry, we're here with you. So just focus on keeping your power in check.\r\nMihono: ......Okay.\r\n\r\nMihono: ......Okay, I'm fine now, I think.\r\nMihono: Sorry you had to wait, Kanami, Juujou-san! I'll unlock the door now.\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan... Are you fine now?\r\nMihono: ...Yeah.\r\nKanami: ...Thank goodness.\r\nHiyori: I was having breakfast with Kanami when something felt wrong.\r\nHiyori: I hoped we'd have come over here for nothing, but...\r\nMihono: ...\r\nHiyori: We've heard about how Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power is rampaging.\r\nMihono: Huh!?\r\nHiyori: I got a call from Kiyoka. She said you were in trouble. Asking if I knew anything that could help.\r\nKanami: And Kaoru told me, if I knew anything, I should go tell it to you.\r\nKanami: Mai-chan too, she said Sayaka-chan asked her about it.\r\nKanami: We're all worried about you, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: ......!\r\nMihono: (Kiyoka... Thanks, everybody.)\r\nMihono: ............\r\nMihono: Inside of me, there's a great aradama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/ac2s34\r\n6: I'm Not Giving Up (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: ............\r\nMihono: Inside of me, there's a great aradama.\r\nMihono: The two of you noticed something, right? That's why you came here all panicked.\r\nKanami: I had a kind of bad feeling about this... But I hoped it wouldn't be that...\r\nHiyori: The power of a great aradama... It's not something a person can keep under control. If it's not Kashuu Kiyomitsu, but a great aradama's power that you're losing control of... That explains what you're so worried about.\r\nMihono: ...Yeah.\r\nHiyori: A great aradama isn't something someone can resist for years and years. If that great aradama wakes up in you... If you can't keep a firm resolve, you won't be able to hold onto yourself.\r\nMihono: ............\r\nHiyori: ...Ah, I'm sorry. This isn't something you need to be hearing right now.\r\nMihono: No, I get it...\r\nMihono: It's just... Why did all this have to happen...\r\nKanami: This great aradama, it was always with you, wasn't it, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah...\r\nKanami: Would it be possible... for you to try getting along with it, or something?\r\nMihono: I don't really know, but...\r\nHiyori: I won't tell you that's impossible, but... I don't agree with the idea. The moment the great aradama awakens, it's possible Mihono's sense of self will be snuffed out. You shouldn't take this lightly.\r\nKanami: Ah... Sorry.\r\nMihono: It's alright! I know that you're thinking about how to help me, Kanami!\r\nHiyori: Mihono. Was there anything passed down for times like these, to deal with the great aradama?\r\nMihono: ...I don't think there is.\r\nHiyori: I see. Though, you should try asking at least.\r\nMihono: O-Okay, I'll ask Grandpa about it.\r\nHiyori: And also... Don't give up hope.\r\nMihono: Huh?\r\nHiyori: The unease you're feeling... I know it too well.\r\nHiyori: But, you have friends with you. The investigation team, and us too, we'll do everything we can to help you.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan's right! We'll look and see if there's some way to stop this too!\r\nMihono: ...Thanks, Kanami, Juujou-san.\r\nHiyori: Sure.\r\nHiyori: (But, if it comes down to it, I'll be the one to...)\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: ...It's nothing. Anyway, we were in the middle of breakfast, weren't we?\r\nMihono: ...Ah, my stomach started rumbling as soon as you said breakfast.\r\nHiyori: It's better if you can stay that relaxed for now. I know it must be hard, but don't dwell on it too much.\r\nMihono: ...Okay.\r\nKanami: So then, let's all have breakfast together!"}, {"paste_key": "ja3PfXaZ", "title": "Toji no Miko Idol Project", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/ja3PfXaZ", "timestamp": "", "hits": "96", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/2aeYuGyp6Rs\r\n\r\n1: Forming an Idol Unit!?\r\n\r\nOne day, after school, Mihono was called into the office.\r\n\r\nMaki: Good, you're here, Asakura Mihono. We're going to have you handle a request from the Sword Administration Bureau's Public Relation's department.\r\nMihono: A request from the PR department?\r\nMaki: That's right. You know the Five Tradtion's Unified Cultural Festival will be held soon, don't you?\r\nMihono: Yeah, even we're talking about it a whole bunch. Like, what it's going to be like this year.\r\nMaki: On stage at the cultural festival, they'd like for there to be a performance with singing and dancing-- which you'll be in charge of.\r\nMihono: H... HUHHHHHHHHHH~~!? I'll be on stage?\r\nMihono: Wait, and singing and dancing... Is that like an idol!?\r\nMaki: It's reasonable to be shocked hearing this. But, this request comes with a legitimate purpose behind it.\r\nMaki: For us to continue our work as toji, it's vital that we have the people's understanding on our side.\r\nMaki: We can't be an unapproachable organization. Don't you think we need to show our friendly side sometimes, planning things like this to improve our image?\r\nMihono: Th-That makes sense... The more you talk about it, the more I'm starting to get a handle on it.\r\nMaki: It might sound like a crazy idea, but this assignment has gotten approval from Yukari-sama herself. Be sure you take it seriously.\r\nMaki: Now, there's no limit to the number of people who can join you on stage, but, if you get a good reception at the cultural festival, you'll be routinely asked to join in future events.\r\nMaki: So choose your members carefully. It'd be best to pick people you know closely and can work together well with.\r\nMihono: Okay! I never thought I'd be becoming an idol, but... I'm starting to get kinda excited.\r\nMihono: I'm sure that, where there's a will, there's a way! I'll try my best to liven up the cultural festival!\r\n\r\nMihono: So anyway, guys! Please help me out-!\r\nChie: Asking us to do idol activities is a a little surprising... Though, maybe she's right that showing that side of ourselves will make people more comfortable with us.\r\nMirja: I think you made the right decision bringing this to us. We'll be able to make use of our usual coordination as members of the investigation team on stage.\r\nKofuki: If it's a mission then there's not a whole lot we can do about it, but what a pain in the ass. All I wanna be going after is aradama-chan.\r\nTsugumi: You truly have a one track mind, Shichinosato-san.\r\nYui: Mfufu~, so basically, this means I'll get to see all of you dressed up like cute idols, right? In that case, it gets a total OK from me!\r\nKiyoka: (E... Everyone looks like they're kind of enjoying this...)\r\nKiyoka: (But, just imagining singing and dancing in front of people is enough to make my heart pound...)\r\nKiyoka: (There's still time before the cultural festival though... If I practice a lot, even I should be fine, right...?)\r\nMihono: Alright then, let's get started right away! We'll practice singing first!\r\nKofuki: So wait, why's Mihocchi acting like we all decided she'd be leader?\r\nMihono: Heheh. That's because I want to be the center of our idol group! That means I've gotta be the leader, right?\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono has an appeal that draws people in. She would be an ideal leader for idol activities.\r\nYui: That's for sure-. Though, I feel like, deciding on the center is a totally different issue.\r\nMihono: You mean you don't think I'm good enough to be the center!?\r\nMihono: Uuuu, I'll have to work hard to build up your faith in me first...\r\nChie: For now, let's use our free time starting today to do singing and dance lessons.\r\nTsugumi: We still have our usual missions to take care of, so this could get busy.\r\nMirja: Additionally, if we are acting as idols, we should begin by spreading recognition of us as a group.\r\nMihono: We should?\r\nMirja: Yes. I can imagine a large difference in the excitement at our performance depending on how well our name is known. Which is why it's essential for us to prepare a space to announce our unit's formation.\r\nMirja: To that end, this may sound sudden, but we should begin planning our debut live. As soon as we settle on the details, we will make an announcement and carry it out.\r\nKiyoka: Ehh!? A-Already!?\r\nKofuki: Why bother doing anything we don't have to-? You're making more work for me here too.\r\nKiyoka: (I-I still don't feel prepared for this at all either...)\r\nKiyoka: (How is this going to go for us...?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: We're Now in Special Training!\r\n\r\nMihono and the others spent days doing idol activites alongside their usual aradama suppression missions.\r\n\r\nMirja: With this, the aradama have been fully eliminated. Good work.\r\nYui: Kofuki-san, the way you were moving during the fight was really idol-like. You're actually getting pretty into that, aren't you?\r\nKofuki: Huh? As if. We just keep doing those dance lessons every day, so it comes out sometimes with how my feet move.\r\nYui: I want to get a recording, so do it one more time for me please! With a big bright smile, if you can!\r\nKofuki: I'm not doing it! And don't record anything!\r\nChie: There are times when your dance moves start to become a sort of habit though, aren't there?\r\nMirja: It feels as though my body is lighter on my feet than before. You could say that's an unexpected benefit.\r\nKiyoka: (Everyone's already gotten used to our idol activities, but I'm still not even close...)\r\nKiyoka: (I have to at least try hard enough not to hold them back...)\r\n\r\nMihono: Alright! Suppressing aradama's over with, so let's start our lesson-!\r\nMihono: We can start off with dancing today. Everybody, try to match me!\r\nMirja: I see Asakura Mihono is motivated. Is that how much she wanted the position of center?\r\nChie: As soon as she makes up her mind, Mihono-chan's motto is to leap before she looks. I'll have to work hard too, as her onee-san.\r\nYui: One, two... Ah, I did it really good just then! I think I'm getting a lot more used to dancing-.\r\nTsugumi: That's true. At this pace, we could be plenty ready for the main performance--\r\nKiyoka: KYAA...!?\r\nMihono: Kiyoka! Are you okay?\r\nKiyoka: I-I'm sorry. I can't follow the choreography right for some reason...\r\nKofuki: You're stiffening up too much, Kiyoka. This part's not really that hard, so just take it easy.\r\nKiyoka: Okay...\r\n\r\nMihono: ...Phew, I think we can call our lesson there for today. Great work, guys-!\r\nKiyoka: Good work. Um, I'll be leaving early...\r\nKiyoka: (What should I do... Like I thought, I'm the only one weighing everyone down...)\r\nKiyoka: (Maybe it would be best if I took myself out of the group, before I bother everyone even more...)\r\nYui: Kiyoka-chan's looking like something's got her down. You think she's still feeling nervous?\r\nMirja: That's more than likely the case. From our pitch lessons, she's already struggling to bring out her voice.\r\nChie: If only she didn't worry herself so much over it...\r\nMihono: Worry herself so much?\r\nChie: Mmhm. She left early again today.\r\nYui: She might be trying to make it so she can leave the group.\r\nMihono: She can't do that! It's the big cultural festival, so we have to make it all work together!\r\nMihono: If she's worried about messing up, I do that all the time, so she shouldn't let it get to her. We've gotta catch up to her quick and convince her!\r\nTsugumi: I think that would have the opposite effect. It's possible it would make her more worried.\r\nMirja: In that case, why not try giving her a different sort of assignment, to get her mind off it?\r\nMirja: Even the slightest change of pace could make her feel surprisingly more at ease.\r\nKofuki: If that's what we're doing, what if we let her mess around with the stage outfits and stuff? She's into clothes, right?\r\nMihono: Fukki... That might be a great idea!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: You want me to arrange everyone's outfits?\r\nMihono: Yeah. Our outfits for this were provided by the Five Traditions, but they said we're allowed to make some changes to the designs.\r\nMihono: Since you know a lot about fashion and stuff, I really wanted you to be in charge of it... But, what do you think?\r\nKiyoka: Nnn~...\r\nKiyoka: (Right now, I can't be useful when it comes to singing or dancing. So, if I can at least help with the outfits...)\r\nKiyoka: Alright... If you're fine with me doing it, I'll handle them.\r\nMihono: Really? Thanks a bunch!\r\nKiyoka: (With this... Even if it's only a little, I hope I can help everyone.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Toji Idols, Beginning Activities!\r\n\r\nTo get ideas for arranging the outfits, Kiyoka and Mihono went window shopping.\r\n\r\nMihono: Leave it to Harajuku to have shops everywhere!\r\nMihono: It's been a while since I went to check out western clothes, so this is sorta fun. Ah, look at that, Kiyoka. That skirt's so cute!\r\nMihono: It really feels girly~, y'know? What do you think about making our outfits more like that?\r\nKiyoka: I do think it's cute, but... With Mirja-san wearing them too, I think it might be better for our outfits to be a little more adult.\r\nMihono: Hmhm, I got it. Then, how about the clothes over there?\r\nMihono: It has that, \"grown up woman!\" feeling to it. Isn't that cool?\r\nKiyoka: You're right. Mirja-san or Chie-san would probably look great in it. I think would shine on stage too.\r\nKiyoka: But... This time, I feel like it might not look quite as good on the two of us.\u3000Kind of like we're trying too hard.\r\nMihono: Mmm, you have a point...\r\nKiyoka: Ah, look at that, Hono-chan! That outfit!\r\nMihono: Wow, that's so pretty looking...!! I'd love to wear something like that...\r\nKiyoka: With this, I'm sure it could look great on everyone! Maybe it'd be good to arrange the outfits like that.\r\nKiyoka: We can leave the silhouette as-is... For the length of the skirt, can we go even shorter?\r\nKiyoka: We can make it easier to move in, to fit us better... Mm, this could work! When I get back, I'll try this design out straight away!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan! What do you think of this?\r\nMihono: ---! That's good! That's so good, Kiyoka!! I'm so glad you're a part of this!!\r\nKiyoka: ...You think so? But, all I've been doing is holding the group back.\r\nMihono: If you weren't here, we'd be in a lot of trouble with the outfits. See, you know how my suggestions always miss something.\r\nKiyoka: Even if I weren't here... Kofuki-san has great fashion sense, so I'm sure you would have come up with something.\r\nMihono: But, we wouldn't have come up with this design, would we? And I really like the look of this!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan--\r\nMihono: When you were thinking about how to do the outfits, your face was all bright and cheery.\r\nMihono: You've been doing so many things you weren't used to lately, so I think it must've been tough on you, but it's like you forgot all about that now.\r\nMihono: See, Kiyoka. Even if you mess up a little when you're singing or dancing, as long as you can have fun with us like you were now, it's all okay!\r\nMihono: I think doing that would be a lot more like your usual self.\r\nKiyoka: Having fun, with all of you... Ah!\r\nMihono: What's wrong?\r\nKiyoka: Well... Once before, I was part of a maid cafe.\r\nKiyoka: And I just remembered, back then too, when I had fun, it turned out really successful.\r\nMihono: See what I mean! So, we should all do this together!\r\nMihono: You're really charming when you're having fun! We all like you when you're staying just like that!\r\nKiyoka: Thank you, Hono-chan... for telling that to me.\r\nKiyoka: I'll keep on trying. I'll try my best with everyone!\r\n\r\nKiyoka's design arrangements were incorporated into the outfits with the Five Traditions' approval-- and were officially provided for each member.\r\n\r\nAnd then, the day of their debut live came.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: There sure are a lot of visitors gathered.\r\nYui: Are you doing alright, Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKiyoka: Yeah... I'm feeling very nervous, but I'm fine.\r\nKiyoka: I want to have fun together with everyone...!\r\nMihono: That's the spirit, Kiyoka! Alright, let's go!\r\nMihono: Hello, and nice to meet you-!\r\nMihono: Thank you all for coming today-! We'll sing the best we can, so please listen!\r\nKiyoka: A-Ah...\r\nMihono: Kiyoka, let's sing into the same mic together! Here~!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan... Okay!\r\nKofuki: Gimme some room, Kiyoka. The crowd totally eats up ad-libbing like this!\r\nYui: Ahh! No fair, squeezing your way in-! Let me in there too-!\r\nKiyoka: Fwahh... Y-You're too, too close...!\r\n\r\nWith the help of the other members, their debut live managed to be a hit.\r\n\r\nMihono: Great work, guys-! Thanks for giving it your all!\r\nMirja: The audience was very excited as well. If we continue with this practice, I think we'll be able to put on an even better performance at the main stage.\r\nMihono: All we've gotta do for the cultural festival is keep on practicing, right! ...Wait, hang on?\r\nMihono: I got a text on my phone... H-Huhhh!?\r\nChie: What is it, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Chii-nee... See, it's not just us who's going to be idols at the cultural festival...\r\nMihono: Kanami and the members of the elite guard have started doing it too...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: We're All Doing a Review Session!\r\n\r\nThe next day--\r\n\r\nMihono: I'll say it again, we all did great yesterday! Our debut live was a whole lot of fun!\r\nMihono: And so, this might feel a little soon, but I thought we could do a review session of our first live performance. Let's all bring up stuff we noticed!\r\nChie: Well then, I think we pulled it off very well. We might not be used to acting as idols, but we all managed to keep singing properly until the end.\r\nKofuki: And my ad-libbing got the crowd way into it! Going up and shouting in front of a bunch of people honestly felt pretty good.\r\nYui: I'm feeling extra satisfied too, after getting to different sides of you all than usual! I got to press up real tight against Kiyoka-chan while we were singing too!\r\nKiyoka: That was sort of embarrassing... But, I think it was also a little reassuring.\r\nMirja: It's certainly good that we were able to conclude our live performance without any issues. I'm in agreement. With our current skill level, there was likely a chance we could have embarrased ourselves.\r\nMirja: Next, let's investigate what things we did wrong.\r\nTsugumi: In that case, I have some to start with.\r\nKofuki: What, you got something to complain about...?\r\nTsugumi: They're not from me. I meant from the audience.\r\nTsugumi: I had them fill out a survey after the show, and there were several comments that read: \"Disappointing,\" \"Go practice more,\" \"I honestly expected too much\"..\r\nMirja: Then, that means we should strive to improve the quality of our performance.\r\nKofuki: What'd they even think was so bad? There wasn't really anything we need to fix.\r\nMirja: That's not true. For both our dancing and our singing, our skills are still underdeveloped.\r\nMirja: Etou Kanami and the elite guard have also begun working on stage for the cultural festival. In other words, we need to compete against them to win.\r\nKiyoka: In that case, we can't be satisfied just because we can manage this... That's what you mean, right?\r\nTsugumi: One solution is to continue our practice daily. Though, I'm unsure if that alone will be enough to win over the audience.\r\nYui: Win over the audience, huh... If we could do that, we'd already be like pros.\r\nKiyoka: Ah, maybe we could do more ad-libbing, to make it feel more like a live performance?\r\nChie: But there's also a chance of us messing up with those, so I don't think it's a good idea to do it too much.\r\nKofuki: Who needs a plan or whatever. Keeping up with it's way too annoying.\r\nMihono: (I had a lot of fun at yesterday's show, and I thought we put in a really good effort...)\r\nMihono: (I guess we really do still have a long ways to go...)\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan, you in here?\r\nKanami: Wait, you're having a meeting!? Sorry...!\r\nMihono: What'd you need, Kanami?\r\nChie: It's alright, come on in.\r\nKanami: Thanks. Then, I'll only take a minute.\r\nKanami: Actually, yesterday, I saw your live performance.\r\nKanami: And, since it put me in a good mood, I thought I'd come and thank you guys.\r\nMihono: I-It did?\r\nKanami: Yeah. You were all shining up on stage, and I thought you looked incredible.\r\nMihono: Thanks, Kanami. I'm glad we could help somebody out.\r\nKanami: I didn't say that much... Did something happen?\r\nMihono: Well, kind of... See, it doesn't seem like the audience's reactions were all that great.\r\nKanami: That's not true at all! All the people around me were smiling!\r\nKanami: We're normally protecting the people by cutting down aradama with okatana, but...\r\nKanami: I thought, it's amazing we can help them smile in a different kind of way too!\r\nMihono: You were thinking that, Kanami...? That sorta makes me feel better.\r\nMihono: But, when you say all that... It makes me want to go see your performance too.\r\nKanami: You want to see our performance?\r\nMihono: Yeah. I'm just picturing how shiny you guys must look up on stage.\r\nMihono: I bet you'd look pretty amazing.\r\nKanami: Nnn~... Then, how about we do a live show together next time?\r\nKanami: We might be rivals in the main performance, but I want you to see us on stage too!\r\nMihono: A show together... Yeah, that sounds good!\r\nMihono: Maybe we're on different teams, but we still feel the same about wanting to make people smile. Let's both try our hardest and make this show the best!\r\nKofuki: Now we're doing something annoying again. Gimme a break. I mean, are you guys really up for this?\r\nChie: Of course I'm fine with it. We should train lots for this joint-live.\r\nYui: I can't think of anything better than getting even more pretty girls up on stage!\r\nKiyoka: You never change, do you, Yui-chan.\r\nMihono: Okaaay, let's do our best for the joint-live-!\r\nEveryone: Yeah-!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: An Idol's Special Move?\r\n\r\nMihono: Alright, match your steps to mine-!\r\nMihono: If you're even a little off, it'll definitely stand out, so we've gotta focus!\r\nKiyoka: O-Okay-!\r\nTsugumi: This is some fairly hard choreography, isn't it.\r\nMihono: You're doing good, we're getting the motions right! Okay, now for the last set!\r\n\r\nMihono: Alright, that's it for today's lesson! Great work-!\r\nYui: Nice job~. Phew, it's really starting to feel like we're in special training mode here.\r\nMirja: We can't show Etou Kanami and the others a poor performance. It's not unreasonable that the practice would become harder.\r\nMihono: That's right, we've gotta practice a lot so we can get even better!\r\nMihono: But, I was thinking, it'd be nice if we had some kind of \"ace up our sleeve\" that'd boost up our performance.\r\nChie: An ace up our sleeve?\r\nMihono: Yeah. Like, a special move or something.\r\nKofuki: Do idols even do stuff like special moves?\r\nMihono: W-Well, I don't know.. But, if we don't do \"something\", I feel like we won't win over the audience.\r\nKiyoka: Like a finishing pose?\r\nYui: Or if we take off enough clothes so that it's just risky enough, and hit them with sex appeal.\r\nMirja: Stop that right there, Yamashiro Yui.\r\nKofuki: Ugh, this is all so dumb. I'm not putting up with any more of this.\r\nKofuki: Oi! Get some aradama-chan for me. I need to blow off stress!\r\nTsugumi: I suppose you can't help it.\r\nKiyoka: Those two left...\r\nMihono: Yeah... But, it's not like Fukki's wrong, since we don't even know if we can come up with an \"ace up our sleeve\".\r\nMihono: Though, if we just keep going like this and don't make it in time for the cultural festival... Nngh~...\r\nMihono: (Maybe we just aren't cut out to be idols after all...)\r\nMihono: (No... That can't be right!)\r\nMihono: (Kanami said watching our performance made her feel better. There's got to be some way for us to make people smile!)\r\n\r\nWhen the next day's lessons were starting.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Kofuki-san... She didn't come today.\r\nChie: Mm, that's worrisome...\r\nMihono: Since last time, I've been trying to think of a performance that'll make Fukki want to do it, but I can't really come up with anything.\r\nMirja: If there were a dance closely related to the suppression of aradama, I'm sure Shichinosato Kofuki would feel motivated.\r\nMihono: Nnn, but, is there one...\r\nMihono: Ah-!\r\nMihono: Hey, everybody! I just thought this up, but--\r\nMihono: What if, when we were dancing on stage, we used some toji techniques!?\r\nKiyoka: Used them... Like, how exactly?\r\nMihono: Like, if we used jin'i to move really fast!\r\nMirja: I see. A dance applying toji powers would certainly draw attention.\r\nTsugumi: If that's what you're after, then let's use the data I've been accumulating.\r\nTsugumi: If we can make use of combat formations in a dance and refine them, aradama suppression should go more smoothly in the future.\r\nMirja: However, it sounds very difficult to manage.\r\nMihono: But still, I'm sure we can find a way to make it work!\r\nMihono: Alright! With this, we can win over Fukki!\r\n\r\nKofuki: Huh? You're using jin'i in a dance? So what?\r\nMihono: We're basing it off the combat data Tsugumi-san has, so the better our dance gets, the better we should be able to beat aradama from now on!\r\nMihono: I think it'll be great for you too, Fukki, but what do you think!\r\nKofuki: Beat aradama by dancing... Ahahaha! What the hell! That's way too funny, Mihocchi.\r\nKofuki: Fine, I'll go be part of this special training of yours!\r\nMihono: Ah... Thanks, Fukki!\r\nKofuki: Still, you must've thought pretty hard about all this just to win me over.\r\nMihono: That's cause I want to be idols with you!\r\nMihono: Alright, let's get back to everyone fast and try this out!\r\n\r\nMihono: Ready; here we go.\r\nMihono: Focus your mind, and... Uwahh!?\r\nChie: Are you alright, Mihono-chan!?\r\nMihono: Yeah... I should've known, dancing this part while holding onto an okatana is tough when you're not used to it.\r\nMihono: But, I'll keep trying... Where there's a will, there's a way!\r\nMihono: If we can match the timing of our dancing, this'll...!\r\nKofuki: Oi oi, don't go pushing it too hard, Mihocchi.\r\nMihono: I'm fine, Fukki... I want to master this dance, whatever it takes.\r\nMihono: That way, I can put smiles on the faces of everyone who comes to see us...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Kanami and Mihono's Joint-Live\r\n\r\nAnd so the day of Mihono and Kanami's teams' joint-live arrived.\r\n\r\nYui: Ooh, there's a whole lot of people here!\r\nKiyoka: I-It's making me nervous~.\r\nMihono: I'm counting on you today, Kanami.\r\nKanami: I'm counting on you too, Mihono-chan. Let's both make this a great live show!\r\nHiyori: It's time to show the results of all the practice we've been doing. Let's give it our all, everyone.\r\nSanae: You sure are motivated, Juujou-san. I sort of wasn't expecting that from you.\r\nHiyori: I'm not motivated, this is just our mission to do this.\r\nMai: We'll have to do our best too, Sayaka-chan.\r\nSayaka: Mm. I'm excited to be on stage with you, Mai.\r\nKaoru: Since there's this many people here, isn't it fine for me to head back home-?\r\nEllen: Yeah, yeah, we're already starting, Kaoru. Our team's up first, so here we go!\r\nKanami: Everybody-! Thank you all for coming today-!\r\nKanami: I hope you'll enjoy our performance!\r\nKiyoka: Wow... They're incredible...!\r\nMihono: Both them and the audience look like they're having a lot of fun...\r\nYui: Ah, did they slip up a little just now? Where their dance came together.\r\nChie: Their singing too, there's times when their pitch is off. Though...\r\nMihono: Yeah. Just watching them, it's like my heart is dancing...!\r\n\r\nMihono: You did great, Kanami! It was really really good!\r\nKanami: Thanks! You're up next, Mihono-chan!\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono, about the dance involving jin'i, what should we do?\r\nMirja: In practice, we were never able to maintain the dance until the end. As our leader, I leave it to you whether or not we use it in our performance.\r\nMihono: Hmm... Nnnn~...!\r\nKofuki: Oi, we're up already!\r\nMihono: Nnn~~, this time, we'll dance without using jin'i!\r\nMihono: We can't bring down the whole joint-live if we screw it up.\r\nYui: Got it-! That makes us on even terms with Kanami and them.\r\nKiyoka: L-Let's do the best we can, Hono-chan-!\r\n\r\nMihono-chan and the others headed out before the audience, and their performance began.\r\n\r\nMihono: (Huh...?)\r\nChie: (We are making mistakes, but... Hasn't our dancing improved since our first live...?)\r\nKiyoka: (Maybe this is because... of what we learned practicing dancing using jin'i.)\r\nKofuki: (Haha, my body's moving really good. This'll work.)\r\nYui: (Rather than just dancing like we usually do...)\r\nMirja: (As you'd expect from applying our combat data to our choreography, these movements are now optimized for us.)\r\nTsugumi: (If it could give off this much of a different impression, it was well worth providing the data.)\r\nMihono: (All our breathing is in sync too! Okaaay...!)\r\n\r\nKanami: Ah, Mihono-chan and everybody are back. Nice work-!\r\nMihono: Thanks, Kanami! But... The audience seemed a little more into it when you guys were up there.\r\nKanami: That's not true at all! They were just as excited to see you!\r\nMihono: Nah, that's not it. You could tell right away just how much practice you guys have done.\r\nMihono: Compared to that... We've actually been practicing for a special move.\r\nKanami: Special move!?\r\nMihono: Yeah, a jin'i dance! Though... it didn't work out in the end.\r\nMihono: But, if you dance together with the people you're really close with and reach out to each other, you'll definitely end up in perfect sync.\r\nMihono: We kinda took the long way getting here, but I finally get it.\r\nMirja: Compared to our previous live show, I believe we're showing steady improvement. There's no need to push ourselves.\r\nYui: Alright, let's keep giving it our best from here-!\r\nKiyoka: Huh... Doesn't it look like people are gathering over that way for some reason?\r\nKofuki: It's the weekend and all, so there's probably something exciting going on.\r\nMihono: I wonder what... We should go check it out too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: After Hanging Our Heads\r\n\r\nMihono: You think they're doing some kind of event over here too?\r\nMirja: It seems they will soon be conducting a band contest. There was a poster over there.\r\nKanami: You didn't know, Mihono-chan? This is...\r\nEllen: Stop, Kanamin! They'll know in a minute, so it'll be more fun if we don't say anything!\r\nMirja: What do you mean by that?\r\nEllen: I'm sure this'll be a good surprise~.\r\nKiyoka: What do you think they're up to, Hono-chan?\r\nMihono: Hmm~... Maybe Kanami's team's going to keep their live show going over here?\r\nKofuki: That's all you can come up with!? The poster said it's a band event!\r\nYume: Huh-? What're you onee-sans here for?\r\nMihono: Eh... Y-Yume-san?\r\nSuzuka: Well now, all of you are here as well. It's good to see you.\r\nSuzuka: Have you already finished with your live show?\r\nMihono: Yeah, just a few minutes ago. And then, there was a big commotion over here, so...\r\nMaki: I see; you came at the right time. I wanted you to be here to see our music performance.\r\nMihono: Music performance?\r\nMaki: We didn't tell you, but... We've been preparing something a little different.\r\nMihono: Wait, does that mean...\r\nSuzuka: Yes, we've formed a band. We'll be participating in this live show here.\r\nYume: We wanted to test our skills-. And, of course, we aren't planning on losing either!\r\nMihono: Eh... EHHHHHHHHHHHH~!? The elite guard formed a band!?\r\n\r\nStudent 1: Hey, did you go see the elite guard's band live yesterday?\r\nStudent 2: Of course I did! It was just incredible!\r\nStudent 3: They were all so skilled on their instruments that my ears were melting...\r\nStudent 4: We'll have to go support them when the cultural festival comes too!\r\n\r\nMihono: Wherever you go, everybody's talking about yesterday's band live, aren't they.\r\nMihono: But we tried our hardest doing our own live too, y'know.\r\nKofuki: You tell 'em, Mihocchi! Can't believe they went out of their way to do their live right after ours!\r\nChie: Their performance was impressive... So there's nothing we can do about it. The four of them were completely in tune with each other.\r\nMirja: Having both true talent and existing popularity, it's only natural they would overshadow us.\r\nMihono: Reality is cruel...\r\nYui: C'mon and cheer up, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Yui...!\r\nYui: The elite guard's band was seriously the best! There's no way anybody wouldn't love it!\r\nKofuki: Oi, we've got an enemy among us.\r\nMihono: Because of Yui, I'm feeling even worse now.\r\nKiyoka: B-But, don't you think that, we shouldn't need to worry about it that much?\r\nMirja: It would be more appropriate to say that worrying about it won't do us any good.\r\nMihono: I get that and all, but... Sorry! \r\nMihono: I'm gonna go take a walk to clear my head a little!\r\n\r\nMihono: Sigh, even though I know we've gotta be working hard now... It sort of just feels like I can't focus on anything.\r\nMaki: Asakura Mihono? Weren't you doing practice?\r\nMihono: Shidou-san... and the rest of the elite guard too.\r\nYume: Don't tell me, you're taking the day off? You onee-sans suck enough already, so you're not gonna make it if you don't practice a bunch-.\r\nMihono: Ugh... I was, just...\r\nMihono: Oh yeah, your performance yesterday was really great!\r\nMihono: Everybody in the audience got totally wrapped up in your music!\r\nYume: Heheh, course they were. Cause, it's our band and all. We signed up at the last second, but it was really fun!\r\nSuzuka: It was a challenge keeping within their restrictions though. Really now, if only a certain someone wouldn't make such hasty decisions...\r\nMaki: Ugh, sorry about that.\r\nMaki: But, look at how hard our kouhai are working to liven up the cultural festival.\r\nMihono: Huh...?\r\nMaki: You're staying back late every day to practice, aren't you? When I saw that, I decided to put us in the contest.\r\nMihono: You were watching us, Shidou-san...?\r\nMaki: We're all toji. We have our missions, and we need to train ourselves to see them through.\r\nMaki: If I'm being honest... I used to be against this assignment too. But, that's not the case anymore.\r\nMaki: There isn't a lot of time before the main event, Asakura Mihono. Let's both of us aim to make it the ultimate show.\r\nMihono: Okay... Thanks a lot!\r\nMihono: (What was I getting so down in the dumps over... If I want to beat somebody tough, all I have to do is train harder than ever.)\r\nMihono: (Alright~, I'm gonna head back to school now and work even harder-!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: In Order to Surpass the Best\r\n\r\nKanami: What's up, Mihono-chan? You're in a real hurry.\r\nMihono: Ah, Kanami! Actually, right now, we're...\r\nMihono: Wait, I know! You should come be in the meeting too, Kanami!\r\nKanami: Meeting?\r\nMihono: Yeah, our meeting!\r\nMihono: Ah, but I guess it's no good with just you going. You should ask Mai and everyone to come!\r\nKanami: That's fine, but, what's it about... And she's already gone. What kind of meeting are we having?\r\n\r\nKanami: So anyway, Mihono-chan. What's this meeting about?\r\nMihono: I want us to think together about how we can make the ultimate live show!\r\nMihono: Actually, to tell the truth, I just came up with it!\r\nKofuki: When you say \"just came up with it\"...\r\nKiyoka: This meeting has started off an awful lot like Hono-chan.\r\nTsugumi: That's right, we'll be aiming to make use of the jin'i dance, won't we. And you called Etou-san and the others here to gather fresh data.\r\nSanae: A jin'i dance does sound kind of fun. Don't you think Juujou-san could be able to make it work?\r\nHiyori: Y-You think so?\r\nMihono: We're not doing the jin'i dance, okay!?\r\nMihono: ...Umm, I think everybody here heard the elite guard's music performance, but it was pretty great, wasn't it?\r\nMihono: All of us want to make the show a success, and have everybody clapping and smiling for us, and everybody talking about us the next day at school, right!!\r\nMai: That would be great, but... How are we going to go about doing that?\r\nMihono: Let's hold a training camp! All our group and Kanami's group too!\r\nEllen: A joint-training camp... That's not a bad idea. If we do lessons together and help build each other up, I'm sure we'll get our skills to an even higher level!\r\nMihono: Right?\r\nMihono: There's no time left before the main event. But still, we've gotta improve some more if we're going to be ready.\r\nMihono: Which means... We've gotta do everything we can!\r\nChie: You always get like this... You decide things on your own without explaining anything, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Sorry about that, Chii-nee.\r\nChie: ...It's fine. So long as you're feeling better, I'm happy with whatever you decide.\r\nKaoru: ...Sigh. This sounds like too much work, but I'm not gonna be able to get out of this, am I?\r\nSanae: I think I'm up for it too. And I'd like to ask more about your jin'i dance when we have a break.\r\nSanae: Juujou-san, do you want to try it with me?\r\nHiyori: Well, why not. There's no harm in trying.\r\nMihono: Shidou-san told me they're gonna make it the ultimate show. So then... we should all make it even better than ultimate!\r\nKanami: Better than ultimate... Sure! For some reason, that gets me really pumped up!\r\nKanami: Let's all train together until we get so good that even the elite guard can't believe it!\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the training camp--\r\n\r\nEllen: Okay, attention, everyone! Please try matching my actions!\r\nEllen: Wave your hands even wider... Good! With that, let's take a rest.\r\nYui: Phwahh~. That lesson was pretty hard.\r\nChie: It really is a big help having Ellen-san as our dance coach.\r\nEllen: You're all so serious about this, so I feel even more energized than usual! Let's both support and teach each other new things!\r\nKofuki: Aghh, I'm beat. What about you, Mihocchi? You feeling it?\r\nMihono: Mmm, I feel like, if we do lessons with Kanami and them, we'll definitely level ourselves up.\r\nMihono: But I know for sure Shidou-san and them are out practicing too... It makes me a little nervous...\r\nTsugumi: They won't be such easy opponents to catch up with, after all.\r\nTsugumi: As we improve here, they'll be improving too... It's a nice, stimulating relationship.\r\nMirja: There's no reason to panic. This is our only course of action right now, so we should simply steadily push on.\r\nMihono: Alright! \r\nTsugumi: I've just recieved a message. It seems like there's been an aradama outbreak nearby.\r\nKanami: We're sortieing then. Let's all go! We have to beat the aradama quick, so we can get back to our lessons!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: The Center's Decided!\r\n\r\nMihono: --HAAHH!!\r\nMihono: Kanami, cover my back for me!\r\nKanami: Leave it to me!\r\nMihono: They're coming from that way too; watch out!\r\nKanami: Okay-! Back me up, Mihono-chan!\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono and Etou Kanami form a fairly advanced combination, don't they.\r\nKaoru: They haven't even been doing this for that long, but they're totally in sync.\r\nMihono: (It's kinda weird...)\r\nMihono: (With both of us leaving our backs to each other like this, it's like I can tell right away what kind of moves Kanami wants to make next.)\r\nKanami: Nice assist, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: You're... welcome-!\r\nMihono: (If I could work this smoothly with Kanami, while we're on the same idol team together...)\r\nMihono: (I bet we could put on an even nicer performance.)\r\nMihono: (----...)\r\nKiyoka: Wow... Hono-chan and Kanami-chan are amazing together...\r\nChie: I know. Even though they're fighting, they move so beautifully... I can't take my eyes off them.\r\nHiyori: It's like the two of them are dancing with each other.\r\nKanami: This should be--\r\nMihono: The end of them-!!\r\n\r\nTsugumi:  --Good work, everyone. Leave the cleanup work to me.\r\nKanami: Phew... Mihono-chan, thanks for back there!\r\nMihono: Yeah, I know...\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Let's do it together, Kanami! Let's be idols together!\r\nKanami: You mean... You want us all to go up on stage together?\r\nMihono: If we all form one big idol group, I'm sure we can make it the ultimate show!\r\nKiyoka: H-Hold on, Hono-chan. We can't just decide that all of a sudden...\r\nChie: Wouldn't it be hard for us all to coordinate?\r\nMihono: Where there's a will, there's a way!\r\nMihono: And besides, it's not like this is coming from nowhere. We're already seeing the training we did together pay off.\r\nMihono: You can tell from the mission we just did! We knew just what to do with each other, right?\r\nKanami: You're not wrong... When we were fighting now, I felt like I could naturally tell everything Mihono-chan was going to do next...\r\nKanami: If we could take that feeling up on stage at the cultural festival... We could make it the ultimate show!\r\nEllen: Dancing with a big group sounds like fun! I think it's a nice idea!\r\nKaoru: It's not like we've got anything to lose. I don't care either way.\r\nMai: I'm excited to see what the stage will look like if we go out there with Mihono-chan and everyone.\r\nSayaka: If Mai wants to do it, I do too.\r\nYui: All of a sudden we've doubled up the cuties. You know I'm all for it!\r\nMirja: It seems that we've already settled on this.\r\nMirja: At the same time, it appears we've also found our new team's center.\r\nChie: That's true. Between all the girls here, I think Mihono-chan and Etou-san have the best coordination.\r\nChie: Though, everyone else was working together much better during the fight just now...\r\nChie: But I think you two should be our center during the cultural festival.\r\nMihono: Eh!? Y... You're fine with that?\r\nChie: Of course I am, but you wanted to do it yourself, didn't you, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: I did, but, I thought for sure we'd do auditions or something to decide the center.\r\nKofuki: It's not like anybody's against going with Mihocchi. I'd actually be annoyed if it came around to me.\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, when you were fighting just now... You already looked like idols, it was so amazing!\r\nMirja: We'll all support you two as best as we can.\r\nMihono: Kanami and me as a double-center...\r\nKanami: Let's give it our best shot, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Yeah-! Thanks, everybody!\r\n\r\nAfter the training camp was over, Mihono went straight to report to Maki.\r\n\r\nMaki: Okay... So you and Etou Kanami's teams will be performing together.\r\nMaki: The main performance'll be something to see.\r\nMihono: You can count on us! We'll put on the ultimate performance, so good it'll make you and the elite guard smile too!\r\nMaki: Us too?\r\nMihono: Yeah!\r\nMaki: ...Good then.\r\nMaki: The cultural festival is almost here. I'm looking forward to standing up on the same stage as you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: The Unified Cultural Festival Starts!\r\n\r\nAnd so the day of the cultural festival came--\r\n\r\nKanami: Wow~... There's just so many stalls and attractions set up!\r\nMihono: I know! Everything's so lively that I'm having fun just looking around.\r\nKanami: I'm glad we had a bit of spare time here-. Otherwise I wouldn't have gotten to tour around with you, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: We went in that haunted house, and we had yakisoba from that stand together.\r\nMihono: And after this...\r\nKanami: Are you thinking about how we have to go on stage, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Yeah. It's like I can't help but keep coming back to it.\r\nMihono: Who'd have thought we'd be getting up on stage together, Kanami?\r\nKanami: It's pretty exciting, huh Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: It's exciting, but I'm nervous too.\r\nMihono: ...Hey, Kanami. You think the guest'll be happy with our performance?\r\nKanami: We tried our hardest, so I'm sure we'll do fine.\r\nKanami: And, you know, where there's a will, there's a way... right?\r\nMihono: Yeah... That's right!\r\n\r\nChie: Ah, Mihono-chan. Over here.\r\nMirja: They asked for the performers to wait here until it's their turn on stage.\r\nStudent Host: Err, now then, the stage event for the Five Traditions Unified Cultural Festival will start from here!\r\nStudent Host: Opening the show will be everyone from the elite guard!\r\n\r\nMihono: Th-Those cheers are crazy...!\r\nMaki: Thanks for coming to see us, everybody.\r\nSuzuka: I hope you'll all enjoy the show till the end.\r\nYomi: Is everything ready?\r\nYume: Then, let's get going-! One, two...!\r\n\r\nYui: They've started, but, this is...\r\nKofuki: Did they bump up the quality even more since last time we heard them?\r\nKiyoka: Tsubakuro-san's singing voice is so pretty...\r\nMirja: Konohana Suzuka's guitar finds the melody, and Satsuki Yomi's bass guitar sets the tempo.\r\nMirja: Finally, Shidou Maki's drumming supports them all.\r\nHiyori: They must have practiced seriously for this.\r\nKanami: Yeah, and when they're so busy usually. That's incredible.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, these guitars are rather passionate and exciting to play.\r\nSuzuka: You seem to be striking a steady chord with your bass as well, Yomi-san?\r\nYomi: Yes, just as we practiced.\r\nMaki: I'll push up everybody's performance from behind. Go ahead and let it all out.\r\nYume: Thanks, Maki-onee-san! C'mon, lets get things even more rocking here-!\r\n\r\nKanami: They put on a great show, didn't they, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Yeah-- But, I'm not gonna let it get to me anymore.\r\nMihono: We'll win over the audience when we put on our ultimate performance!\r\nKaoru: Our turn's almost up-; you ready to go?\r\nEllen: It feels like the music from their performance is still echoing on stage though...\r\nKanami: That's just what we want! Let's go, everybody!\r\nAcademy Announcement: We have confirmed the appearance of aradama in the area of this academy. All toji are to prepare for immediate sortie. I repeat. We have confirmed the appearance of aradama--\r\nMai: Oh no... We were just about to go up on stage too...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: What We Protect\r\n\r\nSuzuka: For aradama to appear with this many people gathered together; the timing couldn't be worse.\r\nMaki: They're not going to give us a choice. Our circumstances don't mean a thing to them.\r\nYomi: Their numbers seem to be in the hundreds, and large-scale aradama have been confirmed.\r\nYume: That's a whole bunch-! Though, I'll get all of them myself anyway!\r\nMaki: Suzuka, Yomi, and I will guide the civilians to safety. All remaining toji, suppress the aradama! Move out!\r\n\r\nYui: So does this mean the stage show's getting cancelled in the end?\r\nMirja: ...For now, we should eliminate the aradama as quickly as possible.\r\nKanami: Let's go, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Yeah!\r\n\r\nKofuki: Phew... Man, that was a hunt.\r\nKiyoka: It doesn't seem like any of the civilians were hurt, so that's good~.\r\nSanae: I wonder if any aradama are left. With this many of us here, it was over in a flash.\r\nHiyori: That's for sure. Though... Was it because we're all prepared for the show? Everyone's movements were sharper than usual.\r\nEllen: Leave it to Hiyoyon to notice something like that! Actually, these clothes that we're wearing were designed by Grandpa!\r\nKaoru: Weird-. So even the old man got involved?\r\nEllen: \"You might have to end up fighting while wearing these... Alright, I'll see a little of what I can do,\" said Grandpa, and he got a spark in his eyes!\r\nHiyori: So, what does that mean for us?\r\nEllen: With some tamahagane used in some decorations, when used together with an okatana... Would you believe it! Some of your powers get a boost!\r\nEllen: ...Or there's a chance that could happen!\r\nKaoru: What is this, another test operation? Does he think we're guinea pigs?\r\nHiyori: ...Either way, it's true that these uniforms helped us out. They seem like they'll let us show some extra effort during the show too.\r\nAcademy Announcement: In regards to the stage event that was to be held at this academy, we are currently discussing whether it will be re-opened. Please wait a moment--\r\nTsugumi: There's a good chance the stage show will be cancelled, isn't there.\r\nKaoru: Aradama were rampaging around just a couple minutes ago. They can't come to a decision that easy.\r\nMihono: I know there's nothing we can do about it, but still... I don't want it to get cancelled.\r\nMihono: We went through all that practicing, so I want everybody to see.\r\nSanae: Isn't it kind of noisy over that way?\r\nChie: What could be going on? Let's go see where the voices are coming from, Mihono-chan.\r\n\r\nSpectator 1: Ah, there's the girls from before!\r\nMihono: Eh?\r\nSpectator 1: Thank you so much for saving us! Thanks to you, my daughter and I were able to get to safety!\r\nSpectator 2: You girls are doing the stage show too, aren't you? I've been looking forward to it!\r\nSpectator 3: I went to see their live show in town once before, and it was really good!\r\nSpectator 4: Do your best out there-!\r\nMihono: Everybody...\r\nMaki: It sounds like lots of people have seen just how much effort you've put into this.\r\nAcademy Announcement: We have an announcement to make. After discussing it, we have now decided to resume the stage show.\r\nAcademy Announcement: We hope you continue to enjoy the Five Traditions Unified Cultural Festival--\r\nMihono: W-We're doing it... We get to go up on stage...!\r\nMaki: Go and show everything you've accomplished with your training.\r\nMihono: We will! We'll put on the ultimate show for you, so please watch us!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: The Ultimate Show!\r\n\r\nChie: There's only a few minutes before we go up on stage.\r\nYui: Ahhh~, I'm so glad the show didn't get cancelled!\r\nYui: After all the practicing we did, it'd be way too sad if it ended like that.\r\nKiyoka: Ah... Thinking about how we're about to go out there, I'm sort of getting butterflies in my stomach...\r\nMihono: It'll be fine, Kiyoka. We can do this.\r\nKofuki: We got through all those annoying lessons. There's no way we'll mess this up.\r\nMirja: There's no doubt that we should have the talent for it.\r\nChie: All that's left is for us to go up on stage and give the best performance we can.\r\nYui: Just be cute, have fun, and sing!\r\nTsugumi: It's nearly time for us to go.\r\nKanami: Let's go, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Kanami... Yeah! Let's make this the ultimate show together!\r\n\r\nMihono: Thank you all of you for coming to see us; I mean it-!\r\nMihono: When you came to the festival and said you wanted to see our show... It made me suuu~per happy!\r\nMihono: We've been working to put on the kind of show that'll cheer up anyone who hears it... That, even if something sad happened, it'll clear it all away.\r\nMihono: We're gonna sing the best we can, to make all of you smile!\r\nKaoru: Ohh, those're some good cheers-.\r\nEllen: We can't let the audience beat us! Let's get even more excited than that!\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan, I'll follow your lead, so move however you want.\r\nSayaka: Mm, thanks, Mai.\r\nHiyori: Alright, next it's our turn to show off.\r\nSanae: Mmhm, let's give it our best shot, Juujou-san!\r\nMihono: Nnn~~~, I never knew it felt this good being up on stage!\r\nMihono: Everybody, thank you so so much cheering us on this whole time!\r\nMihono: Okay, here comes the climax, Kanami!\r\nKanami: Yeah, let's stick together and give it one last burst!\r\nMihono: All my friends on stage with me, and everybody who supported us... I love each and every one of you!\r\n\r\nMihono: Uhh, so anyway... Good work, everybody!\r\nEveryone: Good work-!!\r\nMihono: Because of you guys, we made this the best festival ever! So let's have fun at the afterparty too-!\r\nMai: That was a wonderful performance you gave, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Eheheh, thanks, Mai! It felt so good being out on stage too!\r\nEllen: I think we have what it takes to be idols! Should we all debut together?\r\nYui: Would that get us up close and personal with real idols!?\r\nMirja: When that time comes, we can leave Yamashiro Yui out of it.\r\nYui: You're so mean~.\r\nKiyoka: Fufu.\r\nKiyoka: ...I was really nervous, but now that it's over, it was fun.\r\nChie: You tried harder than everyone, didn't you, Kiyoka-chan.\r\nKiyoka: I did everything I could so I wouldn't hold you all back.\r\nKiyoka: Did you have fun too, Chie-san?\r\nChie: Yes, of course I did!\r\nKofuki: Hey, this idol thing wasn't so bad. I got to play with a bunch of aradama-chan too.\r\nTsugumi: Though, there's no connection between idols and aradama.\r\nMaki: Sorry to interrupt you while you're enjoying yourselves.\r\nKanami: Shidou-san! What brings you here?\r\nMaki: We asked the visitors to vote on \"which group hyped up the stage the most\", and I came to share the results with you.\r\nMaki: Congratulations, Asakura Mihono. The award goes to your group.\r\nMihono: E-EHHHH~~!? Our group won!?\r\nMihono: We did it... We did it, Kanami!!\r\nMihono: Getting to stand on stage together was so much fun. Thanks so much for being there with me!\r\nKanami: I feel the same way, Mihono-chan!\r\nYui: That's crazy, that's crazy-! I'm so glad we won!!\r\nChie: I really am glad to hear it! This just goes to show how many smiles we put on people's faces!\r\nEllen: There's no way we can't celebrate this, Chie! Let's order an extra large cake to share!\r\nKaoru: You're gonna order one now!?\r\nMai: Oh well, it is time to celebrate, isn't it?\r\nKofuki: Ugh. Well, I guess it doesn't feel too bad.\r\nSayaka: You're not being honest, Kofuki.\r\nTsugumi: That's right. You could show some more happiness.\r\nKiyoka: W-We had to go through a lot, but, I-I'm so glad...!\r\nSanae: Ahh, there there, don't cry.\r\nHiyori: Here, take my handkerchief.\r\nKiyoka: ...Thank you!\r\nMirja: This just means all your efforts have paid off.\r\nMaki: And, with the results here, Asakura Mihono's team will periodically continue their activities as an idol group.\r\nMaki: We'll be counting on you in the future.\r\nYui:\u3000Ooh, that means I'll get to see everyone in their cute outfits again! Nice-!\r\nKiyoka: I'm glad we got to make so many people happy, but, getting up on stage again... I'm a little nervous about things will go...\r\nKofuki: Can I only go do it when there's aradama-chan around?\r\nMirja: I won't let you slack on your duties, Shichinosato Kofuki.\r\nMirja: Our lessons could also apply to suppressing aradama, so let's work hard at being idols again.\r\nMihono: You know, I had so much fun doing this festival today!\r\nMihono: So the next show, and the show after that, let's all work together to do our best!"}, {"paste_key": "BHaVq1ff", "title": "Summer Memories", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/BHaVq1ff", "timestamp": "", "hits": "101", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/7q5s6NyENVM\r\n\r\n1: Straightforwardness at Summer's End\r\n\r\nKofuki: Oiii, you in here-?\r\nTsugumi: Oh, what brings you by, Shichinosato-san? We don't have any aradama disposal planned for today.\r\nKofuki: It's too hot outside, so I stopped by to cool off.\r\nKofuki: You got anything cold in here? Like, ice cream or something.\r\nTsugumi: It's almost October too, and yet it's still as hot as ever.\r\nTsugumi: If you're fine with barley tea, I can get some for you.\r\nKofuki: So that's a no on the ice cream? Fine, that works too.\r\nKofuki: Ah, but you'd better not put anything weird in it!\r\nTsugumi: I've never once put anything weird in anything...\r\nTsugumi: Here you go.\r\nKofuki: Try thinking back over the stuff you've done...\r\nTsugumi: Hmm... I have no memory of that.\r\nTsugumi: Ah, when you need to, if you could refill it yourself.

For that same reason, these reports have been building up.\r\nKofuki: Hmmm.\r\nKofuki: ...\r\nTsugumi: What's the matter?\r\nKofuki: If you weren't working with the investigation team, you wouldn't have to deal with those, right?\r\nKofuki: Isn't that a pain in the ass?\r\nTsugumi: No, I find it fulfilling.\r\nKofuki: ...Is that right.\r\nTsugumi: Yes.\r\nKofuki: My sweat's cooled off, so I'm gonna get going now.\r\nTsugumi: Sometimes, it seems like you've mistaken this for a cafe, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: It's close enough.\r\nKofuki: Seeya around, Tsugumi.\r\nTsugumi: ...\r\nTsugumi: So... you do remember my name.\r\nKofuki: What're you talking about?\r\nTsugumi: This is the first time you've called me by name...\r\nTsugumi: It's startling when you do things like this, so please keep the surprise attacks to a minimum.\r\nKofuki: Huhh!? There's no way I haven't said your name at some point!!\r\nTsugumi: No, as far as I can remember, this is the first.\r\nTsugumi: Here, come on, try saying it one more time.\r\nKofuki: I'm not gonna!\r\nTsugumi: Come on now, \"Tsugumi\", like that.\r\nKofuki: Who cares! \"You\"'s good enough for somebody like you!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: An Unchanging Relationship\r\n\r\nYui: Today it's just me and you shopping together, Kiyoka-chan!

You know I'll pick out the per~fect~ clothes~ for~ you!\r\nKiyoka: Ughh... It's true that I have faith in your fashion sense...\r\nYui: I've already inputted Kiyoka-chan's tastes and the current fashion trends! The only data I'm missing is...\r\nKiyoka: Wh-What's that look in your eyes for? You're giving me a bad feeling about this...\r\nYui: The latest specs on Kiyoka-chan's body!\r\nKiyoka: Eeeeep!?\r\nYui: Where's the harm in it! Where's the harm in it!\r\nKiyoka: There's plenty harm in it! You're scaring me, so stop it!\r\nYui: Ahaha.\r\nYui: It's been a while since we got to hang out with just the two of us, so I couldn't hold back my excitement.\r\nYui: I'll pick out clothes normally for you, don't worry.\r\nKiyoka: ...\r\nKiyoka: Do you mean it?\r\nYui: Have a little faith in me!\r\nYui: Like, for example... The outfit that's on display there, I bet it'd look great on you!\r\nKiyoka: ...It's true that I like the look of it... But this is why you're so...\r\n\r\nYui: Finished putting it on yet-?\r\nKiyoka: Not yet-. Just wait a little longer-.\r\nYui: I can't wait!\r\nKiyoka: KYAAAAAAAAAAAA!?\r\nYui: ...Well, huh. Your clothes are on.\r\nKiyoka: What were you going to do if they weren't!?\r\nYui: I'd apologize!\r\nKiyoka: Don't sound so proud about it!\r\nYui: Ahaha, sorry, sorry.\r\nYui: Since it's been so long since we got to do this, I'm so happy I just can't help it.\r\nKiyoka: ...That's right, it has been a long time.\r\nYui: Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKiyoka: ...Sorry, what's gotten into me. Umm, what I mean is, it's just...\r\nKiyoka: Just...\r\nYui: You're crying!? I-I'm sorry, Kiyoka-chan!\r\nYui: I went a little too far, didn't I? I didn't mean to make you cry or anything...\r\nKiyoka: That's not it, that's not why...\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan, I'm so glad...\r\nYui: Huh?\r\nKiyoka: After you became a Myouga toji and came back... I wasn't sure if we'd ever get to have fun like this again...\r\nKiyoka: That's why, I really am happy...\r\nYui: Kiyoka-chan...\r\nKiyoka: [sniffle...]\r\nKiyoka: Sorry, I'll be fine now.\r\nYui: Thanks for that, Kiyoka-chan.\r\nKiyoka: Yeah.\r\nYui: You love me as much as I love you, huh!\r\nKiyoka: ...Eh?\r\nKiyoka: No, that's not what I meant...\r\nYui: Now that I have your consent, I'm going to get even more touchy feely from now on!\r\nKiyoka: Just stop doing thattt!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Memories in the Lingering Heat\r\n\r\nAradama: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nYomi: Shidou-san, Konohana-san, Tsubakuro-san.

This is so boringgg.\r\nMaki: Yume, there's no fun or boring when it comes to missions.\r\nSuzuka: She's right, Yume.\r\nYume: You don't have to tell me that.\r\nYume: But still, I can't help it if I'm getting bored.\r\nMaki: Honestly...\r\nMaki: Suzuka and I'll go report we've finished suppressing them. Yume, you take Yomi and go on back ahead of us.\r\nYume: Okaaay.\r\n\r\nYomi: I've returned.\r\nYomi: ...Where are Shidou-san and Konohana-san?\r\nYume: Making a report.

It's tickling the bottom of my feet!\r\nYomi: ...Please be careful for jellyfish.\r\nYume: It's fine, it's fine! Anyway, you come on in too, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYume: It's nice and cool!\r\nYomi: ...Alright then.\r\nYume: Awww, summer's almost over and we didn't even get to play around that much.\r\nYume: The four of us have been doing missions this whole time!\r\nYomi: It's to improve the reputation of the special defense team.\r\nYume: I know that and all, but, since the four of us were all here, I wanted to play around a little!\r\nYomi: ...So long as I can be useful with this power, that's enough for me.\r\nYume: You take everything too seriously-.\r\nYomi: But this is the reason I returned to you all, and joined the special defense team.\r\nYume: See what I mean, you're being too serious. You could just say you're happy the four of us get to be together.\r\nYomi: ...It isn't as if I'm not happy to be working together with you again.\r\nYomi: But, I abandoned all of you before.\r\nYume: Yeah, you did.\r\nYomi: And, for her sake, I'm sure I would as many times as I had to...\r\nYume: I don't really care though. It doesn't matter what you'd do.\r\nYomi: Eh?\r\nYume: Cause we all wanna be together with you, Yomi-onee-san.\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYomi: Is that so. ...That seems like it will be difficult to repay you for.\r\nYume: Repay me? If that's how you feel, then play with me a lot!\r\nYomi: ...Play with you?\r\nYume: Yeah! Not just on missions; come with me to the beach and stuff like this!\r\nYume: I like doing things like that more.\r\nYomi: ...Understood. If that's what you wish, then I'll join you, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Great! Then, I guess we should head back now, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san'll get mad wondering where we've been!\r\nYomi: ...Alright then, Tsubakuro-san."}, {"paste_key": "yXavXC4k", "title": "5-5.1 Time Won't Stop", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/yXavXC4k", "timestamp": "", "hits": "128", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "[Due to delays, this chapter will be released in 4 parts.]\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/dqk9ar\r\n1: Where I Belong\r\n\r\nMihono: ...I'm back!\r\nTsugumi: Welcome back, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: Tsugumi-san!

And hey, if you drank it, then buy me a new one!\r\nMirja: That's enough talking about milk. It's time we discussed the issue at hand.\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono. Can you tell us about what happened with Hitakami Makoto?\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: I can.\r\n\r\nMihono: Umm, after all the things they said, my head's honestly a mess right now...\r\nMihono: But, if Hitakami-san's telling the truth, then... there's a great aradama inside me.\r\nEveryone: !?\r\nKiyoka: ...Do you mean that, Hono-chan?\r\nMihono: When Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power was rampaging... That was really all the powers of this great aradama called Kanayamahime.\r\nKiyoka: ...\r\nChie: ...Hey, Mihono-chan?\r\nChie: Why did... Makoto know all this...?\r\nMirja: ...I'm wondering the same.\r\nMirja: In whichever records we looked, there was nothing pertaining to Kashuu Kiyomitsu or the Asakura family.\r\nMirja: Where did Hitakami Makoto find this information?\r\nMihono: It sounds like she's... a distant relative of mine. Hitakami-san's and my family... Apparently, we used to be the Atago family...\r\nMirja: Atago... you say?\r\nMihono: And apparently, five hundred years ago, a miko from the Atago family sealed the great aradama in her own body.\r\nMihono: That great aradama got passed down all this time by the Atago... the Asakura family...\r\nKofuki: So then, why's it waking up now? Wasn't it fine for five hundred years?\r\nMihono: ...\r\nKiyoka: Does it have something to do with the tip of Kashuu Kiyomitsu breaking off...?\r\nMirja: ...It's difficult to say anything in our current situation. We don't have enough information to draw any conclusions.\r\nMirja: At any rate, our immediate next step should be to verify the factuality of what we've learned. Not everything Hitakami Makoto said may necessarily be true.\r\nChie: We'll do something about this, whatever it takes. I promise I'll get you through this, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee...\r\nChie: So please... Don't do anything reckless again. Promise me...\r\nMihono: ...Mm. I promise.\r\nYui: Hey hey, let's leave the serious talk at that and switch over to talking about our sleepover!\r\nMihono: Our sleepover?\r\nKiyoka: That's right!\r\nKiyoka: You've been looking down lately, haven't you, Hono-chan? So we were talking about buying a bunch of snacks and having a sleepover with everyone.\r\nKofuki: Won't have to worry about breaking your wallet either, Mihocchi. Cause Chichie and Mirja are paying, right?\r\nMirja: That was our agreement.\r\nKofuki: See?\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMihono: Fukki... Thanks.\r\nKofuki: For what?\r\nMihono: ...I dunno? But, I felt like I should tell you.\r\nKofuki: Alright then.\r\nTsugumi: Asakura-san, while they prepare for the sleepover, could you come along with me for a bit?\r\nTsugumi: Kanayamahime... I think I could get good data from that.\r\nKofuki: Could you try to read the mood?\r\nTsugumi: To have Shichinosato-san tell me that...\r\nTsugumi: Though, it's captured my interest, so I don't think there's anything I can do about it?\r\nKofuki: Do something about it!\r\nMihono: Ahaha!\r\nMihono: (Good... Everybody's still the same as always. As long as they're here, I know it'll be alright.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/ki9f22\r\n2: Phone Call\r\n\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMirja: ......! This one is the old maid, isn't it!\r\nMihono: Ahh!?\r\nMirja: That finishes it.\r\nMihono: Uwaahhh!? I lost again-!!\r\nKofuki: You suck at this, Mihocchi... And hey, we ran out of drinks.\r\nChie: Now's a good time, so let's take a break.\r\nYui: Ah, then, I'm going to step outside for a minute-.\r\nKofuki: Go buy us something to drink while you're at it-.\r\nYui: Sure thing-.\r\n\r\nYui: ...Phew. Alright, I've gotta make sure to let her know.\r\nHana: ...What is it?\r\nYui: It's been a while, Hana-san. I thought you weren't going to pick up.\r\nHana: It didn't seem like it was ever going stop ringing. ...What did you need?\r\nYui: I didn't need anything, it's more like... I had to tell you something? It's about Mihono-chan.\r\nHana: What about Mihono?\r\nYui: ...Do you know what the Hitakami faction is?\r\nHana: That came out of nowhere... Though, I've heard the name before at least.\r\nYui: Well, it seems like they're getting into experiments like with the Myouga toji project.\r\nHana: Myouga......\r\nHana: What does that have to do with Mihono?\r\nYui: While you haven't been here, there's seriously been so much that's happened...\r\nYui: So much that it'd take too long to get it all out.\r\nHana: ......\r\nYui: ...Hana-san, whatever happens, you'll be there for Mihono-chan, right?\r\nHana: Yui?\r\nYui: I'm sorry... It's just... Whenever things calm down, it's like it all comes over me...\r\nYui: Maybe it's because I heard your voice, I guess.\r\nHana: ...What happened?\r\nYui: Please give me an answer.\r\nHana: ......Of course I will.\r\nYui: There's a great aradama, Kanayamahime, sealed inside of Mihono-chan's body.\r\nHana: !? An evil god... like with Yukari-sama and Hiyori-san...!?\r\nHana: What about Mihono!? Is she alright!?\r\nYui: For now, she's still doing okay. But...\r\nYui: ...Come back to us, Hana-san. We can help Mihono-chan together!\r\nHana: I...\r\nHana: I'm sorry.\r\nYui: Hana-san!\r\nHana: ......Just give me a little longer. I promise... I'll be back.\r\nHana: So just, give me a little more time..."}, {"paste_key": "uiBiQMnB", "title": "Mystery TRPG: The Steam Shrouded Murder Case", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/uiBiQMnB", "timestamp": "", "hits": "450", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/MV1WLV8-IJo\r\n[Another mystery event, there was a contest to guess the killer before the final chapter unlocked.]\r\n\r\n1: Do You Want to Play a Mystery TRPG?\r\n\r\nMaki: With all the help everyone gave, we were able to suppress the aradama on schedule. Thanks again.\r\nEllen: Makimaki, you don't have to be so serious-. We were just doing what we had to do.\r\nYui: That's right; no need to thank us. Rewarding us by letting us all spend the night together has already got me feeling the joy of life!\r\nHiyori: ...I don't really think that's a reward.\r\nEllen: Still, Hiyoyon. We're all staying overnight at a ryokan! Doesn't that get you kinda excited~?\r\nKiyoka: It's not often we get to go on missions overnight with this many people.\r\nKanami: The food we got for dinner too... It was really good, wasn't it-?\r\nSuzuka: Yes, the flavor was exquisite.\r\nKanami: Maybe it's because of that I ate so much, but I'm feeling so tired now...\r\nSuzuka: It's a little early to be going to bed, but there's no need to keep yourself up either. Why not tuck in for the night?\r\nKanami: I guess I will...\r\nKanami: Yawwwn... Anyway, goodnight, everybody-...\r\nMaki: Feel free to spend your time however you want. Though, since Etou is going to bed, please try to keep it down.\r\nEllen: We hardly get chances like this, so I want to play something together with everyone. It'd sort of feel like a waste if we didn't.\r\nYui: The normal thing to do would be to play cards, right? Did anybody bring some?\r\nHiyori: It's not the kind of thing you'd bring along on a mission.\r\nKiyoka: Um, then, how about we play a kind of \"deduction game\"?\r\nHiyori: ...Deduction game?\r\nKiyoka: It's a mystery game where you play as characters who came across a murder case, and we try finding the truth of what happened and who did it.\r\nEllen: Wow! That does sound like fun. Nice idea, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Since there's a fixed number of players, if Shidou-san and Konohana-san would join us too... I'd be glad!\r\nSuzuka: That's fine. We had no plans after this, so we wouldn't mind joining you. Would we, Maki-san?\r\nMaki: Alright. It sounds a little tough, but fun too.\r\nKiyoka: I'll start with a quick introduction. The game we're playing today is \"A Murder Case in a Certain Ryokan\".\r\nKiyoka: Including the victim and the detective/GM character who steers the plot, there are 7 characters in all.\r\nKiyoka: The hostess victim, \"Nekoma Tamaki\". Nekoma's kouhai, \"Toritani Hina\". The new hostess who has only been there for a few months, \"Tatsunami Mizuki\".\r\nKiyoka: The chef who's close friends with Nekoma, \"Torai Rena\". The magazine writer who came looking for material, \"Inokawa Susumu\". The guest staying the night, \"Chidori Takumi\".\r\nKiyoka: And lastly, the detective who is currently working part-time at the ryokan after their partner pointed out their etiquette is lacking, \"Inui Kaguya\".\r\nKiyoka: The last role, the detective, is also played by the GM, so, since I've already played this before, I'll do that one.\r\nKiyoka: We can now decide on who's playing who, and I'll give you these handouts on each one.\r\nKiyoka: The handouts describe what type of character they are, what they were doing the day of the incident, and what your mission is. You can use them as reference while you're playing the character.\r\nKiyoka: So then, about the characters, what do you think? Is there any of them any of you want to play?\r\nEllen: Let's see... We don't know any of the roles or characters all that well, so one idea is to give them out at random.\r\nHiyori: Sounds good. Why don't we go with Ellen's suggestion?\r\nKiyoka: Then, it doesn't sound like anyone is against the idea, so I'll pass around the handouts.\r\n\r\nHiyori: (Torai Rena... So I'm a friend of the murder victim, Nekoma.)\r\nHiyori: (My mission is to hunt down the truth behind Nekoma's death. The game's about searching for the culprit, so that sounds about right.)\r\nKiyoka: I'll give you time to read through the handouts later, so next I'll be explaining how the game progresses.\r\nKiyoka: For deduction... You'll get 40 minutes in total to discuss who you think is the culprit. After 40 minutes have passed, you'll vote on who you think it is, and the one with the most votes is put under arrest.\r\nSuzuka: Am I correct in assuming these handouts you've given us are enough for us to exchange information and identify the culprit?\r\nKiyoka: That's basically right. Though, after every 10 minutes of discussion, as the detective, I'll give everyone \"the brilliant detective's opinion\".\r\nKiyoka: It's okay to think of \"the brilliant detective's opinion\" as an absolute truth. Please treat it like a hint.\r\nSuzuka: I see, so rather than all of us only exchanging information, you'll be speeding up the discussion like that as well.\r\nKiyoka: That's right. After 30 minutes have passed, following the final \"brilliant detective's opinion\", it's okay to try persuading people to agree with your own personal opinion. Does anyone have any questions?\r\nMaki: The mission we get in the handouts is something we have to accomplish besides finding who the murderer is... Am I supposed to think of it like that?\r\nKiyoka: If you try to accomplish it as best you can, I think it'll make things more fun!\r\nEllen: Is it possible someone could tell lies when we're having the discussion?\r\nKiyoka: Yes. The culprit can lie of course, but it's okay for others to lie too to accomplish their missions.\r\nKiyoka: Though, if you tell too many lies, it'll be hard to identify the culprit, so if you could keep that in mind while playing it would help me as the GM.\r\nYui: I have a questiooon~. About getting into our roles, if I'm playing a guy, should I act like that?\r\nKiyoka: You can choose how much you want to get into your roleplaying. You can get deep into the character, or you can act like normal while you work on your missions and search for the culprit. Both work just fine.\r\nHiyori: Just getting into character alone seems like a lot of work.\r\nKiyoka: Also, one last thing to be careful of. You're not allowed to let other people see your handout, or tell them exactly what your mission is.\r\nKiyoka: Now then, please read them over for the next 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: It's been 15 minutes, so I was thinking of starting now, but, is everyone ready?\r\nSuzuka: There shouldn't be any problem with that.\r\nKiyoka: In that case, let's read through the prologue...\r\n\r\nKiyoka: On a small isolated island, this hot springs ryokan stands-- Many visitors come, looking to be healed in the hot springs. However, as it's outside of the tourist season, there are few people here now.\r\n\r\nKanami (Nekoma Tamaki): Come on in. Thanks for stopping by. I'm Nekoma, and I'll be in charge of the room you'll be staying in.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): I'm in your care again, Tamaki-chan! The food here's so good, so I'm looking forward to dinnertime.\r\nKanami (Nekoma Tamaki): Inokawa-san. Are you here looking for material on a hot springs article this time?\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): An article between that and the gourmet food here, something like that-? I got permission to cover it, so I'm counting on your help-!\r\n\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): In this awful weather, I'm glad to see at least a few guests arriving.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): That's for sure. Though, all I can do is show off my skills as a cook.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): By the way, if you keep idling around out here, Tatsunami-san, won't Tamaki give you a scolding?\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): She would. I'll go and help out Nekoma-senpai. You do your best at cooking too, Rena-san-!\r\n\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): Phew... I'm not cut out for physical labor after all... Your luggage... Can I leave it there?\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): ...Sure. That's fine. Will you be the one in charge of my room?\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): Not feeling happy about that? Though, you're right on the mark. I'm only a part-time hostess here, so I've still got a ways to go.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): ......\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): Oh, Toritani-san? You're looking a little out of breath, aren't you?\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): I'm very sorry I was late to welcome you in. My name is Toritani, and I will be in charge of your room here, along with Inui.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): I will do all I can to provide you with a healing experience. If I am insufficient in any way, I would appreciate if you let me know.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): How polite of you. I'll be in your care during my stay.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): By the way, the part-timer girl... Her face is looking awfully pale; is she alright?\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): ...Yeah. Don't pay me any mind. I'm always looking like this.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): Inui-san... Watch how you speak to the guests! (whispered)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: --The staff of the ryokan perform each of their duties, and the guests enjoy this time spent away from their daily lives.\r\nKiyoka: --However, the next day. The open air hot springs, what should be the centerpiece of the ryokan, had been transformed into the scene of a tragedy.\r\n\r\nKanami (Nekoma Tamaki): ......\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): KYAAAA-----!! ...S-Somebody, please come quick! Nekoma-senpai... she's--!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: The hostess, Nekoma Tamaki, was found dead.\r\n\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Tamaki...!\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): Whoa there, Torai-san. You can't go any closer. She's already passed on.\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): And this is a case. Which means preserving the crime scene takes top priority. Get ahold of the panic in your heart, and trust my word... The word of the brilliant detective, Inui Kaguya.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): I thought you just had the same name, but you were the real detective after all. But, more importantly-- Call the police!\r\n\r\n\r\nKiyoka: --But, because of the heavy rain, it was possible it could be days before the police could reach the remote island. Out of fear for themselves, the staff and guests came to the conclusion that they should find the suspect and restrain them.\r\n\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): Sigh... If that's how you all feel, I won't stop you. Just, don't forget you could pin the crime on the wrong person.\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): I'll give my support, but I hope you can find the suspect yourselves. Now, it's time for deduction.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: --\"A Murder Case in a Certain Ryokan\" begins.\r\n\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): For times like these, you should start by asking with the person who first found it, right? Mizuki-san, how'd it look to you?\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): Ah! And I'm a writer who works on magazine articles and stuff. Hope we can get along~.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): When I came to the bathhouse for morning cleaning duty, like I'm in charge of every day, I found Nekoma-san.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): ...I thought it was strange then that the entrance to the bathhouse wasn't locked.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): So that means the entrance is normally locked?\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): But wait, can't you go into the baths at night?\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): Under ordinary circumstances, that's correct.\u3000But, last night, since the forecast said a typhoon was coming close bringing heavy rain, the open air bath should have been locked.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Then, when was it locked up last night?\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): Nekoma-senpai said she would lock it, so I don't know the exact time either...\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): I saw Tamaki-chan in the hallway last night after 9 o'clock, so it had to be after that at least?\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): (Last night... after 9pm? That would be around when Rena was unable to go home due to the heavy rain, and decided to stay at the ryokan.)\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): Did anyone see Nekoma-senpai after that?\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): ...I guess not. I was working the early shift this morning, so I came in early and was relaxing in my room. I don't think I was asleep yet then.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): I couldn't go home because of the rain last night, so I ended up staying here suddenly. I have to restock ingredients and prepare meals early, so I should have already been lying in my futon.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): If only we could estimate her time of death, we could come closer to identifying the culprit... But that seems slightly difficult with the current state of things.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): Changing our perspective, why don't we think about things from the angle of why Nekoma-san was killed?\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): I don't see why not? Though, do you have any idea of why anybody would want to kill her?\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): Are we including that as part of it? I've never even met her before, so I wouldn't know where to start.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): She was a fun and sociable senpai. She'd make sure I knew everything I needed to know for work too.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): Though... She could get a bit on your nerves sometimes.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): That's true. She was a reliable worker, so I can't imagine she wouldn't have locked up...\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): And it was easy to ask her for even the littlest things, since she was so friendly and approachable-.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): You were close with Tamaki-chan, weren't you, Rena-san?\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): How'd you know that?\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): I've made use of this ryokan plenty of times. I'd hear it from Tamaki-chan herself every now and then. How she's real close friends with Rena, the girl cooking the food here.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Oh...\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): The people from the ryokan know already, but I was close with Tamaki. She was my dear friend. That's why I want to find whoever did it, no matter what...\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): She had good friends, and she made sure to do her job. Listening to people's comments on her, it doesn't seem like there'd be any reason for someone to murder her.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): This is where I'd want to determine an \"estimated time of death\", like you see in dramas and in novels.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): So we're back to that, huh... Hmm.\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): Alright, it's been 10 minutes. Here's where I'll offer one of my opinions. It's got to do with the estimated time of death.\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): \"The brilliant detective's 1st opinion\": All I'll say is, somebody here's capable of figuring out the time of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Estimated Time of Death Is?\r\n\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): What do you mean, somebody here can figure out the time of death?\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): She must mean practically speaking. So then, someone here must be a doctor.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Unless the magazine writer is actually a secret doctor, there's only one person it could be.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): That's right... I'm a doctor. I might not be able to give a precise autopsy, but I'll take a look at her.\r\n\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): Judging by the state of rigor mortis, it was likely a murder... The cause of death was excessive blood loss due to blunt trauma to the head.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): It would have been about 7 to 8 hours ago from now.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): It's 7 in the morning now, so the estimated time of death would be roughly \"between 11pm and midnight\" then.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): Yeah. If the police do an examination later on, it shouldn't be too far off from correct.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): Though, I'm not sure what to make of you suddenly revealing somebody's occupation, miss detective. Seems like your partner was right about you.\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): Just something that was necessary in shedding light on the truth.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): I have my own circumstances to deal with though...\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): I understand you have your reasons, but I still want you to explain why you didn't tell us you were a doctor. Estimating the time of death is important enough to warrant it.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): ...I might be a doctor, but I didn't think I would be able to offer anything besides a guess from the stiffness of the body. It wouldn't be accurate enough.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): That's the kind of thing that would benefit the killer though.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): Now now. Regardless, now that we know when the crime was committed, can we proceed with our discussion? We have little time to spare on this.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): Well, you could always prove the doctor's innocence by showing they had some kind of alibi at the time.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): Thanks for that, Hina... san.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): No, I only said what was on my mind. I was resting in my own room during that time period.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): Just to confirm something, you hostesses live and work here, right? Do you share rooms too?\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): All the hostesses here now live here as well. That includes the late Nekoma-san.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): They aren't very spacious, but we do have our own private rooms. Though we shared rooms in the past.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): It's important to have privacy, after all. I lucked out that they did the renovations shortly before I started working here.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): Though, the trouble with it is the sound of doors opening and closing is a little too loud...\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): Yes... You can tell exactly when people in the nearby rooms are coming or going.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): I was resting in my private room at the time. I hadn't gone to sleep yet.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Maybe it was the pillow's fault, but I couldn't get to sleep even though I was lying in bed at the time.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): I think I was also in my room around 11pm, getting ready for bed.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): ...I do remember hearing the sound of a door around that time.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): I was taking a stroll around the ryokan at the time. Taking a few pictures while I was at it.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): Going around taking pictures that late?\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): I was making notes for writing my article, but I wanted something to distract me. And if was going to publish any photos I took, I'd get permission first, of course!\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Since it was so late in the day, it's going to be hard proving everybody's alibis.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): (Though the killer might be lying about theirs...)\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): I'd like to get more information for now, so if anybody has anything they noticed, would you mind sharing it?\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): (Should I reveal some of the information on Torai Rena's handout?)\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): (Unable to sleep, she left her room past 10:40pm to buy something to drink, and saw Mizuki talking to Inokawa...)\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): In that case, there's something I'd like to ask you, Mizuki-san. This isn't restricted to last night, but you and Nekoma-san would sometimes get into fights, wouldn't you?\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): That reminds me, I saw the two of you talking about something at noon yesterday-.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): You looked like you were kind of worried about who could be listening; what was that about?\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): I was only asking Nekoma-senpai something about work, you know?\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): It would be a little embarassing if a guest overheard me...\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): And anyway, Hinahina, what about you? Didn't you get into the hot springs yesterday?\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): As the typhoon was approaching, I did not.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): But you love hot springs so much that it's the reason you started working here. You didn't at least enter the bathhouse to try taking a dip?\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): No. If I had gone, I would have told you all. Even if I may love hot springs, there are times I don't go in them.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Come to think of it, I heard from Tamaki before about how you love hot springs.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): If you work at a ryokan you'd know all about it, wouldn't you-.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): Or actually, if you love hot springs that much, we should all go in together next time! Or we could get in with just the two of us!\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): I don't think now is the time to be saying that...\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): It's been 20 minutes.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): (20 minutes already... It's pretty tough finding a time to bring up information.)\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): Now then, I'll give out a new deduction from my own findings.\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): \"The brilliant detective's 2nd opinion\": The tragedy that happened here might have a lot to do with the bad rumor this ryokan's wrapped up in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: What is the Ryokan's Rumor?\r\n\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): ...The bad rumor this ryokan's wrapped up in?\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Was there something like that?\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): About that... I've heard a little about it myself.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): Could it have something to do with... the furnishings and guest's belongings going missing from the rooms?\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): Does it happen that often?\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): Unfortunately, it's bad enough for it to be mentioned on review sites...\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): Though no one has lost any money or valuables yet, so it doesn't seem like anyone has taken legal action.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): Losing furnishings is one thing, but the manager has said they'll take strict measures if guests are losing their belongings.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): So then, this hasn't just happened once or twice... Bad publicity like this could cause a lot of damage to the ryokan's reputation.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): So that means, the ryokan is suspecting there's a thief?\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): There's probably people thinking that's the case.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): I had no idea...\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): You aren't a hostess after all, Torai-san. Since it isn't directly related to your work, you wouldn't have been informed of it.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Still, how do the cases of missing items connect to Nekoma's murder?\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): From what you've said, the thief didn't steal money or valuables. I can't imagine a person like that would kill someone.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): ...That's true. Were they only stealing things it'd be hard to get punished for taking?\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): The brilliant detective Kiyoka-chan said the stealing is linked to the murder, so either Nekoma Tamaki was the thief, or she found the thief out.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): It's got to be one of those two, right-? Though, drawing conclusions from outside the game like that might be a little unfair.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): Another possibility is that Tamaki-chan was writing complaints on those review sites, though knowing her personality it seems sort of out of character.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): Nekoma-san was a bright and friendly girl, so if she was going to make complaints, I'd think she'd name the culprit herself.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Agreed. She also helped manage the hostesses, so if she'd known who the thief was and reported it to our boss, it's highly likely the problem would have been solved there...\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Which means I think it's one of the earlier two.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): A thief and a murderer... If that's the case, it sounds like you'll have a hard time getting guests to stay here in the future.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): ......\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): If Nekoma was the thief and the victim of this case, then their connection to the killer...\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): No, I guess we don't have enough evidence to decide that for sure.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): (It seems like everybody who worked at the Ryokan besides my character, Torai Rena, knew about the missing items or thefts to some degree...)\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): (Since Yui's character, Inokawa, is a writer for magazines, she'd want to find material that looks like it could be trouble.)\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): (She's acting like this is the first she's heard of it, but it wouldn't be strange if she already knew. Just to be sure, I'll check something...)\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): This is changing the subject a little, but there's something I want to ask you, Inokawa.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): At 10:40 last night, I couldn't sleep, so I went to buy something to drink. Then I saw you talking with Mizuki... What were you two talking about that late?\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): I was just asking Mizuki-chan a little question-. I wanted to know why she became a hostess here.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): It's a bit of a private question, so I declined to answer.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Is there something special about you being a hostess here?\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): Mmm, I guess I don't have a choice...\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): I wanted to keep this a secret, but that might just make me seem strangely suspicious, so I'll tell you all.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): My true name is Tatsuno Mizuki. I'm the granddaughter of the manager here. I was searching from the inside-- to see if the thief was an employee.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): The more I investigated, the more circumstances seemed to point at it being an inside job.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): ...That is unfortunate.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): Then, in that case... Do you have any leads on who the culprit was?\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): I found out--\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): Look at that, it's been 30 minutes. Time to give my final opinion, looks like. Then, let's walk on back to something important.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): (Grh... That's bad timing. Though, Kiyoka... She really seems to be having fun with this.)\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): \"The brilliant detective's 3rd opinion\": Was the bathhouse really left open last night? Or... Did Nekoma lock it at one point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Only 10 Minutes Before We Vote on the Culprit\r\n\r\n\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): Let's walk on back to something important. Was the bathhouse really left open last night? Or... Did Nekoma lock it at one point?\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): Is it that important? Though, I get that it's useful information.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): Let's think a little on whether or not Nekoma-senpai locked the bathhouse.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): Going off the current circumstances, she went to lock the door, but was killed before she could do it.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): The alternative is, she did lock the door at one point, but someone came in after and unlocked it again.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): I see! But, isn't that something we have no way to make sure of?\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): That's not true... Due to the heavy rains, Nekoma-san went to lock the doors last night, but it's ordinarily left open. But then, there would have been one last quick patrol at 10pm.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): The one on patrol duty last night was Inui-san. Since it was her, she must know whether it was locked or not then?\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): That's right. I did the patrol. At that time, at the bathhouse... The door to the baths was locked.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): Hmm... So if the door was locked at 10pm, that means someone would have had to unlock it after that to get in, right?\r\nYui: Actually, Kiyoka-chan, you've gotta tell us something that important sooner-.\r\nKiyoka: I-If nobody was going to confirm that, I had to keep that information to myself...\r\nKiyoka: There's someone with enough information to verify that on their own. Whatever moves I make are up to them.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Though, nobody besides the employees here would take the keys out. Which narrows down the suspects some.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): I wondered a little myself if the cause of death was an accident, but it's looking like that's not the case.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): That's right. Who was it you thought was most likely to be the thief, in the end?\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): Nekoma Tamaki-san. She's the one I suspected of doing it.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): I see... I'm sure she wasn't doing that from the moment she started working here, but... That's a real shame.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): (My mission is to get to the bottom of my friend's death, but she turned out to be a thief...)\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): The person who killed Tamaki-chan, after she was suspected of stealing things...\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): \"I just can't forgive you, Tamaki-chan, for ruining the ryokan's reputation with your stealing...!?\"\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): Somebody could have felt something like that, right? Say, the manager's daughter, Mizuki-chan.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): If I were the one who committed the murder, I'd have really mixed my priorities up. That would end up being even more scandalous.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): And it doesn't look like we have time to look into every one of the victim's personal relationships for clues.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Which means, we're proving our alibis based on the estimated time of death?\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Though, we couldn't prove everyone's when we checked earlier.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): And to start with, I think it'd be difficult for anyone who's not a member of the staff to unlock the door and commit the crime.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): That puts me in trouble. I can't prove my alibi, and it's possible I took the key to the bathhouse.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): The same goes... for me.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): Though, Torai-san is a chef of this ryokan as well. It's not as if she couldn't have taken the key, is it?\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): It's a little more plausible than one of the guests doing it. Though, I don't have any reason to have killed her.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): What if it's all the more reason because you two were close that you couldn't forgive her? Well, there's plenty of reasons we could come up with.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): About the alibis... Last night, \"from 11pm to midnight\", I was in my room. And Toritani Hina-san was with me.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): Because, she's... my lover.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): ......\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): You didn't need to tell them that here...\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): Ehh-!?\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): Then, why didn't you say something before? You could've proved your alibis right away.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): Not doing that feels suspicious.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): That's because...\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): I'll explain to them why.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): If you all had known my lover was visiting, I assumed you would poke fun at us, so I simply wanted to leave it unsaid.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): And... Nekoma-san did love to gossip, didn't she? I thought she would pry too much into it...\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): ...It feels like it could be annoying to deal with.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): I only didn't say something before because Hina stopped me before I came to visit.\r\nMaki (Chidori Takumi): Still, now that things have come to this, I don't think it should matter more than proving our innocence.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): I'm sorry. After what happened here, I... I found it too hard to say to say I had slipped out in the night to meet with my lover.\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): It's right about... time to make a decision. Was there anybody you found suspicious?\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): There's not much time left. If anybody wants to offer up their opinion, you'd better do it now.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): I think Mizuki-san's still a little suspicious after all.\r\nYui (Inokawa Susumu): She could have revealed herself as the manager's granddaughter to the victim, and blamed them for the stealing.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): Oh... I didn't think, by trying so hard to find the culprit, I'd end up being suspected instead.\r\nEllen (Tatsunami Mizuki): I'm not sure about the culprit's motives, but I still think there's someone more suspicious than me here.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): If it was someone on close terms with the vicim, they could have called her out alone and taken her by surprise when they killed her.\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): (Should I say something too...? No, I should be using this time to think carefully over everything.)\r\nHiyori (Torai Rena): (I'll put everything we've learned together and fill in the name of the suspect.)\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): Write down the name of who you think did it on the paper. Then we can check over them later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: The One Who Committed this Crime is...!\r\n\r\nKiyoka (Inui Kaguya): It looks like everyone's votes match up with my deduction.\r\nKiyoka: --As a result of the voting, Toritani Hina will be restrained and put under arrest.\r\nKiyoka: From here, I'll narrate to you the ending. Please bear with me for just a little longer.\r\nKiyoka: It would help me too if you'd say a few things about why you did it too, Konohana-san.\r\nSuzuka: Yes, I understand.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Not long after Toritani Hina was taken into custody, the sky became so clear you wouldn't imagine a typhoon had just come through. While waiting for the police to arrive, Toritani Hina began to speak about why she did it.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): As you're all already aware, Nekoma-san had a habit of stealing. It wasn't that she wanted money, she simply enjoyed the act of stealing itself.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): I had unknowingly cooperated with her previously, in the form of keeping watch for her. Afterwards, Nekoma-san and I had a complicated relationship, though I wouldn't say it was antagonistic.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): Last night, at around 11pm, since it seemed we had entered the eye of the storm and it wasn't raining, I did indeed go into the hot springs.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): Nekoma-san still had the key, so when I told her I would come get it, she replied that she would meet me there.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): I was going to do some cleaning of the rain battered open air bath, when she told me this. She was going to have some fun in the room of the guest who had arrived today-- steal from them, and she wanted my help.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): Of course I refused, and told her that it would be better if she admitted to what she had been doing all this time. Then she grabbed me in anger, calling me \"her accomplice.\"\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): There was a struggle, and I threw her away from me. I had no desire to help such a self-centered girl.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): Halfway through, the rain had once again come pouring down, and I was unable to find the key to the door to the springs.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): The last thing I remember thinking was that I wasn't able to enter the bath.\r\nKiyoka: The sound of a car approaches. Several police officers arrive.\r\nSuzuka (Toritani Hina): I wish that, just one more time... I could have enjoyed the famous hot springs here.\r\nKiyoka: That concludes \"A Murder Case in a Certain Ryokan\". Good work, everyone-!\r\n\r\nYui: That was a ton of fun-! Though, I was half counting on luck for my vote.\r\nKiyoka: I had trouble figuring it out too, the time that I played.\r\nEllen: I wanted to do things a little better, but it sure was hard finding timing to put out the info I had-.\r\nEllen: Makimaki's confession at the end that \"they were lovers\" is what made my mind up.\r\nMaki: I wasn't sure about doing that either. My mission was to \"not allow your lover, Hina, to be arrested\".\r\nMaki: Since Suzuka, who was playing my lover, was starting to look suspicious, I thought I'd better give her an alibi, but I guess it backfired.\r\nSuzuka: It was certainly a bit sudden. If you had told that lie when we had first given out alibis, it might have been effective.\r\nHiyori: There was a lot of info leaning that way, like how Toritani Hina loved hot springs, so it seemed like it'd be easy for her to get votes.\r\nSuzuka: I had a very hard time finding someone else to pin the blame on... Those brilliant detective's opinions giving away the truth made it troublesome.\r\nKiyoka: I know. It's hard playing the role of the culprit.\r\nYui: Hey hey, Kiyoka-chan! I want to ask something! My mission was to \"find out why Mizuki was hiding her identity without revealing it,\" but, did I do that?\r\nKiyoka: Inokawa Susumu already knew about Mizuki's true identity from the start, and since you learned what her goal was without bringing it up yourself, you cleared your mission, Yui-chan.\r\nEllen: My mission was to \"eliminate the cause of the ryokan's bad reputation (by having the death treated as an accident)\", but... Isn't that impossible to do? This ryokan has criminals all over.\r\nKiyoka: Apparently if everyone only has one vote, it's treated as an accidental death and the mission is cleared.\r\nKiyoka: If that happens, the detective also sort of stops pursuing the truth. It kind of feels more like a game that way.\r\nEllen: I have a hard time accepting that, but... It was fun, so that's OK!\r\nHiyori: Looking back, Nekoma was such an awful person that, even though I cleared my mission to \"get to the bottom of my friend's death\", it doesn't feel very refreshing. Though it was fun.\r\nSuzuka: Toritani Hina as well... She was a bit of a difficult person.\r\nYui: Though, I'd like to get along with a girl that loves hot springs, myself.\r\nKanami: Yawwn... I'm up-. What are you all doing?\r\nHiyori: We were playing a game where you find the culprit of a murder case.\r\nKanami: What the heck; that sounds so fun!

And, we were looking for play testers.\r\nKanami: A new game!? That sounds fun! Don't you want to try it, Sayaka-chan?\r\nSayaka: ...\r\nKanami: Sayaka-chan? What's wrong? You don't look too happy.\r\nSayaka: Tsugumi made that, didn't she... Kofuki said, \"Watch out with stuff she's made\"...

But you don't need to worry, Kitora-san is working with me this time.\r\nTsugumi: And we've proven it to be perfectly safe.

Does that mean you can do things like fly around and make friends with the locals?\r\nTsugumi: That's right. We've put quite a lot of effort into the details on that end, so please look forward to it.\r\nTsugumi: If you befriend the townspeople, they can provide you with food and sweets, and invite you to parties... We've included fun features like that.\r\nKanami: Sounds fun! Sayaka-chan, I want to try it out!\r\nSayaka: Mm... But, I'm fine with sweets in the real world...\r\nTsugumi: Is that right.

But actually, I'd like to discuss something with you.\r\nMaki: Discuss what?\r\nSuzuka: It's about the birthday present we bought for Yomi-san the other day.\r\nMaki: Oh yeah. We picked out a great present thanks to you. I'm looking forward to surprising her with it. But, what about it?\r\nSuzuka: You see, I had hidden it in the back of the record room so that Yomi-san wouldn't find it until the 24th...\r\nMaki: Don't tell me she found it!?\r\nSuzuka: No, I was able to retrieve it just in time, but Yomi-san' intuition is sharp. I'm not quite sure how to keep it a secret until the day of.\r\nMaki: I get it. You're right, that's an important discussion to have.\r\nSuzuka: To begin with, anywhere we can enter, Yomi-san freely enters as well...\r\nMaki: And if we kept it in our living quarters, Yume would likely find it whenever she comes in to play around.\r\nSuzuka: In previous years, we prepared it together with Yume, so the three of us could have kept it a secret between us.\r\nMaki: But she went and said she'd do something on her own this year. I want to keep it secret from Yume too if possible...\r\nYomi: Konohana-san, you were in here?\r\nSuzuka: Y-Yomi-san! Hadn't you gone off on an assignment?\r\nYomi: I was called in by Yukari-sama. I'm supposed to bring you with me as well.\r\nSuzuka: Yukari-sama asked for you and myself? Very well then. We can leave in a moment. Though...\r\nMaki: I'll take care of the present for now. If you think of a good place to store it, send me a message.\r\nSuzuka: Alright then. Do your best to keep it a secret.\r\n\r\nYukari: Konohana, Satsuki, the two of you will be undertaking a special mission.\r\nSuzuka: I understand. Ask us to do whatever is needed.\r\nYomi: Yes, whatever the mission entails, we will carry it out flawlessly.\r\nYukari: Those are encouraging responses.

Yukari-sama, thank you for offering us this lovely mission.\r\nYomi: So long as you order it, I'll tend to it quickly, Yukari-sama.\r\nYukari: The presents have already been set aside in the storehouse. I leave it to you to decide how to distribute them. Is that clear?\r\nSuzuka: Yes ma'am!\r\n\r\nYomi: There's a mountain of presents...\r\nSuzuka: Would you look at that! Each of them is so neatly wrapped; just the sight of it gives me a thrill!\r\nYomi: Does it...\r\nSuzuka: They're all so cute, and yet you don't seem interested in the slightest, Yomi-san...\r\nSuzuka: Ahh!

Here I go.\r\nSuzuka: If any of our little friends would like a present, please line up in front of us onee-sans~!\r\nChildren: Okaaay!\r\nYomi: I see, bring yourself down to their level, and speak plainly to them... I'll try it.\r\nYomi: Everyone, if you want a present, please line up. Will everyone who wants a present please line up.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: All the presents were peacefully handed out. You did well, Yomi-san.\r\nYomi: ......\r\nSuzuka: Are you feeling too tired to have much to say? Though, because of your efforts today, you brought happiness to plenty of children.\r\nYomi: Do you think so?\r\nSuzuka: I do. And that Santa bag you're holding is the proof of it. Isn't the inside filled with objects of their gratitude?\r\nYomi: Yes; letters, drawings, candies, and chocolate. I never expected them to give me so many gifts in return.\r\nSuzuka: With this, we should be able to give a good report to Yukari-sama.\r\nYomi: That's true.\r\nYomi: By the way, Konohana-san. You've been carefully holding onto one present for a while now. Did you forget to distribute it?\r\nYomi: Our mission today was to deliver every last one of the presents. We should hurry and find a child to deliver it to.\r\nSuzuka: There won't be any need for that. This here is Maki-san and my birthday present to you, Yomi-san.\r\nYomi: For... me?\r\nSuzuka: With all the confusion surrounding the party and our missions, we ended up a day late, but Yomi-san, we wish you a happy birthday.\r\nYomi: Konohana-san...\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, and I'll take a photo of the moment of our successful surprise. Maki-san on her expedition assignment should be glad to see this.\r\nYomi: Thank you for your gift. I'm grateful for your thoughtfulness.\r\nSuzuka: You're very perceptive, Yomi-san, so we were anxious you might find your present before we could give it to you.\r\nSuzuka: We were very lucky to keep it a secret until today. I suppose you hide a tree in a forest, and a present among gifts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/6wrqf7\r\n[Dress 20 - Akira: Start]: No Way I'd Be Late\r\n\r\nYomi: Akira.\r\nAkira: Nn?

What's that supposed to mean?\r\nSawano: No, nothing at all.\r\nSawano: At any rate, I'm glad you're here. Who'd have thought...\r\nSawano: Such a large aradama outbreak would happen.\r\nAkira: Tch. And just when I was thinking I'd made it to school on time for once!\r\nAkira: Oi, you mind if I just do my own thing here? I've got somewhere to be after this!\r\nSawano: Ordinarily I'd say we can't manage, but... Fine. We'll do what we can to support you.\r\nAkira: Sorry. I'll pay you back for this soon enough.\r\nSawano: Please deal with the aradama. That would be plenty.\r\nAkira: Count on me!\r\n\r\nAkira: That's finally over with!\r\nAkira: But, look how late it got... There's no way I'm making it on time.\r\nAkira: What's Yomi gonna say...\r\nSawano: Thank you very much for today, Inago-san.\r\nSawano: Especially for helping us on the day of the Miss Five Traditions recognition party.\r\nAkira: There's no getting out of it when it's my mission.

I mean, I went to school like normal too!\r\nAkira: But then I got sent on this mission all of a sudden, and up till now I was way out in the mountains suppressing aradama!\r\nYomi: That sounds like something you would do.

I'm in your care.\r\n\r\nEllen: First off, let's check what level you're at right now! Try moving together with me as if we're being attacked by enemies from all sides.\r\nMihono: Got it! Then, let's get right to it...\r\nMihono: TAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nEllen: Wow! Mihomiho, if you push out on your own like that, there's nothing for me to coordinate with!\r\nMihono: Ah-- that's right. Right after I asked you to come give me special training on that too. Sorry... I really can't do anything right.\r\nEllen: Please don't look so down in the dumps.

This is the perfect chance to test how well we can coordinate with each other!\r\nMihono: Oh yeah, you're right! I'm gonna give it my all then!\r\nEllen: Alright, match up with me, and let's go!\r\n\r\nEllen: Mihomiho, you did good work back there. We managed to clear them out together.\r\nMihono: [Pant... pant...] Ellen-san, I'm sorry. I couldn't move around all that great at all...\r\nMihono: I bet that, if you were fighting with Kaoru-san, this would have been nothing for you...\r\nEllen: It's nothing for you to feel depressed over. You must be tired after fighting so much, so why don't we end today's lesson here?\r\nMihono: Okay. Thanks a lot for helping me today. I'm going to do a little more training on my own.\r\nEllen: It's not a good idea to push your body too hard when you're already tired.\r\nMihono: Still, if I can improve a little, I want to try! I have to think over the parts I messed up today before I forget them...\r\nEllen: I think that's important too, but... Mihomiho, can you come out with me for a while? There's someplace I want to take you.\r\nMihono: But...\r\nEllen: We'll change up the location and keep our lesson going. Come on!\r\n\r\nEllen: This is my treat today, so let's enjoy some delicious sweets together!\r\nMihono: Eh... Why sweets? ...Oh, I get it.\r\nMihono: You're really nice, Ellen-san. You made that up about the lesson so you could bring me here.\r\nMihono:  But I still want to get even stronger. If I have the time to be having fun, I'd rather be training...\r\nEllen: You've got it all wrong, Mihomiho. I brought you here to show you the secret to coordination.\r\nMihono: The secret to coordination's in a cake shop!? How's that work?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Secret to Coordination!?\r\n\r\nEllen: They're going to start serving us all kinds of drinks and sweets, Mihomiho. I want you to enjoy them exactly how I tell you, okay?\r\nMihono: Okay...\r\nEllen: First off, while you drink a cup of this black tea, try eating some of this orange tart.\r\nMihono: Whoa! That's yummy~! I can't put my fork down.\r\nEllen: Next, savor this espresso together with this bitter chocolate.\r\nMihono: Ohm ohm. Wow-! This has more of an adult flavor. It's really tasty!\r\nEllen: And, lastly, this bitter matcha tea with this set of Japanese sweets.\r\nMihono: Mmm~! This's delicious too! Ahh~, when you eat something yummy, it just feels like all the bad stuff goes flying away.\r\nEllen: I finally got you to smile. It was worth bringing you here after all!\r\nMihono: Thanks for bringing me. But, Ellen-san, what does this have to do with the secret to coordination?\r\nEllen: The secret is, all of the sweets you had today were a marriage of deliciousness!\r\nMihono: Marriage? What do you mean?\r\nEllen: In French, it is the word for \"being married\", but it also means \"to have a match of the highest compatibility.\"\r\nMihono: The highest compatibility...\r\nEllen: When you understand each other's traits verrry well, and combine them the best way possible, 1+1 can be 10 or 100...\r\nEllen: Doesn't you think that's similar to the lessons we're doing on coordinating?\r\nMihono: Now that you mention it, that sounds just like how you and Kaoru-san fit together.\r\nEllen: That's right. Kaoru is usually in energy conservation mode, so she might come across as a bit unreliable when we're fighting. But, that just means she has plenty of effort to spare when it really counts.\r\nEllen: I know that by heart, so, when Kaoru is with me, I feel safe jumping into even the most dangerous situations.\r\nMihono: So that's how it is...\r\nEllen: Of course, it is important to polish your skills with plenty of training on your own. But, I think that the secret to coordination is to learn lots about your fighting partner and come to trust each other.\r\nMihono: Learn lots about your partner, and trust each other... I've been so focused on myself that I haven't felt free to think about other people at all...\r\nMihono: But, like that, there's no way I'd be able to get good coordination with anybody else.\r\nEllen: Cheer up, Mihomiho. If there's something you can't do, just try phrasing it a different way, and then you'll see what you can do about it! If you can improve on that, I'm sure you'll get a lot stronger!\r\nMihono: Ellen-san... You're right; where there's a will, there's a way! I'll give it my best shot!\r\nEllen: I like that response! In that case, how about we have our next lesson a week from now?\r\nMihono: Sure! Okaaay, I'll work hard at my own secret special training for next week!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Mihono's Secret Special Training\r\n\r\nMihono: What's important is to know your partners well and trust them. So that means, I'll have to watch them extra close, right!\r\nMihono: I'll start off by doing some in depth investigating on the people I spend the most time fighting with: everybody from the investigation team!\r\nMihono: To see the sides of them that they usually wouldn't show, I have to be extra sneaky, so they won't notice...\r\nKofuki: Oi, Mihocchi! What're you sneaking around for!\r\nMihono: Wah!? She found me out right away.\r\nKofuki: What were you up to?\r\nMihono: Sorry, sorry... I wasn't doing anything. Anyway, later-!\r\n\r\nMihono: Sigh. It's pretty tough, watching somebody without them finding out. Ah, that's Yui over there!\r\nMihono: (This time for sure, I'll follow her around all sneaky so she won't see...)\r\n\r\nMihono: (Alright, I've been following her for a pretty long time and she hasn't suspected a thing. That should be enough info on Yui. Next is...)\r\nYui: Ehh, Mihono-chan, are you done already? You can follow me around some more, you know-.\r\nMihono: Yui! You found out!? Since when?\r\nYui: I knew the whooole time, from the very start. There's no way I wouldn't know when a girl has her eyes on me.\r\nMihono: Ughh... I shouldn't be surprised when it comes to Yui. But, still, that's important info too. I'll write it down. \"Sensitive to signs of girls\"...\r\n\r\nOne week later.\r\n\r\nMihono: Phew, it was really tough, but I somehow finished my secret special training in time! I hope I get to show off the progress I made today~.\r\nMihono: Wait, why are aradama showing up now!? And there's so many of them...\r\nMihono: No, now's not the time to lose my nerve! Where there's a will, there's a way!\r\nMihono: YAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: HAAH!\r\nMihono: No way-!? I'm surrounded...!\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOO!\r\nMihono: !!!\r\nEllen: I'll protect you, Mihomiho! YAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nMihono: E-Ellen-san!? Thanks a lot. You saved me.\r\nEllen: You don't have to thank me. Come on, let's take down the rest of the aradama together!\r\nMihono: We're coordinating, aren't we! I'm glad I'll get to show off the results of my special training right away!\r\nEllen: That sounds promising! Let's show them our best together!\r\nMihono: Yeah! Here goes! TAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!\r\nEllen: Mihomiho, leave that one to me! YAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!\r\nMihono: Okay! Ellen-san, let's finish it together!\r\nMihono/Ellen: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!\r\nMihono: ...We beat all of them! Ellen-san! We worked together great, didn't we!!\r\nEllen: We did! What kind of training did you do, to get to such excellent coordination in just one week!?\r\nMihono: ...I did this! Please check over what I learned from a whole week of secret training!\r\nEllen: Hmhm, what's this notepad for?\r\nMihono: You're the one who told me the secret to coordinating was learning lots about your partner, so,\r\nMihono: I watched everybody and kept a journal of the things they did.\r\nEllen: Fukki, Yuiyui, Chie, Mirja, Kiyoka... Fufu, you must have spent the whole week watching everyone from the investigation team.\r\nMihono: Not just the investigation team; take a look at this notepad too!\r\nEllen: Wow! This whole notepad is just about me? You did an impressive job stalking!\r\nMihono: Eheheh. I really wanted to get good coordination with you here, Ellen-san, so I tried my best.\r\nEllen: Mihomiho...

I told you to keep that a secret...\r\nKaoru: There's no point hiding it. This last week, Ellen was worried about you too, so she was secretly watching over you.\r\nMihono: You were!? Then that means, we were both watching each other...\r\nEllen: This is kind of, a little embarrassing now.\r\nKaoru: Look at that, you two're head over heels.\r\nMihono: Oh yeah! I want to coordinate better with Kaoru-san next, so can I watch you too?\r\nKaoru: No way!\r\nMihono: What's wrong with that? I'll do it all sneaky; you won't even notice!\r\nKaoru: Cut it out-.\r\nEllen: If you keep getting along this well, it shouldn't take long at all for you to have some good coordination going."}, {"paste_key": "Vmu4jT0v", "title": "revue mai/mahouka mirja episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/Vmu4jT0v", "timestamp": "", "hits": "43", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://mega.nz/file/9IJiFQwa#fyo_xuN0A3K8HX4Lcphtl-KMabHlB-PBMnLAWGmX0X8\r\n[Stage Girl - Mai: Start]: Two Triangles\r\n\r\nKanami: I can't wait to spar with all these stage girls! If I pass this up, I'll never get another chance like it.\r\nKanami: Honestly, ever since we came here and I saw them fighting aradama, I've wanted to spar with them-.\r\nMai: You said the same thing back when you first saw Hiyori-chan at the tournament, didn't you, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: Ehehe.\r\nHiyori: You did? Though it sounds just like something you'd do.\r\nKanami: Ah, Hiyori-chan. What's up?\r\nHiyori: What do you mean, \"What's up?\" You're the one who said to meet here so we could spar now.\r\nKanami: Oh yeah! Then, let's get right to it! I'll catch up with you later, Mai-chan~.\r\nMai: Okay. Be sure not to get hurt, you two.\r\nMai: ......\r\nMahiru: Mai-chan?\r\nMai: Tsuyuzaki-san? Did you need something?\r\nMahiru: Nothing in particular, but, I was watching you with Kanami-chan. You seem close.\r\nMai: We sure are. As soon as we met in middle school, we were fast friends. We spend lots of time together, in classes and in the dorms.\r\nMahiru: Just like Karen-chan and I. Since the start of high school, we've always been together as roommates! Though now there's three of us, since Hikari-chan moved in.\r\nMahiru: What about Hiyori-chan? Her uniform is different, so she's from a different school, isn't she?\r\nMai: We got to know Hiyori-chan during an incident at the tournament in our second year, and we've been friends ever since.\r\nMai: It all started with Kanami-chan befriending Hiyori-chan.\r\nMahiru: So that's what happened.\r\nKanami: Mai-chaaan, Tsuyuzaki-saaan! There's some aradama, so come over here!\r\nMai: We should go.\r\nMahiru: Okay!\r\n\r\nAradama: GGGIIII!\r\nMai: Tsuyuzaki-san, one of the aradama went that way! Could you get it!\r\nAradama: GGIIIII!\r\nMahiru: It's a little... scary, but I'll do it!\r\nMahiru: EIIIIIII!!\r\nMahiru: There! Home run!\r\nMahiru: It looks like we just finished cleaning up the aradama too.\r\nMai: The aradama's really gone... You're incredible, Mahiru-san.\r\nMahiru: It sort of looked like a ball, so I just gave it a good whack on reflex.\r\nMai: That was only by reflex...?\r\nMai: And not just that, but how you casually twirled around that weapon of yours like a baton as you fought...\r\nMai: The way you moved... I think I could use it as reference in future fights.\r\nMahiru: It's sort of embarrassing hearing you talk like that, Mai-chan.\r\nMahiru: But, would it really be helpful learning from me?\r\nMai: I'd like to give it a try. Will you teach me how?\r\nMahiru: Mmm, but even if I teach you how to twirl a baton, it's not very useful for fighting, is it? I just somehow make it work...\r\nMahiru: I know! Mai-chan, could we try training like we're really fighting?\r\nMai: Of course, if that's alright with you.\r\nMahiru: Then, let's do it over there.\r\n\r\nMahiru: I love the shining stage, but I love seeing you shine even more. I want to dance with you forever, in a duet going round and round. 99th generation, Tsuyuzaki Mahiru.\r\nMai: That line just now had such a stylish ring to it.\r\nMahiru: Ehehe, thank you. It makes me happy, hearing you say that. I get the feeling we're sort of alike, Mai-chan.\r\nMai: We're alike?\r\nMahiru: But we can talk about that after!\r\nMahiru: Fighting might be more of your specialty, but come try me, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: Here I come!\r\nMahiru: Ah, but I would appreciate it if you'd go a little easy on me after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://mega.nz/file/lNQ1zYzR#aLAw1bVW8AeuquMf6OidutCAUkSJcGy2apIy0d4vQZY\r\n[Stage Girl - Mai: End]: I Love Seeing You Shine Even More\r\n\r\nMahiru: Phew... I worked up a good sweat.\r\nMahiru: How was that? I hope it was helpful getting to see it up close at least.\r\nMai: It was. Though, I don't know if I'll be able to put it into practice straight away.\r\nMahiru: It would be difficult to use your okatana the same way I use my weapon, wouldn't it.\r\nMai: I think it's incredible enough that you can use that weapon like a baton, Tsuyuzaki-san!\r\nMahiru: You keep flattering me so much, Mai-chan~.\r\nMai: Ah, by the way. Before we started training, you told me the two of us were alike?\r\nMahiru: Yeah, about that. I sort of had the feeling that the relationship between you, Kanami-chan, and Hiyori-chan was similar to us.\r\nMahiru: I told you earlier, but, I'm roommates with Karen-chan, and I love her and we've always been together.\r\nMahiru: But then... When we were in our second year of high school, Hikari-chan, Karen-chan's childhood friend, transferred in.\r\nMai: Now that you say that, it does feel a little alike.\r\nMahiru: At the time... I felt like Hikari-chan was stealing Karen-chan away from me... I felt really anxious for a while...\r\nMahiru: That's why, I know I'm being a busybody, but I was kind of worried about how things are for you.\r\nMai: Thank you for your concern. Though, I'm fine. Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan are both close friends of mine.\r\nMahiru: I'm glad to hear it. Sorry, for asking you something so weird.\r\nMai: Not at all.\r\nMahiru: Ahh, even though I'm the older one here, I'm acting kind of presumptuous. You really feel more reliable, Mai-chan.\r\nMai: That's not true; I'm still working on that myself.\r\nMai: Since we came to this world, you've worried about the troubles we're having more times than I can remember.\r\nMai: You're like our reliable big sister.\r\nMahiru: Well, I am a big sister. I have a little sister and brother at home. Maybe it's because of them, but I always find myself wanting to help others.\r\nMai: Ah, I have two little sisters myself.\r\nMahiru: We're the same~.\r\nMahiru: I don't mind going out of my way to help people, or I guess I should say, I just feel like I need to do something.\r\nMahiru: I used to help even more with Karen-chan in the past. Like helping her get out of bed in the mornings.\r\nMai: I can't help myself from taking care of things for my friends either. Though, sometimes they say I'm being overprotective...\r\nMahiru: Hmmm, but, if the person you're helping isn't bothered by it, isn't it alright?\r\nMai: That's how I feel!\r\nKanami: Good work, you two-.\r\nKaren: Mahiru-chan, you sorta look like you're getting along with Mai-chan. What were you talking about?\r\nMahiru: About how we tend to look after others, and how we're a little bit a like.\r\nHiyori: Now that you mention it, you might be similar to each other.\r\nHikari: But when it comes to looking after others, I think you overdo it some.\r\nMahiru: If you could keep everything in order yourself, Hikari-chan, I wouldn't argue. Can you?\r\nHikari: Nn...\r\nKaren: I want you to help with that, Mahiru-chan. Without you around, our room would look like a disaster zone.\r\nMahiru: You and Hikari-chan should make sure to tidy up after yourselves, Karen-chan~.\r\nKanami: Hey, Mai-chan. I've got something I want to ask from you.\r\nMai: Like what? I'm all ears.\r\nKanami: I was eating the sweets Daiba-san made earlier. And I started wanting to have some of your cookies.\r\nKanami: When we get back, could you make some for me...?\r\nMai: Mm, I'll make you some.\r\nKanami: Nice-, thanks-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://mega.nz/file/NM4zwCSI#e4j4XEndiYI-su2D4RvkAVQQEo9R8QnWAYoP7N47CGo\r\n[Mahouka - Mirja: Start]: Mirja and Mayumi\r\n\r\nMirja: ...I see, so that's what kind of magic you have, Saegusa Mayumi.\r\nMayumi: That's it. At the Nine Schools Competition, I finished with a perfect bullseye. With a \"bang!\"\r\nMirja: Going back, what is this Nine Schools Competition?\r\nMayumi: Ah, that's right, you wouldn't have a Nine Schools Competition here.\r\nMayumi: If I say it's... a competitive magic tournament, does that make it easy to picture?\r\nMirja: Yes, that's easily understandable.\r\nMirja: Hm... With that magic, you would be highly beneficial when fighting against aradama...\r\nMayumi: Anyway, putting that aside, are you feeling peckish? It's about lunchtime, isn't it?\r\nMirja: You're right, now would be a good time for it.\r\n\r\nMirja: Oh, that's... Asakura Mihono with Shiba Miyuki.\r\nMayumi: They seem to be enjoying themselves quite a lot, though, I wonder what they're talking about?\r\nMayumi: Let's go see, Kitora-san.\r\n\r\nMirja: You look like you're having a good time, Asakura Mihono.\r\nMihono: Ah, Mirja-san, Mayumi-san!\r\nMayumi: What were you talking about with Asakura-san, Miyuki-san?\r\nMiyuki: I was just speaking a little about Onii-sama.\r\nMayumi: About Tatsuya-kun?\r\nAcademy Announcement: An appearance of aradama has been confirmed. Please prepare to sortie at once. I repeat--\r\nMirja: Aradama!\r\nMayumi: We'll lend a hand. Won't we, Miyuki-san?\r\nMiyuki: Yes, of course.\r\nMirja: ...That would be helpful.\r\nMirja: In that case, Shiba Miyuki, I leave you with Asakura Mihono. Saegusa Mayumi will be with me.\r\nMihono/Miyuki: Right.\r\nMayumi: Will pairing off like this be alright?\r\nMirja: While magic may not be able to exorcise aradama, Shiba Miyuki's magic is effective against them.\r\nMirja: Paired with Asakura Mihono, she should be able to cover for her, just in case.\r\nMayumi: You really are considerate of your kouhai, aren't you, Kitora-san. I had pictured you as someone more logically driven.\r\nMirja: Logically driven...? It's true that Asakura Mihono is a valuable member of our investigation team.\r\nMirja: Though, Saegusa Mayumi. If I had left Asakura Mihono with you, I don't believe you would let anything go wrong either.\r\nMayumi: I'm honored to hear it.

Miyuki-san was really incredible!\r\nMirja: We can speak about that more later.

Though, you were excellent yourself, Saegusa Mayumi.\r\nMirja: I didn't think that, just by having long range support, it would make such a dramatic difference in efficiency...\r\nMayumi: Would you try recreating it after you wake up from this dream?\r\nMirja: That would be difficult to accomplish. Multi-Scope and Magic Bullet Shooter.\r\nMirja: I believe this was only possible because of how skilled you are at manipulating the both of them.\r\nMayumi: Thank you for the compliments, Kitora-san.\r\nMirja: I meant it. That aside, the aradama interrupted us when we were about to have lunch just now.\r\nMayumi: They did; I'm famished at this point. Even though it's a dream.

But, I'll try it.\r\nMai: You'll be fine. I'll be there with you, and I know you can do it.\r\nMai: And then, we also talked about using a big iron plate and making enough yakisoba for everyone.\r\nMai: So long as we bring noodles, we can make it with the ingredients from the barbecue.\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nSayaka: ...From talking about food, I started feeling a little hungry.\r\nMai: I know what you mean.

How was the meat you cooked yourself?\r\nSayaka: It was tasty. But, I wasn't sure how much to grill it at first, so I burnt some.\r\nMai: I know what you mean. There were times I burned things when I first started cooking. I was worried I might undercook it.\r\nSayaka: You did it too, Mai? I want to try doing this again. With Kaoru next time.\r\nMai: It would be nice to come again when Kaoru is free.\r\nMai: Now that we've eaten, why don't we take a short break and then go to the river?\r\nMai: It seems like there's places where the river hardly flows at all, and you can just leisurely float along.\r\nSayaka: That sounds like Kaoru would like it.\r\nMai: That's true. If Kaoru-chan were here, I could see her relaxing with Nene-chan.\r\nSayaka: Tubing on the river.

This is only from a nosebleed I got.\r\nAkira: That's a nosebleed...? Ugh, and now I've got your nosebleed on me...!\r\nYui: Ehehe. Sorry about that, Boss. If you take your clothes off for me, I'll wash them and give them back to you.\r\nAkira: ...I'll wash 'em myself.\r\nMai: More importantly... Why were you inside that locker?\r\nYui: See, I hid in there so I could peep on girls while they were changing, but it got way too hot and I got all dizzy. Ahaha.\r\nMai: Err...\r\nMirja: Seeing you come out of the locker, I assumed it was something like that...\r\nYui: That's my Mirja-san! We know each other inside and out!\r\nMirja: Sigh...

The water is pretty warm at this point, but, if you drink some, you'll feel better.\r\nMai: We don't have that much left, though you shouldn't push yourselves too hard, so don't hold back if you need it.\r\nKanami: Okay. And also, Mai-chan, could I have some cookies too?\r\nMai: ...I think your throat would feel dry after eating them, but, so long as you don't mind that.\r\nKanami: I'm really starving now.\r\nKanami: Mmm, every time I have them, Mai-chan's cookies are just too good!\r\nYui: Give me some too! I want Mai-chan's handmade cookies!\r\nYui: Ahhh... This is the taste of Mai-chan.\r\nKanami: Mm... Now my mouth's all dried out...\r\nMai: That's why I told you. Here, have some water.\r\nKanami: Mmnn...\r\nMai: Ah...\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nKanami: Phwah. It feels like you've been helping me out every step of the way today, Mai-chan.\r\nYui: Mirja-san, please let me have some of your water-.\r\nMirja: Here you go.\r\nYui: I'm drinking it, Mirja-san!\r\nMirja: ...I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention my name every time.\r\nAkira: Yui, let me see it next. It's rough sweating this much without anything to drink.\r\nMirja: Both of you, please be careful not to drink too much. What little we have is precious.\r\nKanami: Do you want a drink too, Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: ...Sure. I'll have just a few sips.\r\nKanami: I never thought I'd be this grateful for some water, huh-.\r\nHiyori: [gulp gulp]... It's not something you'd normally pay attention to.\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nMai: ......\r\nKanami: Let's keep this up and pull through! I'm sure we only have to wait a little bit longer!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: A Flash of Inspiration in the Steamy Heat...!\r\n\r\nHiyori: Ughh... It's so hot it makes me want to tie up my hair.\r\nKanami: Your hair is pretty long, Hiyori-chan.\r\nMai: If only I had a hair tie on me.\r\nHiyori: It's fine, Mai. If I bunch it up with my hand like this, it already feels a lot different.\r\nYui: Kh... With her hair bunched up like that, I'm getting hit with a rare side of Hiyori-chan's charms... Her nape's so cute too!\r\nHiyori: Between how hot and muggy it is in here, I can't even bring myself to say anything.\r\nYui: Are you doing okay, Hiyori-chan? As an apology, I'll fan you. How's that? Does it feel cooler?\r\nHiyori: ...A little bit. Still, why are you...\r\nMai: Y-Yui-chan!? Fanning your skirt around... You shouldn't do that!\r\nYui: But, this fans the most air, doesn't it? I don't have a real fan or any kind of sheet to use.\r\nAkira: Yui, do it over my way too.\r\nYui: I'm on it!\r\nMirja: With all this heat, our standards of judgment are evaporating...\r\nKanami: Then, I'm doing it too! If we both fan with our skirts, I'm sure it'll--\r\nMai: YOU ARE NOT DOING THAT! ABSOLUTELY NOT!\r\nKanami: ...O-Okay!?\r\nMai: That goes for everyone else too! As a toji, and as a girl... Please act with some decency!\r\n\r\nKanami: We're all out of water by now... aren't we.\r\nMirja: We all drank it little by little, but in this heat, it wouldn't last regardless.\r\nAkira: On top of that, the sweat and humidity's making my shirt sticky and gross...\r\nAkira: What Mai said's still right and all, but... You gotta compromise at some point. I'm taking my clothes off.\r\nMai: ...I-Inago-san?\r\nKanami: Me too...\r\nMirja: What matters most is preserving our lives... Taking that option is unavoidable.\r\nMai: ...!?\r\nKanami: Mai-chan... We came here to put on our swimsuits anyway, so this really isn't all that different!\r\nMai: Ehhh...\r\nMai: (...Is it though? I feel like it's still wrong...)\r\nYui: Ahh~... If this is the last thing I see before I die, I'll die satisfied...\r\nMirja: I want to say this is the same as her usual self, but... Even Yamashiro Yui is in poor condition.\r\nSayaka: It's open...! Mai, Kanami, Hiyori!\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan! Ahh~... I'm so glad to see you.\r\nKofuki: So hot... What is this, a sauna? Everybody still alive~?\r\nKofuki: ...Wait, what're you all looking like that for!? Well, I guess if it's this hot, what else can you do.\r\nKofuki: We brought you stuff to drink. You'd better be grateful!\r\nMirja: We're in your debt... Shichinosato Kofuki, Itomi Sayaka.\r\nAkira: [gulp gulp gulp]... Ahh. Who'd have thought some ice cold water'd be this tasty. Seriously... You saved our asses.\r\nSayaka: Kanami and everyone else, you should drink too.\r\nKanami: Sure!\r\nHiyori: We were right at our limit...\r\nMai: We really were... The water bottle feels so cool and nice...\r\nSayaka: You too, Yui. It's cold and tasty.\r\nYui: Thanks, Sayaka-chan! You're an angel!\r\nSayaka: No, don't mention it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: A Moment at a Summer Festival Spent with Fireworks\r\n\r\nSayaka: Mai. Do you have free time the day after tomorrow?\r\nMai: I think I should be available. Why?\r\nSayaka: There's going to be a festival nearby. I want to go together.\r\nSayaka: Because we've been busy with missions, I haven't been together with you lately. I think the festival will definitely be fun.\r\nMai: You're probably right. Why don't we go enjoy ourselves together, since it's been a while.\r\nSayaka: ...Mm!\r\n\r\nSayaka: Mai, she's still not here. I didn't get any messages either... What happened?\r\nSayaka: (Mai will come for sure. I want to take a look around at everything, so Mai can have fun when she gets here.)\r\n\r\nSayaka: I think she'll be hungry when she arrives, so, takoyaki... or yakisoba? They have okonomiyaki too. I can't decide.\r\nSayaka: After that, we can eat shaved ice while we watch the fireworks... It might be fun to try the shooting range and goldfish scooping too.\r\nSayaka: ...Nn. I smell something sweet... from over this way.\r\nSayaka: \"Baby castella\"...?\r\nStall Worker: Missy, you never eaten one of them before?\r\nSayaka: I haven't.\r\nStall Worker: Go on and try one. If you like it, come and buy some more. Here.\r\nSayaka: Thank you.\r\nSayaka: -! It's tasty...\r\nSayaka: After I meet with my friend, I'll come buy some for sure.\r\nSayaka: (If I eat these with Mai, I know it'll taste even better...)\r\n\r\nSayaka: In a few minutes... it'll be 8 o'clock. The fireworks will be over soon too. Today is already...\r\nSayaka: (Will I not get to go around the festival with Mai...?)\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan... I'm sorry! I didn't think I would be this late.\r\nSayaka: Mai...!\r\nMai: My phone ran out of batteries too, so I couldn't contact you. Ahh, thank goodness I found you.\r\nSayaka: Mm. We can see the last fireworks too. You made it in time.\r\nMai: Ah, there they go! Woww, it's so pretty... Look, Sayaka-chan.\r\nSayaka: They're twinkling... That's amazing.\r\nMai: As you'd expect from the last rocket, it sure had a lot of impact. What should we do from here?\r\nSayaka: I thought of a lot of places I wanted to go see with you.\r\nMai: In that case, I guess I'll leave everything to you, Sayaka-chan.\r\nSayaka: Mm. This way! First, we'll--\r\n\r\nMai: Since we were their last customers, the takoyaki stall gave us some extra.\r\nSayaka: The extras... There were kind of a lot of them.\r\nSayaka: I think my belly might be full after that... But I want to eat these with you, Mai.\r\nSayaka: They were really tasty.\r\nMai: These are baby castella? Then, I'll have some. --Mmm, they're sweet and delicious.\r\nSayaka: They're soft and covered in lots of maple syrup... I feel like I could eat any amount of them... Ohm.\r\nMai: You really seem to like them. I don't eat them very often myself, but I do like them too.\r\nMai: (It shouldn't be that hard to make baby castella. Maybe I'll make them for her as a snack next time?)\r\nSayaka: There were still... more places I wanted to see with you though.\r\nMai: Lots of them have already started closing up their stalls, haven't they.\r\nSayaka: But, I'm glad I got to see the festival with you, Mai.\r\nMai: I feel the same way. Thank you for inviting me. Let's go out again some other day, when we don't have missions.\r\nSayaka: Okay!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: The Smells of Summer and Canteen Cooked Rice\r\n\r\nAkira: Ahh, even in the summer, it feels nice and fresh in the morning up on a plateau!\r\nYomi: You're right. The air is cool and clear.\r\nAkira: Right? Didn't I call it when I said we should spend the night here?\r\nYomi: Though, after you suggested we camp here right after our mission, I did wonder if you had lost your mind.\r\nAkira: ...Ouch. The people at the campsite even said they'd lend us their equipment. We just had to buy something to eat.\r\nAkira: It was probably a good change of pace for the rest of them too, and anyway, I'm hungry, so let's get to making breakfast!\r\nYomi: Alright. I'd like something warm to eat. More specifically, I'd like freshly cooked rice.\r\nAkira: Figured you'd say that. I'm counting on you for the rice. I'll be getting the perfect side dish ready for it.\r\nYomi: Please do.\r\n\r\nAkira: Hey. That rice you've got cooking smells good.\r\nYomi: I had the rice soak in water, so it should cook nicely.\r\nYomi: Though, if I wanted to cook it to the best of my ability, I would want to let it soak for another thirty minutes or so...\r\nAkira: Waiting an hour to eat is pushing it, don't you think.\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYomi: Isn't rice something you should put up with an empty stomach for?\r\nAkira: It's not like I don't get you, but, after I went and foil roasted this salmon, I don't want it getting cold.\r\nAkira: I threw in a bunch of onions, carrots, and shimeji mushrooms too. You're gonna love it.\r\nYomi: It seems like it would complement the rice.\r\nAkira: What, is rice the main dish here...? Ahh, this smell's making me want miso soup now. I shoulda bought some while I was out.\r\nYomi: We both... made some oversights.\r\nYomi: The rice should be cooked. Once it's steamed for a bit, we can eat.\r\n\r\nAkira: Mmm~~, that's so good! You seriously cook rice better than anybody!\r\nYomi: You flatter me too much. The roasted salmon and soft-boiled eggs you made are delicious too.\r\nAkira: Yeah, but that's all easy stuff to make.\r\nAkira: Seeing you staring down that canteen of rice earlier, it reminded me of that school camp trip we did back in 5th grade. Didn't you cook us rice back then too?\r\nYomi: I did. It was my first time cooking outdoors with a canteen, but I really wanted to try it.\r\nYomi: Back then... I was too slow in turning the rice over, so lots of it ended up scorched at the bottom.\r\nAkira: But y'know, I still really like rice when it's scorched. And we were having curry, so nobody cared much.\r\nAkira: That school camping trip sure was fun. We couldn't get to sleep, so we stayed up talking, and then the teacher got mad.\r\nYomi: That was because you were talking too loudly.\r\nAkira: Was it? You remember that pretty good. Hard to think that back then, we still didn't even know yet if we'd be toji-.\r\nYomi: I know.\r\nYomi: I wouldn't have imagined you would go dye your hair like that either, Akira.\r\nAkira: Here I am going a little down memory lane, and you've gotta bring that up? You think it doesn't look good on me? It looks good, right...?\r\nYomi: It does look good.\r\nAkira: See?\r\nAkira: Anyway, we're done eating, so how 'bout we clean things up before we head back-.\r\nYomi: Let's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/sut446\r\n[Swimsuit 20 - Mirja: Start]: Stroll\r\n\r\nOn a day off...\r\n\r\nYui: Hahh... Hahh... Heeh... Heeh...\r\nMirja: ...\r\nYui: Ffh... Ffh... Hehh... Hehh...\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui.\r\nYui: Wh-What is it, Mirja-san...?\r\nMirja: You didn't need to follow me along on my stroll, you know?\r\nMirja: We all had the opportunity to come here together on vacation.\r\nMirja: It isn't too late for you to turn back. Why not go enjoy yourself with Asakura Mihono and the others?\r\nYui: No way, I'm not going back! I'll be there to protect your pale skin, Mirja-san...!\r\nYui: Until I rub sunscreen all over you with my own hands!!\r\nMirja: ...\r\nMirja: Anyway, because it's down by the river, the air here is cooler than I expected.\r\nMirja: And there's such fine weather today.\r\nYui: That's for sure, it is really nice out...\r\nMirja: ......In spite of that, it looks to me like you're struggling quite a bit?\r\nYui: That's because... I couldn't sleep much last night, and I didn't eat breakfast either...\r\nMirja: Honestly... Here, have this.\r\nYui: Is that ramune? Thanks......\r\nYui: PFHAGH!?\r\nYui: What's with this!? It's sweet and sour and bitter and solid and salty and sourly sour!?\r\nMirja: It's the ramune Ban Tsugumi gave me to combat the summer heat.\r\nYui: Kn-Knowing that it's Tsugumi-san's... I'm not surprised it's awful...\r\nMirja: ...It looks like it was a little overwhelming.\r\nMirja: Why don't we stop and take a short rest here?\r\nYui: Sounds great!\r\nYui: Mirja-san, since we're already in our swimsuits, let's go in the river!\r\nMirja: ......\r\nYui: Do you not want to...?\r\nMirja: No, it is what we came here for, so I'll enjoy myself as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/sig5hu\r\n[Swimsuit 20 - Mirja: End]: A Short Rest\r\n\r\nYui: YAHOOO-!\r\nYui: Phew... This feels so good...\r\nYui: Mirja-saaan! Hurry up and come in the river!\r\nMirja: ......\r\nYui: ...?\r\nYui: What are you just staring at the water for-!\r\nMirja: ...The wildlife in this mountain river must be abundant.\r\nYui: Where'd that come from...?\r\nMirja: They moved away when you jumped in, but I saw the shapes of fish swimming.\r\nMirja: I didn't exactly get a good look at them... Given the season, perhaps they were Ayu?\r\nYui: You think so?\r\nMirja: You can also catch Amago, Yamame, and Iwana during the summertime. Though, I'm unsure if those fish would be in this river here...\r\nYui: We should've brought a fishing rod with us. If there were that many fish, we might've been able to go all out for our lunch.\r\nMirja: True, we potentially could have, though... As beginners, I'm not sure how many we would be able to fish out...\r\nYui: Well, forget about that for now; hurry up and come in the water!\r\nMirja: Alright then... Mm!?\r\nYui: What's wrong?\r\nMirja: Just now, a spider went drifting by.\r\nYui: A spider!?\r\nYui: Wh-Wh-Wh-Where was it!?\r\nMirja: It's about to pass right in front of you.\r\nYui: Eh? ...GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nYui: Mirja-san, there's a spider! A spider!\r\nMirja: It isn't a venomous spider, so you shouldn't worry. It won't harm you.\r\nYui: That doesn't help! There's no maiden in the world who'd keep calm with a spider in front of their face!\r\nYui: Can I hug onto you for safety!?\r\nMirja: Absolutely not.\r\nYui: Looking around more, there sure are a lot of bugs... Eep!?\r\nMirja: We are out in nature, so that's only natural.\r\nMirja: Phew, that was a good rest. Now then, to continue our stroll.\r\nYui: You aren't getting in after all!?\r\nYui: You were just toying with me, Mirja-san~! But, you treating me like that feels pretty nice too!\r\nMirja: ...What are you talking about?

Though I figured you'd be wandering around closer to the mansion...\r\nButterfly Shaped Aradama: ...\r\nAkira: So that's why. You'd make it this far if Yomi's leading you around.\r\nAkira: We don't want to get rough with you if we don't have to. Come with us, Mihono.\r\nYuuki: Please, Mihono-san.\r\nYuuki: If you won't... Akira-nee-sama and I will bring you with us, even if we need to cut you down.\r\nMihono: I'm on your side with trying to reduce the amount of toji getting hurt... But, I'm sure what you and Hitakami-san are doing is wrong!\r\nYuuki: I know that Makoto-nee-sama isn't wrong. I want you to believe in her too.\r\nAkira: ...Either way, you already know what's going on. You can't go back anymore.\r\nMihono: I'll... trust in the investigation team.\r\nAkira: Sure you would.\r\nAkira: The investigation team wouldn't abandon you either. They'd give everything trying to do something about Kanayamahime.\r\nAkira: But, that's as far as they'd get. You can't stop Kanayamahime from awakening. Makkochan's probably the only one who can, alright?\r\nMihono: Then...\r\nAkira: I won't tell you you've gotta work with us forever. I won't make you join our faction either.\r\nAkira: Just, stay until we can settle this thing with Kanayamahime.\r\nMihono: ...And in return, I have to help with your experiments, right?\r\nAkira: That's right.\r\nAkira: Y'know, I think pretty highly of you. I've been watching you a long time, under Makocchan's orders.\r\nMihono: Huh?\r\nAkira: You didn't know, didja?\r\nAkira: The first time we met was at that shopping mall, but I'd known all about you before then. I'd heard about you from your buddies too.\r\nAkira: So what I'm saying is, I know just what kinda girl you are. And honestly, in the back of my mind... I knew you were never gonna work with us.\r\nMihono: If you knew I wouldn't go along with you, then... why bother with this?\r\nAkira: I told ya, didn't I? I took a liking to you. That's why, just give in on this just this once. We won't do anything bad.\r\nAkira: Makocchan and us'll do everything we can. We'll figure something out with Kanayamahime, and we'll make sure there's no more failures with tamayori!\r\nAkira: So come on, Mihono... Just help out Makocchan.\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: I'm sorry.\r\nAkira: ...So that's it.\r\nAkira: For Makocchan... I'd do whatever it takes.\r\nAkira: Yuuki! We're bringing Mihono back with us! Don't go easy on her!!\r\nYuuki: Right! I feel the same as you do, Akira-nee-sama!\r\nAkira: Last time we went up against each other was back in that shopping mall.\r\nMihono: ...Don't think I'm the same as I was back then.\r\nAkira: You are. If you're not using Kanayamahime, you're not gonna beat me.\r\nMihono: I'll use her... It scares me, and I really don't want to, but...\r\nMihono: If it'll get me back to see everybody again...!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Hitakami's Experiments\r\n\r\nAt the same time.\r\n\r\n???: Ah, aghh, ah, aghhh...\r\nKiyoka: What... is that...?\u3000\r\nMirja: There's an aradama wrapped over her body... No; or has her body itself turned into aradama...?\r\nYui: When they said the Hitakami faction was doing experiments, is this what they made...?\r\nHitakami Toji L: That's... one of the failed tamayori subjects...?\r\nHitakami Toji H: Who went and brought one out here...?\r\nKofuki: Oi oi, even the enemy's backing off. Isn't that thing with them?\r\nChie: Makoto... Just what are you doing...?\r\n???: Haghh, hghh...\r\nHitakami Toji L: Kh, we might not be able to control her, but we can still use this! We'll beat down the intruders with her!\r\n???: RRRRGGHHHHHHHH!!!\r\nEveryone: !!\r\nKiyoka: Did she just use hachimanriki...?\r\nMirja: It didn't look as though she did.\r\nMirja: Though... to have that much power without hachimanriki... That's clearly not something a human could do...\r\nYui: I wouldn't want to fight with that either.\r\nKiyoka: B-But, can her body even take it...\r\n???: ...et, not yet...\r\nKofuki: Seems fine to me.\r\nMirja: This is troubling... How should we respond to this... Setouchi Chie?\r\nChie: ...We know much too little about what we're up against, so I'd like to avoid combat as much as possible, but...\r\n???: HAAAAAAAHHHH!!\r\nYui: UWAH!?\r\nKofuki: Oi! It's not like we've got all the time in the world here!\r\nKiyoka: Chie-san!\r\nChie: We're counterattacking! Mirja, give us combat orders!!\r\nMirja: Understood.\r\nMirja: Our only threat here is that enemy. Eliminate the other toji first and focus all your efforts on that one!\r\nMirja: Don't take her attacks head on! Utilize the openings after each attack!\r\nMirja: Here she comes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Unexpected Help\r\n\r\n???: Ugh, urghh...\r\nKiyoka: She still won't go down...?\r\nYui: I get the feeling I've seen this scene in zombie movies before...\r\nMirja: If you can speak that casually about it, you must be taking this stride.\r\nYui: It's not like that... It's more like, if I don't joke about it, fighting a toji in this state is too sad...\r\nChie: That's for sure...\r\n???: You're right; this is as ugly as it gets.\r\nYui: That voice!?\r\nYume: What're you onee-sans doing here?\r\nMirja: The special defense team?\r\nMirja: You aren't here acting on Asakura Mihono's case... are you?\r\nMaki: That's right. We're here on our own circumstances.\r\nMaki: But that doesn't mean we're cold enough to ignore your situation. Yomi.\r\nYomi: Right.\r\nYomi: Please follow after these aradama. They will lead you to Asakura-san.\r\nMaki: Go. You can leave things here to us.\r\nYume: More like, you're getting in our way!\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san and me can handle that thing easy.\r\nChie: ......Mirja.\r\nMirja: ...Understood. We'll leave you to it.\r\nMaki: Good, that's a smart call. Get going!\r\nYume: All that's left is to bring down that onee-san, huh.\r\nMaki: Even looking like that, we're still up against a toji. Are you alright with that, Yume?\r\nYume: I know already. I won't overdo it like back when I fought against Mokusa.\r\nMaki: That's good then.\r\nMaki: Now, let's bring her under control!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Welcome and I'm Back\r\n\r\nMirja: The direction Satsuki Yomi's aradama are moving in... It's the opposite direction of the mansion.\r\nYui: So Mihono-chan's this far out in these hills. Without them leading us, we might not have met up with her.\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan is probably running away, isn't she... Which means... wouldn't she be in a pretty bad situation?\r\nMirja: There's no mistaking that she must have fought against the Hitakami faction.\r\nMirja: We have no way of knowing what happened or the result, but... her current circumstances can't be good.\r\nKofuki: She could've also just gotten lost out here. And it wouldn't be weird if her phone just wasn't getting a signal out here.\r\nMirja: That would be the most harmonious outcome. Though... In that case, I can't understand the reason for the Hitakami faction being on such high alert.\r\nKofuki: I guess so. What a pain in the ass-.\r\nChie: Mihono-chan...\r\nChie: ...Let's hurry! We should reach her as soon as we can.\r\n\r\nMihono: Huh? The aradama stopped moving...? Does that mean I should just wait here?\r\nMihono: More of these aradama...?\r\nChie: Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: ......Eh?\r\nChie: Thank goodness, you're safe! Look how dirty you are... Are you hurt anywhere?\r\nMihono: Chii-nee... And, everybody else... Am I dreaming?\r\nMihono: Why would all of you be out here in the mountains...\r\nKofuki: C'mon, we didn't hike through all this just for this to be a dream.\r\nKofuki: Though, it figures you'd say something like that, Mihocchi.\r\nYui: Mm! That's Mihono-chan, no doubt about it!\r\nKiyoka: You're not dreaming...! We came to get you, Hono-chan!\r\nMihono: You really did...?\r\nMihono: Guys...!\r\nKofuki: O-Oi!? What're you crying out of nowhere for!!\r\nMihono: Of course I'm gonna cry...!\r\nMihono: Cause, I was all alone up in the mountains in Tohoku, and Hitakami-san's toji were chasing after me, and I couldn't use Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power...\r\nYui: You worked really hard, Mihono-chan! Come and dive right into my chest!\r\nMihono: Yui~!\r\nKofuki: The two of them've lost it. Right, Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan... I'm so glaaad...\r\nKofuki: Now you're crying too!?\r\nKiyoka: Of course I'd be crying...\r\nMirja: ...Asakura Mihono. I'm glad to see you're safe.\r\nMihono: Mirja-san...\r\nChie: I'm so sorry, Mihono-chan. I... I had no idea what Makoto was getting into now...\r\nMihono: That's not it! That's now how this should go, Chii-nee!\r\nMihono: This is... It's my fault for not listening properly to what you and Mirja-san were telling me.\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono...\r\nMihono: I just let it get to my head. Since that power made me stronger... I'm sorry, Chii-nee, Mirja-san.\r\nMirja: You aren't the only one at fault. When this was troubling you, Setouchi Chie and I should have stayed closer at your side.\r\nChie: Mirja and I thought, if we could just do something about Kashuu Kiyomitsu... But you were worrying about this the whole time, Mihono-chan...\r\nMihono: Kashuu Kiyomitsu's... No. Hitakami-san told me about what's really causing this power...\r\nMihono: My strength... It wasn't coming from Kashuu Kiyomitsu after all.\r\nMihono: I'm...\r\nMirja: Please tell us everything after we've returned. For now... Welcome back, Asakura Mihono.\r\nMihono: ...!\r\nKofuki: Wait, isn't it weird telling her welcome back when we're the ones who came out to get her?\r\nMirja: Is it really?\r\nKiyoka: I feel like it's alright to tell her welcome back.\r\nYui: Then, I'm on Kofuki-san's side here! We're enemies this time, Kiyoka-chan!\r\nKofuki: I mean, who cares either way? It just crossed my mind.\r\nYui: She betrayed me~!\r\nChie: Okay, that's enough fooling around now.\r\nChie: It's too soon for us to relax yet.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nChie: What's wrong, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: ...It just feels like, I'm really back.\r\nMihono: I'm back, everybody!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Tamayori (1)\r\n\r\nMaki: HAAAAH!!\r\nYume: Alright, now you're done!\r\n???: Grgh...!\r\nYume: I'll give you that you're a little tough and got some power, but that's it. You're no big deal.\r\n???: Ugh, urgh......!\r\nYume: Ah, she ran off! Stop!\r\nAkira: You're the ones who should stop. Trampling over somebody's yard and all.\r\nMaki: Inago Akira and Toribane Yuuki?\r\nAkira: The elite guard... Or wait, you're the special defense team now? Well, it's all the same.\r\nYomi: ...Akira.\r\nAkira: Hm? Hey, it's been a while, Yomi. Seems like you've been through a lot, but I'm glad you're looking alright.\r\nYomi: How is Hitakami-san doing?\r\nAkira: She's just fine. Wanna see her?\r\nYomi: ...No.\r\nYuuki: Akira-nee-sama, please don't make small talk with the enemy. Especially not in front of... Tsubakuro Yume.\r\nYume: Have we met somewhere before? Since I don't remember you, I'm pretty sure that means you're weak.\r\nYuuki: This is our first time meeting. However... I know about you. What you did to everyone at Mokusa.\r\nYume: ......\r\nAkira: ...Yuuki. The way you are now, you're not beating Tsubakuro Yume.\r\nYuuki: With all due respect, Nee-sama. Do you only pick fights that you know you'll win?\r\nAkira: ...\r\nYuuki: You don't, do you?\r\nAkira: Haha! You got me there! I don't mind that attitude one bit, Yuuki!\r\nYuuki: I've been watching your back, Nee-sama. So, even if we won't win... We'll give them a fight!\r\nYume: Fine by me, I'll take you on!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Tamayori (2)\r\n\r\nYume: And, there.\r\nYuuki: Rgh!\r\nYume: That's my win, uh... Who were you again?\r\nYuuki: I'm... Toribane Yuuki.\r\nYume: I'll take you anytime, so whenever you think you can beat me, bring it on, Onee-san.\r\nMaki: That leaves only you left.\r\nAkira: Tch... You guys really are tough as hell.\r\nMaki: Inago Akira. Put a stop to your research.\r\nMaki: The Sword Administration Bureau can't turn a blind eye to what you're doing.\r\nAkira: Hah, what a joke. You're gonna play innocent to the shit you did and talk down to us?\r\nMaki: As someone who made their own share of mistakes... I'm warning you not to make them too.\r\nAkira: ...Tch. Oi, Yomi. You're not gonna lecture me like Shidou Maki here, are ya?\r\nYomi: I am also a member of the special defense team.\r\nAkira: ...That so. Well, what can you do. We've both got our own positions. And what we think matters most ain't the same.\r\nAkira: --Yuuki, we're pulling out!\r\nYuuki: Right!\r\nMaki: Kgh...!\r\nMaki: They ran away...\r\nYomi: Will we give chase?\r\nMaki: ...No, we should hold off. This is the Hitakami's territory. Pushing in too deep could bring on too much danger.\r\nYume: I'd already pretty much figured out how strong those two are too. Well, whatever.\r\nMaki: At any rate, we should return and report to Yukari-sama and Akane-sama. The Hitakamis seem to be doing something even riskier than we thought...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: For My Desire\r\n\r\nAkira: Sorry, Makocchan. Mihono gave us the slip...\r\nYuuki: I wasn't able to be any use either...\r\nMakoto: No, I'm the one who should be apologizing. I've pressed the both of you into an unpleasant role...\r\nMakoto: Akira-chan and Yuuki-chan, the two of you have both taken an interest in Asakura-san, haven't you?\r\nMakoto: In spite of that, I had forced you to fight against her...\r\nAkira: Don't think that you forced me to do it. That was my own choice doing that.\r\nYuuki: The same goes for me. There's no need for you to feel bothered by it, Makoto-nee-sama.\r\nMakoto: Thank you very much, the both of you... I always find myself depending on your support.\r\nMakoto: Even though, by all rights, as the head of the Hitakami family, I should be much more reliable...\r\nAkira: Y'know, Makocchan. It's not like the reason I'm helping you's got anything to do with you being the head of the Hitakami family.\r\nAkira: I'm just helping you cause you're Makocchan. The same Makocchan I've known since we were kids; cause we're best buds.\r\nAkira: And when your best buds are in trouble, you do everything you can to get 'em out. That's just the way it is.\r\nYuuki: That's exactly right! I'll help you too, Makoto-nee-sama!\r\nMakoto: Akira-chan... Yuuki-chan...\r\nAkira: You'd do the same too, right? If Yuuki or me were in trouble, you'd do whatever you can for us, wouldn't you?\r\nMakoto: Yes. Of course I would.\r\nAkira: So we're the same.\r\nAkira: Ever since we were little, no matter what the three of us did, we pulled through it together. So this time too, all I'm doing is trying to help a buddy of mine out.\r\nYuuki: Please use me however you see fit, Makoto-nee-sama. The three of us work together as one.\r\nMakoto: Fufu. That's right, isn't it. I'll continue to be in your care, you two.\r\nAkira: Anyway! Let's put an end to the pity party here.\r\nAkira: While we were chasing after Mihono, we came across another failed tamayori toji. We managed to catch and put her under safety.\r\nMakoto: You did...? Thank you very much.\r\nYuuki: Those old Hitakami bosses... Next time, let's light a fire under their asses!\r\nAkira: Hey... Where'd you learn to talk like that?\r\nYuuki: From you, Akira-nee-sama.\r\nMakoto: Fufu. Bit by bit, Yuuki-chan might be coming to speak more like you, Akira-chan.\r\nAkira: Seriously...? Oi, Yuuki. You don't gotta go out of your way to copy me.\r\nYuuki: It's not that I was trying to copy you... It just happened to slip out.\r\nAkira: Sigh~... Well, it's fine.\r\nAkira: More importantly, how many failed tamayori toji are we at now...?\r\nAkira: The ones up top are working out their alibis and hiding who's doing it, so we can't even pin down who's to blame.\r\nMakoto: We can't have the girls who were experimented on remain in that state forever. We'll have to cure them, no matter what.\r\nAkira: And, to cure them, we're gonna still have to improve on what we can do with tamayori.\r\nMakoto: We cannot put it off any longer. If we could only create one successful case of a tamayori toji, we could gather enough data from it...\r\nMakoto: Now that we can no longer hope for Asakura-san's assistance, I will use myself as a tamayori test subject.\r\nAkira: Wha--!?\r\nYuuki: Y-You'll use yourself, Makoto-nee-sama!?\r\nMakoto: If you trace it back, the Atago and Hitakami come from the same bloodline. Though not nearly as much as Asakura-san, I am still suitable for tamayori.\r\nAkira: But still, there's a good chance it's gonna fail, isn't there!?\r\nMakoto: Yes. I understand that, of course.\r\nMakoto: But, if we continue to sit idly by, we won't be able to save those toji who were victims of the experimenting.\r\nMakoto: There are times that risks must be taken to achieve success. And there is no greater time for that than now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: Tamayori Toji\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Akane-sama, Yukari-sama. A report came in from Yomi-san.\r\nAkane: Please, go on.\r\nSuzuka: The Hitakami faction are attempting to create \"tamayori toji.\"\r\nSuzuka: It appears to be research into improving a toji's abilities by equipping noro onto the body.\r\nAkane: Equipping noro onto the body...\r\nSuzuka: They've already begun human experimentation, and it seems they entered combat with one of the experiment results.\r\nYukari: ...I see.\r\nAkane: What about Asakura-san?\r\nSuzuka: She safely escaped, from the sound of things.\r\nAkane: That's good to hear...\r\nAkane: Nee-sama, why do you think Hitakami-san found it necessary to bring in Asakura-san? Is there some connection between her and these tamayori toji...?\r\nYukari: We should hear that from Asakura herself. Prepare to be ready to act against whatever those details may be.\r\nAkane: ...Right."}, {"paste_key": "ciXkEQSL", "title": "pj kaoru/marching mai/valk kanami", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/ciXkEQSL", "timestamp": "", "hits": "70", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/U_8Z9M9PWSk\r\n[Pajama - Kaoru: Start]: Isn't It Fine Every Once in a While?\r\n\r\nEllen: That's the last one!

Get a beef bowl in front of the station and head home?\r\nKaoru: I'm not... gonna take that!\r\nKiyoka: S-So assertive...!\r\nEllen: What you're saying makes some sense, Kaoru.\r\nEllen: So basically, you think we should stay the night here?\r\nKaoru: Exactly. It's fine every once in a while, right?\r\nKiyoka: I do feel like I'd rather rest a little here than hurry back.\r\nKaoru: Right? Even toji need a break.\r\nEllen: If that's what we've decided on, then leave the hotel reservations to me-! I'll call a friend of mine-!\r\nKiyoka: A friend who will reserve us a hotel room...?\r\nKaoru: She's got a lot of weird friends, so don't think too hard about it.\r\n\r\nKaoru: I'm all filled up~.\r\nEllen: You sound like an old man, Kaoru.\r\nKiyoka: But, it really was delicious. You'll have to thank your friend for me, Ellen-san, for telling us about this restaurant!\r\nEllen: I'll be sure to let them know-! Now then, about the hotel... It's this way.\r\nKiyoka: What kind of hotel is it?\r\nKaoru: It's probably some little place tucked away-.\r\nKiyoka: That's what the place we ate at was like, wasn't it.\r\nEllen: Ah, I can see it.

Those are just pectoral muscles...)\r\nKaoru: (Kiyoka, this'll go a lot easier if you just don't think about it...)\r\nEllen: What about pectoral muscles?\r\nKaoru: She's probably wondering how to train 'em, right?\r\nEllen: If you want to train up your pecs, I think it'd be good to ask Makimaki about it.\r\nKiyoka: ...That's true; Shidou-san's like that too...\r\nKaoru: Anyway, how about we get to sleep.\r\nEllen: Since we're having a pajama party, we have to do a pillow fight and talk about love interests!\r\nKaoru: Huh?\r\nKiyoka: I'm not sure if that's right, but I'm interested in talking about love too!\r\nKiyoka: When you become a high schooler, do you really start getting into that kind of thing!?\r\nKaoru: Nah, not really.\r\nEllen: We're too busy with missions, after all.\r\nKiyoka: That's disappointing...\r\nEllen: Now then, all that's left is a pillow fight!\r\nKaoru: Count me out-.

Like, one that plays wind instruments?\r\nEma: Yes, that kind of marching band. And, that's where I'd like you to be the drum major... In other words, you'll be the conductor of the band.\r\nMai: You want me to do that...?\r\nEma: Yes. I think it would be a good experience for you. How do you feel about it?\r\nMai: ......\r\nMai: (A conductor... Can I really do it? I'm not so sure, but... the president must be suggesting this because she's sure I can.)\r\nMai: ...Alright then. I'll take on the role of the drum major!\r\n\r\nMai: So now, we'll begin practicing.\r\nMai: ......\r\nKanami: (Here I do it like this, and then like this...

And anyway, sorry, Mai. I screwed up again.\r\nMai: It's alright; we still have time. I'll stick with you, so let's practice lots, okay?\r\nMihono: Sure!\r\n\r\nMai: That's enough practicing for today. You did great, everyone!\r\nEveryone: Good work-!\r\nMihono: Ahh, I'm beat!

She's taught how to do a whole lot, so I want to make sure the main performance is a success for sure.\r\nKanami: Mai-chan's trying so hard for this. I'm sure she's probably practicing right now too.\r\nMihono: ...Ah, if she's teaching me this stuff, that must mean she practiced it enough to learn it that well herself.\r\nMihono: ...Sorry, Kanami! I'm going to go back and practice with Mai too!\r\nKanami: I had a feeling you'd say something like that!

Just how much effort you've been putting into this.\r\nMai: How much I have...?\r\nKanami: Yeah.

I think Ellen-chan might be right!\r\nHiyori: ...Are you really okay with this?\r\nKaoru: Don't get won over by her smooth talking. She's just here to amuse herself.\r\nKanami: That's still fine!

Let's start right off with a survey over the internet!\r\nEllen: Kanamin's promotional shots will be her in... These!\r\nEllen: An aradama hoodie, a Nenegurumi, or a valkyrie costume!\r\nKaoru: None of those are good for promotional shots!\r\nMai: But... They might look cute.\r\nSayaka: Mm, I want to see all of them.\r\nKanami: Y-You think so?\r\nKaoru: You guys... Don't come crying to me when it's your turn to put that on.\r\nHiyori: Me either.\r\nHiyori: Since I'll be having my photos taken at Mai's studio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Valkyrie - Kanami: End]: All in the Same Boat?\r\n\r\nEllen: We got the results back from Kanamin's survey!\r\nKanami: It's so tense...!\r\nEllen: They all put up a good fight, but...

I don't want to have to fight if I can help it.\r\nSuu: ...Musumi-san!\r\nSuu: (They give me support and they help me out; maybe I can depend on people from Heijou...?)\r\nSuu: I'll keep being in your care then!\r\nKiyoka: Nn? ...Mmhm, likewise.\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san, I'm relying on you to get me aradama data.\r\nKofuki: Yeah, count on it.\r\nSuu: (Ah... Thinking about this the other way around, with all these strong people here, doesn't that make this a really safe mission?)\r\nSuu: Shichinosato-san's started looking all excited too.\r\nKiyoka: That's usually how she is before we go on a mission.\r\nKofuki: You better be letting me play with some aradama-chan tough enough to be worth it, okay?\r\nMaki: No need to worry about that. We're expecting a lot from the group with you, Itomi, and Juujou.\r\nMaki: The site you're going to has a high number of outbreaks.\r\nSayaka: Understood.\r\nSuu: Ahhhhh... Why do you want to go to the most dangerous places?\r\nSuu: (I just don't get it... Are Shichinosato-san and Itomi-san actually space aliens or something...?)\r\nHokuto: Don't make that face. If it comes down to it, I'll be there to save you.\r\nSuu: Hokuto-san... I won't leave your side!!\r\nHokuto: Then we wouldn't be able to fight, would we...?\r\nSuu: ...Are you feeling that motivated for this?\r\nHokuto: I am. It's rare to join a mission alongside a select group of top fighters. There's nothing to dislike about it.\r\nKiyoka: I am feeling a little nervous, but let's try our best to keep up, Asahina-san, Inami-san.\r\nHokuto: Of course. It looks like we're about to start. Let's go.\r\nSuu: Ahhh~...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: That's Why I Said I Didn't Want to Do This...\r\n\r\nHokuto: YAAH!\r\nHokuto: Leave the smaller sized aradama to us. Could you handle that big aradama!\r\nTsugumi: Don't worry about any coming up behind you, Itomi-san, Juujou-san.\r\nHiyori: Got it. Let's go, Sayaka.\r\nSayaka: Mm... We'll finish this quickly.\r\n\r\nKofuki: What's wrong, what's wrong!\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOO...!!\r\nKofuki: Oh! Looks like you wanna keep going; so I'll play with you!\r\nKiyoka: It feels like more and more aradama keep coming here...\r\nKiyoka: Kofuki-san, if it's possible, let's try sticking close together to fight!\r\nKiyoka: Ah, she ran off. Please come baaaack!\r\nKofuki: Just gimme a minute.\r\nAradama: ...GUGGGI!\r\nSuu: ...Waaahh!? They came this way!?\r\nSuu: I feel like I'm in danger; I'm running away!\r\nKiyoka: Not you too, Inami-san!? There's still aradama that way!\r\n\r\nAradama: ......\r\nKofuki: This's it for you--\r\nSuu: Save me... pleaseeeeee...!\r\nKofuki: Huh!? Hey... You're getting in the way of the good part!\r\nSuu: Buttt...\r\nKofuki: Well, I'll give you credit for bringing me more aradama-chan at least!\r\nAradama: ...GGGII!\r\nSuu: Eeeeeek!?\r\nKiyoka: ...Inami-san!? Whatever you do, keep your utsushi up!\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Hokuto and the others were--\r\n\r\nHiyori: Things are taken care of over here.\r\nHiyori: It was a real help having you handle the aradama following the big one around, Asahina-san, Ban-san.\r\nSayaka: Mm... We could focus on it thanks to you and Tsugumi.\r\nTsugumi: No need to thank us. It's our mission.\r\nHokuto: I only did what I was capable of.\r\nHokuto: (Itomi Sayaka, Juujou Hiyori... They really are strong.)\r\nHokuto: (It's not that I think I'll get the chance to become that strong just by completing missions with them, but, a toji's strength... There might be no limit to it.)\r\nHokuto: (Though... Why are there this many talented individuals in one group to begin with?)\r\nScreaming Voice: EEEEEEKK!?\r\nScreaming Voice: SOMEBODY HELP MEEEEEEEEEE...!\r\nHiyori: Just now; that's...!\r\nHokuto: ...It's Suu. Let's hurry.\r\n\r\nSuu: Musumi-san... Shichinosato-san! I'm begging you... I'm begging you, so... Hurry!\r\nKofuki: There's still way more aradama-chan to go through, so sit put!\r\nKiyoka: Inami-san, you reapplied utsushi just now, didn't you? That makes the third time... There aren't a lot of toji who can reuse utsushi that much.\r\nSayaka: We came to save you, but, you seem okay...?\r\nSuu: I'm not okay at all... At all!\r\nSayaka: I saw you reapply utsushi just now. You can still fight.\r\nSuu: I've been in a huge pinch this whole time!\r\nHokuto: She can still fight. Suu can use utsushi even more than this.\r\nSuu: Why are you telling them that!?\r\nSayaka: That's amazing...\r\nKofuki: In that case, you can keep on being aradama bait for me!\r\nSuu: Ehhhhh!?\r\nAradama: ......\r\nTsugumi: Certain data does indicate that aradama also tend to attack weaker seeming targets. Though it's still in need of verification.\r\nSuu: Don't just decide that on your own...!! I'm not an aradama charmer, okay!?\r\nSayaka: You don't need to worry. We'll protect you, Suu.\r\nSuu: Th-Thank you very much!\r\nSuu: But still, I want you to save me right now! Get me out of this situation...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: If Possible... I'd Like a Break From Missions for a While \r\n\r\nSuu: Eep!?\r\nTsugumi: Are you doing alright-?\r\nSuu: I just got a little spooked by the sound of okatana hitting an aradama...\r\nSuu: Even though I realize everyone's getting rid of the aradama.\r\nTsugumi: I see. Though, Inami-san, it seems like you can use utsushi a great number of times, so if you were able to overcome your fears facing aradama, it would be very unlikely you would get hurt.\r\nSuu: Thinking about it is one thing, but actually doing it is a whole different story.\r\nTsugumi: I understand. Raw data gathered from aradama will be biased, so it's vital to see the aradama moving about up close like this as well.\r\nTsugumi: Today is looking to be an auspicious day, with all the aradama I've gotten to see and the data to collect.\r\nSuu: Ah.\r\nSuu: (This person too... She's dangerous after all!)\r\nSuu: (I don't know how many times I've thought this now, but... Let this be over already-!)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: I'm leading this aradama over towards you!\r\nKofuki: Sure! Don't worry about beating 'em, just keep sending more and more aradama-chan my way!\r\nKiyoka: We're only doing it like this for today, okay?\r\nKofuki: I'm more than happy to do this anytime though.\r\nHokuto: Shichinosato-san! Would it be alright for me to send one more aradama at you then?\r\nKofuki: I'll take any of them you've got!\r\nKofuki: Step right up, fresh aradama-chan!\r\nHokuto: (We weren't at all able to reach the coordination we were working towards during practice, in the end.)\r\nHokuto: (With Shichinosato-san, we could hardly even take a formation.)\r\nKiyoka: Honestly... You're only paying attention to the aradama that come right in front of you.\r\nHokuto: (But outside of practice, Shichinosato-san is like a different person.)\r\nHokuto: (And Musumi-san, understanding her nature, smoothly supports her while fighting the aradama.)\r\nHokuto: I can't let myself lose here either... can I.\r\n\r\nSanae: Great work, everyone-. Today was a little rough on us, huh.\r\nHiyori: Were you in charge of leading a different group, Iwakura-san?\r\nSanae: Mmhm. I was working together with the people from my group to stop the aradama from leaving the predicted area, and also helping escort anyone who couldn't evacuate on time.\r\nSayaka: I wouldn't really be able to do that.\r\nSanae: Everyone has their own role. I wouldn't be able to fight like you can either, Itomi-san.\r\nHiyori: Sayaka. Since there were so many aradama, you must have taken out a lot of them, right?\r\nSayaka: I stopped remembering how many halfway.\r\nHokuto: If we're comparing numbers, you would have gotten the most, wouldn't you?\r\nKofuki: Probably-. I got to play with so many aradama-chan I couldn't even keep up counting, so I'm satisfied.\r\nKofuki: I've got her to thank for that too.\r\nHokuto: Suu wouldn't feel so fortunate though... You really do love to fight aradama, don't you.\r\nHokuto: I can't overlook that you ignored both orders and the unit's formation, but adaptability is a necessity, and I admire your dedication to the mission.\r\nHokuto: I suppose it's fine so long as you don't cause any trouble for the girls you're assigned to work with.\r\nKofuki: Heh, Kiyoka can handle it so it's all good.\r\n\r\nSuu: I don't know how many times I thought I was going to die today... I mean it, I'm on my last legs.\r\nHokuto: Though, since you weren't hurt in the end, it turned out fine.\r\nSuu: No way; this time was bad enough that I want a special vacation or something. My heart took more than enough damage!\r\nMaki: What's this? I'd heard Inami was about to drop from exhaustion, but you look lively enough to me.\r\nSuu: Shidou-san!? D-Did you need something from us?\r\nMaki: Nothing in particular. Just checking in on the toji who took part in the mission.\r\nHokuto: You elite guard must have had your hands full too. Though, there's something on my mind. Mind if I ask you?\r\nMaki: Go right ahead.\r\nHokuto: Whichever way you look at it, don't you think the group Suu and I were put in had an excessive amount of fighting strength?\r\nMaki: Ahh, that's what you mean. The plan was always to make one team of more average ability and one with more capable fighters.\r\nMaki: Just in order to counter any powerful aradama that appeared. On top of that, there were a lot of unique individuals, so it was Suzuka's thinking that having them all in one place would make them easier to manage.\r\nHokuto: ...Because of that, we had a lot of trouble.\r\nSuu: And I... I ended up being some kind of aradama bait... It was the worst.\r\nMaki: ...That must have been difficult. Though, while the average level of students chosen for this training was high, not many could keep up with that group you were in.\r\nMaki: Knowing you two, I suggested you. And, it doesn't look like I was wrong.\r\nSuu: Sigh... Just because I can use utsushi a little more than usual, I wish you wouldn't forget how weak I am...\r\nSayaka: I... I want to see how many times you can apply utsushi.\r\nSuu: I-Itomi-sama!? How long have you been here for!?\r\nSayaka: Not long. I saw you from the front entrance.\r\nSayaka: But, why are you using \"sama\"? I'm... not that important.\r\nSuu: Itomi-sama... You're way too strong, aren't you... So that's why!\r\nSayaka: There are toji stronger than me. ...You can call me Sayaka.\r\nSuu: No no no... There's no way I could say your name that bluntly! At least let me use Sayaka-san!!\r\nSayaka: Alright. And... How many more times can you apply utsushi, Suu? I want to see.\r\nSuu: How many more times...? I'm all out of stock for today, so I can't show you any more utsushis!\r\nSayaka: That's a shame...\r\nSayaka: But, we go to the same school. I'll look forward to when we go on missions together.\r\nSuu: It's not like it's any fun to see either...\r\nHokuto: ......\r\nSuu: Hokuto-san, why do you look like you're enjoying this. You're a bully.\r\nHokuto: That's not what I was smiling about. I was just thinking, it might have been difficult, but this was a good experience for you.\r\nHokuto: If nothing comes up, I won't be leaving for another two days, so do you want to go out somewhere and enjoy ourselves tomorrow?\r\nSuu: Absolutely! I'll start coming up with a list of places to go right now!\r\nHokuto: You really do change moods at the drop of a hat, don't you."}, {"paste_key": "k76Jm42a", "title": "valkyrie yomi/misogi kaoru", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/k76Jm42a", "timestamp": "", "hits": "72", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/ZYwru7GiMV0\r\n[Valkyrie - Yomi: Start]: A Sudden Call from Akira\r\n\r\nAkira: Oiii, Yomi! Here, over here~.\r\nYomi: I could tell where you were without you having to shout.\r\nAkira: You just looked like you were kinda spacing out over there. Anyway, ready to go?\r\n\r\nYomi: I was wondering where you were taking me. A cakery?\r\nAkira: What's wrong with that? The limited run parfaits this place makes get a lot of talk for being good.\r\nYomi: You still like parfaits like you used to.\r\nYomi: So, what was the reason you called me here for?\r\nAkira: I had a little something to take care of around here. So I thought I'd give you a call. It's no fun eating by yourself, right?\r\nYomi: ......\r\nAkira: I know you've probably got a lot going on too, but you've gotta take a breather every now and then.\r\nYomi: I have to be part of a promotional photo shoot later today, so I can't stay here for very long.\r\nAkira: Huhh? What're you doing a photo shoot for?\r\nYomi: You could say it has to do with the results of the Miss Five Traditions competition that was held the other day, I suppose.\r\nAkira: Ahh, oh yeah, they put those out, huh.\r\nAkira: That reminds me, didn't you place pretty high yourself? I was surprised to hear it. I never thought you'd be up there.\r\nAkira: Though, it must be boring as hell to sit through some photo shoot cause of it.\r\nYomi: I can't neglect this, considering it's part of my duties as a toji.\r\nAkira: You got so straight laced. But, if that's what you're set on. You better do it right.\r\nAkira: You gonna be doing it in your uniform? They'd probably get mad if you wore something too casual; so a jacket like mine's out.\r\nYomi: You're probably right. Though, this time it's arranged for me to wear a valkyrie themed costume, along with Tsubakuro-san and the others.\r\nAkira: ......\r\nAkira: What're you talking about?\r\nYomi: You may not know about it, Akira, but valkyries were something that was part of Norse mythology--\r\nAkira: It's not like I don't know what valkyries are...! I'm asking, why're they making you dress up like that...!?\r\nYomi: That's what I'd like to know.\r\nAkira: Yeah, I guess... The bureau does say to do some ridiculous stuff sometimes, huh.\r\nAkira: ...Well, do what you can. Whatever you're buying here'll be my treat.\r\nYomi: Then, I'll have some tea. The black tea here is fairly good; it goes well with sweet foods.\r\nAkira: I'll have the same thing you're drinking then.\r\nAkira: Ah, when you get the photos back, lemme see. Those'll be fun to look through for sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Valkyrie - Yomi: End]: This One is My Favorite\r\n\r\nAkira: Yo! It's rare for you to call me to hang out.\r\nYomi: I got the photos back from that photo shoot we spoke about the other day.\r\nYomi: I think they'll be published online soon, but I had heard you were coming by on an assignment.\r\nAkira: Cool; let me just put my bike away. Wait here a minute.\r\n\r\nAkira: So, how'd that photo shoot turn out anyway?\r\nYomi: Like this.\r\nAkira: Whoa-!? The hell... You're looking way too cool in this.\r\nAkira: That sharp look on your face is great. It came out really damn nice.\r\nYomi: I didn't expect you to praise it so much.\r\nAkira: Why not? Of course I would if it turned out this good.\r\nYomi: That's true. Though, I expected you to make fun of me.\r\nAkira: Yeah, if I'm being honest, I was planning to, until I actually saw this. This whole valkyrie thing came out of nowhere.\r\nAkira: But this seems like it'll get some attention. Especially if Tsubakuro Yume and Kanami and the others are doing it.\r\nAkira: You got any other shots of you in this?\r\nYomi: No. This is the only one I brought with me.\r\nAkira: That's too bad. I really like the look of this one.\r\nYomi: I see. I wasn't sure which photo to bring myself, so the others in the special defense team picked it out for me.\r\nAkira: Huh. Didn't think you were so close with them, Yomi.\r\nAkira: Does that mean you're pushing omusubi on them too?\r\nYomi: Sometimes... I do.\r\nAkira: The omusubi you make are weirdly good, y'know. Somehow, just talking about them made me hungry.\r\nAkira: I'm thinking of getting something to eat here, but, what about you?\r\nYomi: I'd like to join you, but I've already made plans.\r\nAkira: With the special defense team?\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nAkira: Guess there's no helping that. We didn't get to see each other much, but I had fun today.\r\nYomi: I did too. Then, until next time.\r\nAkira: She's working real hard for her buddies, huh.\r\nAkira: Alright... I've gotta stick to it too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/A4RipDwmT9Y\r\n[Misogi - Kaoru: Start]: A Little About the Past\r\n\r\nKaoru: Today's kinda hot, isn't it-...

Or at least, I'd want to, but, if you ran out of yours, that'd be bad too.\r\nEllen: Should we make a trip back to town then? We'd be losing a lot of time though.\r\nChie: Ellen-san, Kaoru-san. It's alright. I brought lots of drinks with me.\r\nEllen: Chie, thank you so much!\r\nKaoru: It's nice somebody came prepared. You really saved us. [gulp gulp]... Phwah. Can't thank you enough.\r\nChie: It's just a part of me acting as everyone's onee-san.\r\nEllen: Have you been an onee-san ever since you were a little girl, Chie?\r\nChie: When I was little, I spent most of my time together with Mihono-chan, so it's true that back then I wanted to try hard to act as an onee-san.\r\nChie: Though I'm not sure it went too well at first.\r\nKaoru: Well, there's no way you could've been the same as a kid. But we all depend on you the way you are now.\r\nEllen: That's right; Chie's our reliable onee-san.\r\nEllen: By the way, I've never really asked you about it before, Kaoru, but, what were you like as a little girl?\r\nChie: Ah, I'd like to hear about that too.\r\nKaoru: Give me a break...\r\nEllen: Don't be like that. Do it for meee.\r\nNene: Nenenene~. Ne~ne.\r\nChie: Nene-chan's asking for it too, see?\r\nKaoru: Kh... Letting her hold you like that; you're totally on her side now...\r\nKaoru: I'll tell you about it, but it's not all that interesting, okay?\r\nEllen: I don't believe that for a minute, Kaoru! I have a feeling this'll be very interesting!\r\nKaoru: Anyway, when I was little, I was a real brat. I used to play with kids around the neighborhood, and I sorta ended up in the position of leading them around.\r\nChie: That's a little unexpected.\r\nKaoru: It just sort of happened after I'd stand up for the ones who got left out or got messed with.\r\nKaoru: Maybe it's cause I was hooked on the heroes you'd see in tokusatsu shows-.\r\nNene: Nene!\r\nEllen: You still like tokusatsu heroes now too, don't you, Kaoru-. Did aim towards becoming a toji ever since back then?\r\nKaoru: I guess-. I know you know, but the Mashikos are a toji family, so my mom and grandma were both toji too. I respected it because of that, or maybe looked up to it.\r\nKaoru: Becoming a toji meant you got to defeat aradama, after all.\r\nEllen: What else were you like?\r\nKaoru: What else-; when I was a kid, I played with my grandpa a lot too. I always felt at ease being around him.\r\nEllen: Since I love my grandpa too, that makes us the same~.\r\nChie: I'd imagine you always got along with Nene-chan too, right?\r\nNene: Ne!\r\nKaoru: About Nene...\r\nEllen: Before we can talk about that, it looks like we've got work to do.

I don't want him to get hurt anymore.\r\nKaoru: All the more because, in the past, I hurt Nene once...\r\nChie: Eh...?\r\nEllen: Something like that happened between you and Nene...?\r\nKaoru: I told you before, I looked up to toji. But, there was also a time I didn't want to be a Mashiko toji.\r\nKaoru: I'm not proud of it, but that was my rebellious phase.\r\nKaoru: ...I didn't want to work as a toji who killed aradama, so I hated it.\r\nKaoru: But, since I was a girl from the Mashiko family... There's no way I could just not be one. It's not like I could go against Grandma and everybody.\r\nKaoru: ...So I got way too fed up with it and started lashing out.\r\nKaoru: ...Seeing me taking my anger out on stuff, Nene came and tried to calm me down... I hit him by mistake.\r\nKaoru: And... really hard, too...\r\nChie: That's...\r\nEllen: Kaoru...\r\nNene: ......\r\nKaoru: If people won't get hurt, wouldn't it be fine to let aradama be around?\r\nKaoru: I want to make the world a place where nobody hates aradama, including this guy here.\r\nEllen: I see. I completely agree with that viewpoint of yours, Kaoru!\r\nChie: A world where neither aradama or people hurt each other... I'd like that to be a reality someday.\r\nEllen: And, as a symbol of that, when the time comes, let's make an Aradama Park!\r\nChie: Eh?\r\nKaoru: Kuku... Now there's an idea. We can quit being toji and kick back and relax at Aradama Park.\r\nChie: I smell trouble brewing...\r\nNene: ...Ne?\r\nKaoru: Oh, you're up? You overslept a little, but I'll forgive you this once.\r\nNene: Nee??\r\nKaoru: You're gonna be the park's main attraction, after all.

Everyone feels the same, right?\r\nSayaka: Mm, it's best if we go together.\r\nYume: If you and Sayaka-chan say so, then... I guess I have to!\r\nYume: I'll go along with you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: She Likes Omusubi\r\n\r\nYui: The casual expressions you get while traveling are the best!\r\nYui: Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan! Bring your faces even closer together... And, smile!\r\nYui: Now that's priceless!\r\nHiyori: ...I was just doing what she told us, but does this actually count as a casual expression?\r\nKanami: It's fine! Yui-chan, could you give me a copy of that picture?\r\nYui: Sure thing! I'll give you one too, Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: F-Fine...\r\nYui: Now, who should I take pictures of next~.\r\nHiyori: She just follows wherever her desires take her, doesn't she... Was it really a good idea giving her the camera?\r\nKanami: Ahaha.\r\nKanami: Oh, that reminds me, Yume-chan.\r\nYume: About what, Onee-san?\r\nKanami: Let's spar later on! We managed to get all these strong toji together, so it'd be a waste if we didn't.\r\nYume: I'll do it!\r\nYume: And not just with you, Chidori-onee-san, but with that onee-san too, and I wanna fight Sayaka-chan too.\r\nHiyori: I don't mind, if there's time.\r\nSayaka: Me either.\r\nYume: Great!\r\nYui: Ahhh, a group of smiling cuties is the best. Not good, my nose'll start bleeding...\r\nChie: Don't get yourself too worked up, Yui-chan.\r\nYui: Riiight, gonna plug up my nose with tissues.\r\nChie: That's not what I was talking about though... Honestly.\r\nChie: Ah, Yanase-san. While we have time, would you like to look over our schedule after we reach the hospital?\r\nMai: Sure, Chie-san.\r\nMai: You and I will be meeting to be greeted by the staff. Everyone else will go on ahead to the hospital...\r\nChie: It'll be helpful having you with me, Yanase-san.\r\nMai: I'll feel reassured having you there too, Chie-san.\r\nYui: This pair's looking good too! Seeing them so earnest together's the best!\r\nKaoru: ...Shut up, Yui-. Let me sleep in peace-.\r\nYui: Sorry about that-.\r\nKaoru: Seriously... [snooze].\r\nYui: Alright, I got a nice shot!\r\nMihono: (I can hear everybody all energetic like that, and yet...)\r\nYomi: ...\r\nMihono: (Why did I end up next to Satsuki-san!?)\r\nMihono: (I mean, that's fine and all! The problem is... How am I supposed to get Satsuki-san to lighten up and talk about something!?)\r\nYomi: ......\r\nMihono: (I can't just keep quiet; I've gotta try something... Where there's a will, there's a way!)\r\nMihono: I-It's cool that the two of us got chosen for Miss Five Traditions, wasn't it. I totally thought I wasn't going to get picked.\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nMihono: (Yes!? What's she even mean by \"Yes\"!?)\r\nMihono: (\"Yes it's cool that we got chosen?\" Or, \"Yes I didn't think I would get chosen either?\")\r\nYomi: ...\r\nMihono: (I can't tell anything from looking at her face...)\r\nMihono: E-Everybody sure is excited, huh!\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: (I-I'm already out of topics... No, I've still gotta keep the conversation going!)\r\nMihono: N-Nice, weather, huh...\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nMihono: (......Another \"Yes\"!? Help me, Kanami!! Let my thoughts reach you!)\r\nKanami: ...?\r\nMihono: (Kanami!)\r\nKanami: You look like you're having fun with Satsuki-san, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: (They didn't reach her at all!)\r\nMihono: Y-You think? We were just talking about what we liked...\r\nYomi: (We weren't talking about what we liked though...)\r\nYume: Yomi-onee-san likes omusubi.\r\nYume: Right?\r\nYomi: Omusubi are delicious.\r\nMihono: ...!?\r\nMihono: That's amazing, Tsubakuro-san! You got Satsuki-san to say something besides \"Yes\"!\r\nYomi: ? I can say things besides yes.\r\nMihono: Thanks, Tsubakuro-san! I think I might be able to get along with Satsuki-san now!\r\nYume: You're really thanking me a lot... What were you onee-sans talking about?\r\nYume: Weird, the train just stopped all of a sudden.\r\nYomi: There may have been some kind of trouble.\r\nChie: I'll check and see.\r\nChie: ............\r\nChie: Everyone! It seems like aradama have appeared in the area!\r\nYume: We can't move cause aradama are getting in the way? Then, all I have to do is beat those aradama!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: I Don't Really Like Hospitals\r\n\r\nMihono/Kanami: Everybody-! Hi-!\r\nKid 1: Wow! There's toji! Why? Why're toji here!?\r\nHiyori: We came here to visit you.\r\nKid 2: We saw you dancing and fighting on TV! It was really cool!\r\nKaoru: It doesn't feel too bad, getting a welcome like this. Guess we can do them a favor and show off a little.\r\nSayaka: Mm.\r\nNene: Nene!\r\nKid 1: ......\r\nNene: Ne?\r\nKid 1: This thing's cute!! Is it your pet, onee-san?\r\nKaoru: Well, something like that. You can go on and play with Nene.\r\nKid 1: Okay!\r\nSayaka: Kaoru, weren't you going to show off for them?\r\nKaoru: I lent them Nene, so that's already a huge favor, right?\r\nKid 2: Onee-san!\r\nKanami: What's up?\r\nKid 2: Onee-san, you were awesome when you were fighting!\r\nKanami: Thank you.\r\nKid 2: Where's the other onee-san who you were fighting with?\r\nKid 2: I want to tell her what it was like too!\r\nKid 1: I want to see you two fight again!\r\nKanami: Ahaha, now you've put us on the spot. What do you think, Yume-chan...\r\nKanami: Huh, she's not here.\r\nKanami: Satsuki-san, have you seen Yume-chan anywhere?\r\nYomi: If you're looking for Tsubakuro-san, she hasn't been with us since we arrived at the hospital.\r\nYomi: ...I will go search for her.\r\nKanami: Ah, then, I'll go with you.\r\nKid 2: ...You're leaving?\r\nKanami: As soon as we find Yume-chan, we'll be right back. Just wait for us.\r\nKid 2: Alright!\r\n\r\nKanami: She's not here either... Hmm, where could she have gone?\r\nYomi: Etou-san, I've located Tsubakuro-san. She seems to be in the hills behind here.\r\n\r\nYume: ...\r\nKanami: We found you, Yume-chan.\r\nYume: Ah, onee-sans...\r\nYume: I was hiding and everything too... But, since Yomi-onee-san's here, she must've found me out.\r\nYomi: I did.\r\nKanami: Everyone's waiting for you, Yume-chan! Can you come with us?\r\nYume: ......\r\nYume: I don't really like hospitals.\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYume: ......\r\nKanami: ? Why don't you like them?\r\nYume: ......\r\nYume: I'm not telling.\r\nYume: Anyway, why'd you even come out looking for me? Don't tell me... You were using me as an excuse to skip out?\r\nYume: Maybe I'll tell on both of you.\r\nKanami: Why are you only putting that on us!?\r\nYomi: We aren't skipping out.\r\nYomi: The children in the hospital said that they wanted to see you.\r\nYume: Why me?\r\nKanami: They said they saw the tournament on TV!\r\nYume: They saw how strong I was?\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nYomi: They also said that they wanted to see you fight with Etou-san again.\r\nYume: They did...?\r\nYume: Well, what else can I do. I'll go back then.\r\nKanami: Even though she just said she doesn't like hospitals... Satsuki-san, do you know something about that?\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYomi: I don't.\r\nYume: What're you waiting for, onee-sans! Let's hurry up and go!\r\nKanami: Okaaay!\r\nKanami: Let's go, Satsuki-san.\r\nYomi: Right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: We've Gotta Protect Them, Don't We!\r\n\r\nKanami: They're in this room, Yume-chan.\r\nYume: ...\r\nKanami: Yume-chan?\r\nYume: It's nothing.\r\nYume: C'mon, let's go!\r\nYomi: ...Right.\r\nChildren: Yume-onee-san!\r\nYume: ...\r\nKid 2: I-It's that Yume-onee-san!\r\nYume: H-Huh?\r\nKid 2: We watched the tournament! Yume-onee-san, you were so strong, and you really shined!\r\nYume: Th-Thanks...\r\nKid 2: I-I did it, I got to say it, Sayaka-onee-san!\r\nSayaka: That's good.\r\nKid 2: Yeah, Sayaka-onee-san!\r\nKid 1: Yume-onee-san, Kanami-onee-san, will you fight for us?\r\nYume: Do you really want to see us fight that bad?\r\nKid 1: Yeah!\r\nKid 2: I want to see!\r\nYume: Aha!\r\nYume: I guess we have to then! What do you think, Chidori-onee-san?\r\nKanami: I'm fine with doing it anytime anywhere.\r\nYume: Hey, I found the perfect place to fight too...\r\nEveryone: -!!\r\nKid 1: That sound is...\r\nChie: ...Don't worry, it'll be fine. Leave this to us onee-sans.\r\nChie: There's been an outbreak of aradama near here! We have to go!\r\nMai: Maybe we didn't finish off all the aradama when we were on the train...\r\nSayaka: We'll make sure to exorcise them this time. We can't let there be any victims here.\r\nKaoru: Nene, I'm leaving you in charge of keeping the kids safe.\r\nNene: Nene!\r\nKanami: We're going too, Hiyori-chan, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Yeah, Kanami!\r\nHiyori: ...I'd feel bad keeping these kids worrying for long. We'll exorcise them quick.\r\nYume: I'm here, so it's not like they have to be that worried. Right, Yomi-onee-san?\r\nYomi: That's true.\r\nKid 2: Yume-onee-san...\r\nYume: What? I want to get out there fast too.\r\nKid 2: P-Please do your best! But, please don't get hurt!\r\nYume: ...\r\nKid 1: We'll be cheering for you!\r\nYume: You don't have to worry so much. You all saw how strong I am, right?\r\nChildren: Yeah!\r\nYume: Then, just you wait.\r\nYume: ...I can beat up some aradama in no time.\r\n\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan, Hiyori-chan! Hit at the reinforcements coming!\r\nSayaka: Mm.\r\nHiyori: Leave it to us!\r\nChie: Kaoru-san! I don't think you're too used to working in tandem with me, but please back me up!\r\nKaoru: There's not much difference between you and Ellen, so don't worry about it! HAAAAAAAAAAAH!!\r\nChie: Not much difference between Ellen-san and I? ...So that's how much you trust me.\r\nKaoru: (That's not what I meant...)\r\nKaoru: (...But it's probably best I don't say anything.)\r\nMihono: Doesn't it feel kind of like there's more than when we were on the train? What should we do, Kanami?\r\nKanami: ......\r\nYume: What do we do...?\r\nYume: We're just gonna take them all out fast, of course!\r\nYume: Geez, there's way too many! What's up with this!\r\nYomi: ...\r\nYomi: There seems to be one aradama grouping all of them together.\r\nYomi: It's that aradama there, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Thanks, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYume: Everybody, I'm gonna beat that aradama, so I'm leaving the other ones to you!\r\nMai: ...That's probably our best bet.\r\nMai: Kanami-chan!\r\nKanami: Right!\r\nKanami: Yume-chan! I'll clear a path for you!\r\nYume: I'm strong enough, so it's not like I need it...\r\n\r\nKid 2: P-Please do your best! But, please don't get hurt!\r\n\r\nYume: But just this once, okay!\r\nKanami: Yume-chan!\r\nYume: What?\r\nKanami: It's fun crossing swords too, but...  It's nice getting to fight side by side like this, isn't it?\r\nYume: ...\r\nYume: Yeah!\r\nYume: Here I go, Onee-san! Those kids back there... We've gotta protect them, don't we!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: They Won't Forget About Me\r\n\r\nIn a certain room of the hospital--\r\n\r\nHospital Patient 1: The valkyries are back!\r\nHospital Patient 2: Thanks for always fighting off the aradama!\r\nHospital Patient 3: I'm feeling better already! We're fighting off illness too!\r\nMihono: Whoa, listen to those cheers!! It's sorta makes you blush, huh.\r\nChie: We don't often get chances to hear the voices of the people like this.\r\nMihono: Yeah! This alone makes me glad I got into the Miss Five Traditions competition!\r\nYui: Good! I just got a nice photo!\r\nSayaka: Yui. I want you to take one of me too.\r\nYui: Course I will! While we're at it, let's get Mai-chan and everyone in there too!\r\nMai: In that case, Sayaka-chan, can I get a picture with you?\r\nSayaka: Mm, I want to take one with everyone.\r\n\r\nElsewhere--\r\n\r\nChildren: Yume-onee-san, Kanami-onee-san, Yomi-onee-san, Hiyori-onee-san, Kaoru-onee-san!\r\nChildren: Thank you very much!\r\nKid 1: Hey, hey, who beat the most aradama?\r\nKanami: Hmm, who knows? Though, Yume-chan's the one who beat the strongest aradama.\r\nKid 2: That's amazing, Yume-onee-san!\r\nKid 3: Seriously!? Tell me all about it!\r\nYume: You want to hear more? But, that aradama really wasn't all that strong.\r\nYume: It was a piece of cake for me.\r\nKid 3: Ohh-! That's so cool!\r\nYomi: ...Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: What's up, Yomi-onee-san?\r\nYomi: ...I'm sure that these children won't forget your strength.\r\nYume: Even though they didn't actually see me fighting?\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nYomi: Even if the person who saved them doesn't remember... They still won't forget.\r\nYume: Hmm.\r\nYume: ...So these kids won't forget about me.\r\nKaoru: You did good too, Nene. You made sure to keep them safe, right?\r\nNene: Nene!\r\nKid 1: Ehh, did he though?\r\nNene: Ne!?\r\nKaoru: Oi oi, what were you doing-?\r\nNene: Nene! Nenene!\r\nHiyori: He's doing all he can to explain himself.\r\nKanami: Ahahaha!\r\nYume: ...Okay!\r\nYume: Onee-san, this isn't the time to be laughing, remember?\r\nKanami: Huh?\r\nYume: I mean, weren't we going to show them a sparring match?\r\nKid 1: Ah! About that, we don't need to see it after all!\r\nYume: Ehh, why not?\r\nKid 2: We all talked about it. How you'd be tired after beating the aradama, so we shouldn't make you.\r\nYume: You mean it? I was just thinking I wanted to show you though.\r\nKid 2: I really did want to see it, but...\r\nKid 2: How can I become a toji like you, Yume-onee-san!\r\nYume: You want to be a toji?\r\nKid 2: Yes!\r\nKanami: Do you look up to Yume? I'm sure you can be a super strong toji someday.\r\nKid 2: ...You mean it? Could I be as strong as Yume-onee-san?\r\nYume: There's no way you could be as strong as me.\r\nYume: I guess you could at least be as strong as those onee-sans though?\r\nKaoru: At least be as strong as us, huh-.\r\nHiyori: That'd make them a strong toji too.\r\nKid 2: ...I'll try my best!\r\nYume: ...\r\nYomi: Isn't that nice, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Yeah! Being Miss Five Traditions might actually be pretty fun!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/ZYwru7GiMV0\r\n[Valkyrie - Yomi: Start]: A Sudden Call from Akira\r\n\r\nAkira: Oiii, Yomi! Here, over here~.\r\nYomi: I could tell where you were without you having to shout.\r\nAkira: You just looked like you were kinda spacing out over there. Anyway, ready to go?\r\n\r\nYomi: I was wondering where you were taking me. A cakery?\r\nAkira: What's wrong with that? The limited run parfaits this place makes get a lot of talk for being good.\r\nYomi: You still like parfaits like you used to.\r\nYomi: So, what was the reason you called me here for?\r\nAkira: I had a little something to take care of around here. So I thought I'd give you a call. It's no fun eating by yourself, right?\r\nYomi: ......\r\nAkira: I know you've probably got a lot going on too, but you've gotta take a breather every now and then.\r\nYomi: I have to be part of a promotional photo shoot later today, so I can't stay here for very long.\r\nAkira: Huhh? What're you doing a photo shoot for?\r\nYomi: You could say it has to do with the results of the Miss Five Traditions competition that was held the other day, I suppose.\r\nAkira: Ahh, oh yeah, they put those out, huh.\r\nAkira: That reminds me, didn't you place pretty high yourself? I was surprised to hear it. I never thought you'd be up there.\r\nAkira: Though, it must be boring as hell to sit through some photo shoot cause of it.\r\nYomi: I can't neglect this, considering it's part of my duties as a toji.\r\nAkira: You got so straight laced. But, if that's what you're set on. You better do it right.\r\nAkira: You gonna be doing it in your uniform? They'd probably get mad if you wore something too casual; so a jacket like mine's out.\r\nYomi: You're probably right. Though, this time it's arranged for me to wear a valkyrie themed costume, along with Tsubakuro-san and the others.\r\nAkira: ......\r\nAkira: What're you talking about?\r\nYomi: You may not know about it, Akira, but valkyries were something that was part of Norse mythology--\r\nAkira: It's not like I don't know what valkyries are...! I'm asking, why're they making you dress up like that...!?\r\nYomi: That's what I'd like to know.\r\nAkira: Yeah, I guess... The bureau does say to do some ridiculous stuff sometimes, huh.\r\nAkira: ...Well, do what you can. Whatever you're buying here'll be my treat.\r\nYomi: Then, I'll have some tea. The black tea here is fairly good; it goes well with sweet foods.\r\nAkira: I'll have the same thing you're drinking then.\r\nAkira: Ah, when you get the photos back, lemme see. Those'll be fun to look through for sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Valkyrie - Yomi: End]: This One is My Favorite\r\n\r\nAkira: Yo! It's rare for you to call me to hang out.\r\nYomi: I got the photos back from that photo shoot we spoke about the other day.\r\nYomi: I think they'll be published online soon, but I had heard you were coming by on an assignment.\r\nAkira: Cool; let me just put my bike away. Wait here a minute.\r\n\r\nAkira: So, how'd that photo shoot turn out anyway?\r\nYomi: Like this.\r\nAkira: Whoa-!? The hell... You're looking way too cool in this.\r\nAkira: That sharp look on your face is great. It came out really damn nice.\r\nYomi: I didn't expect you to praise it so much.\r\nAkira: Why not? Of course I would if it turned out this good.\r\nYomi: That's true. Though, I expected you to make fun of me.\r\nAkira: Yeah, if I'm being honest, I was planning to, until I actually saw this. This whole valkyrie thing came out of nowhere.\r\nAkira: But this seems like it'll get some attention. Especially if Tsubakuro Yume and Kanami and the others are doing it.\r\nAkira: You got any other shots of you in this?\r\nYomi: No. This is the only one I brought with me.\r\nAkira: That's too bad. I really like the look of this one.\r\nYomi: I see. I wasn't sure which photo to bring myself, so the others in the special defense team picked it out for me.\r\nAkira: Huh. Didn't think you were so close with them, Yomi.\r\nAkira: Does that mean you're pushing omusubi on them too?\r\nYomi: Sometimes... I do.\r\nAkira: The omusubi you make are weirdly good, y'know. Somehow, just talking about them made me hungry.\r\nAkira: I'm thinking of getting something to eat here, but, what about you?\r\nYomi: I'd like to join you, but I've already made plans.\r\nAkira: With the special defense team?\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nAkira: Guess there's no helping that. We didn't get to see each other much, but I had fun today.\r\nYomi: I did too. Then, until next time.\r\nAkira: She's working real hard for her buddies, huh.\r\nAkira: Alright... I've gotta stick to it too."}, {"paste_key": "d4cA9Up5", "title": "5-3 That Name Is", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/d4cA9Up5", "timestamp": "", "hits": "108", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "1: Asakura and Atago\r\n\r\nMihono: Urgh... ghh...\r\nMihono: GAAAAAAHHHHH!\r\nMakoto: I've confirmed her power well enough. Let's stop it from rampanging. Any more and we could lose her.\r\nAkira: Yeah, I got it! Makocchan and Yuuki, you get back! I'll give Mihono a whack.\r\nYuuki: Understood! Please save Mihono-san!\r\nMakoto: Please do, Akira-chan.\r\nMihono: [pant... pant...] Akira-san... sorry, I went and... screwed this up...\r\nAkira: Just keep quiet. I'll get this over with quick.\r\nMihono: ...Right.\r\nAkira: ORAAAAAAAAA!!\r\n\r\nMihono: I'm sorry for causing all that trouble!\r\nMakoto: Have you managed to calm yourself\r\nMihono: Yeah, somehow...\r\nMakoto: I'm very sorry to have pushed you so far. I just had to see that power of yours with my own eyes.\r\nMihono: I don't... want Kiyomitsu to keep going berserk like that...\r\nMihono: ...Please tell me. About, why Kashuu Kiyomitsu is rampaging out of control... And, what I need to do to get a handle on it!\r\nMakoto: To start, I suppose I should speak of why I can tell you that in the first place... That is because the Hitakamis and the Asakuras are related by blood.\r\nMihono: By blood... Then, we're relatives!?\r\nMakoto: The Asakura family originates from the Atago family. What was once a branch of and aid to the Hitakami family.\r\nMihono: So like, my grandma was someone from the Atago family, and she married into the Asakura family?\r\nMakoto: No... Your grandmother was of the Asakura family. It was five hundred years ago that the Atago and Hitakami were together.\r\nMihono: Five hundred years!?\r\nMihono: Huh, but... I feel like I learned in makeup lessons that the Origami family only took over toji business for the country about four hundred years ago...\r\nMakoto: The title \"toji\" came into use four hundred years ago. Yet, there were okatana miko even before that.\r\nAkira: They only took charge four hundred years ago... So basically, that means okatana miko were going around unregulated before.\r\nMihono: I-I didn't know that...\r\nMakoto: Which is why, this is a story of five hundred years ago. A certain great aradama appeared in the lands the Hitakamis governed.\r\nMakoto: The ones who went to suppress it were those of the Hitakami and that branch family.\r\nMihono: The Atagos were a part of that?\r\nMakoto: It's said that the head of the Atago family led the suppression of the great aradama, wielding Kashuu Kiyomitsu and inspiring the other miko.\r\nYuuki: Did they manage to defeat that great aradama?\r\nMakoto: They did. The miko of the Atago family suppressed it. However, as a result, the rulers at the time began to regard the Atago family as a threat.\r\nMihono: They beat the great aradama, didn't they? So then, why'd they think they were a threat?\r\nMakoto: A hero with too much strength and too much fame is an obstacle to those in power.\r\nAkira: If they felt like it, they could take them out anytime... The people at the top'd only be scared of people like that. Even if the Atagos didn't have any plans on rebelling.\r\nMakoto: ...That was the case.\r\nMakoto: They took the head of the Hitakami family as hostage, so that the Atago family could not resist, and wiped out the bloodline.\r\nMihono: Wiped out!? B-But, I'm still here!\r\nMakoto: One daughter was able to escape in secret. And she was given Kashuu Kiyomitsu.\r\nMakoto: Having escaped, the girl abandoned the name Atago and took on the name Asakura, to conceal her background.\r\nMihono: And I'm... one of her descendants?\r\nMakoto: You are. The reason the Hitakami and Asakura are not associated was also out of consideration for their safety.\r\nMihono: Huh... That's crazy. I had no idea my ancestor went through a whole adventure like that... Wait?\r\nMihono: But, Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power never came up in that story, did it?\r\nMihono: My ancestor just suppressed the great aradama, but there wasn't any special powers... Huh?\r\nMihono: Then, this is...\r\nMakoto: ...Asakura-san. The phenomenon affecting you is not Kashuu Kiyomitsu rampaging.\r\nMakoto: That is the power of the great aradama the Atago family defeated five hundred years ago... Kanayamahime's power.\r\nMihono: !?\r\nMakoto: In order to suppress Kanayamahime, the miko of the Asakura family chose a method of sealing it within her own body.\r\nMakoto: Even now, after five hundred years, the firstborn daughters of the Atago... of the Asakura family have inherited Kanayamahime, generation after generation, sealed within themselves.\r\nMihono: There's a great aradama... inside me...?\r\nMakoto: One day, you may find yourself on the same path as Origami Yukari once took...\r\nMihono: B-But, there's no great aradama taking control of me or anything...!\r\nMakoto: It would happen in time. Neither Origami Yukari nor Juujou Hiyori were able to control it.\r\nMihono: But, the Asakuras have always been inheriting Kanayamahime, haven't they!?\r\nMakoto: That is because Kanayamahime had been rendered inactive.\r\nMakoto: Though I'm unsure of the reason why... When it was passed on to you, Kanayamahime awakened.\r\nMihono: Then... I'm going to...\r\nMakoto: It's alright, Mihono-san. I will save you. Using all the power of the Hitakami family, I will uncover a means of controlling Kanayamahime.\r\nMakoto: Which is why... Asakura-san, will you please offer me your help? Would you assist me in experiments involving the fusion of aradama and toji?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Parting\r\n\r\nMakoto: Which is why... Asakura-san, will you please offer me your help? Would you assist me in experiments involving the fusion of aradama and toji?\r\nMihono: Experiments...? You don't mean... You want to get your hands on Kanayamahime, do you?\r\nMakoto: Far from it. At the time being, we have no interest in Kanayamahime.\r\nMakoto: What's needed at the moment is you yourself, Asakura Mihono-san.\r\nMakoto: You are exceptionally suited for a technology the former head of our Hitakami faction was researching: \"tamayori\".\r\nMihono: Tamayori...?\r\nMakoto: A technique to rapidly enhance a toji's capabilities by equipping their body with an aradama.\r\nMihono: Equipping their body with an aradama...? Can you really do that?\r\nMakoto: It is possible. However, with our current technological capacity, we would not be able to apply tamayori to all toji.\r\nMakoto: The only ones we are capable of performing tamayori on are a small few toji... We've come to understand that toji of bloodlines possessing the special properties to house an aradama are extraordinarily suitable for tamayori.\r\nMakoto: The Origami, the Hiiragi, and... the Atago are one of those.\r\nMakoto: This is why, just earlier, I had you bring out the power of Kanayamahime, to confirm you were a descendant of the Atagos.\r\nMakoto: Mihono-san. As a descendant of the Atagos, it's likely we could successfully conduct tamayori with you.\r\nMakoto: If you were to assist us with experiments in practical application, we could use the resulting data as a basis for improving our technologies, so that one day all toji might make use of tamayori...\r\nMakoto: And, if that were the case, I can assure you it would reduce the number of toji harmed in battle. To reduce casualties among toji... That is the desire of the Hitakami faction.\r\nMakoto: I beg of you, Mihono-san. Whatever may happen to you from here, we of the Hitakami faction will protect you.\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: (I think it's a good thing that they'll reduce the amount of toji getting hurt, and, if I help them, Makoto-san's saying she'll help me with Kanayamahime...)\r\nMihono: (There's nothing wrong with it. I shouldn't be hesitating so much about this... Just, something doesn't feel right... But, what...?)\r\n\r\nMirja: Yes. In that time, I would like to find more on Inago Akira, Hitakami Makoto, and, the other one...\r\nMihono: Yuuki. Toribane Yuuki.\r\nMirja: Toribane Yuuki, was it. I'm going to gather information on these three.\r\n\r\nMihono: (Oh yeah... Back then, Mirja-san seemed like she was suspicious of the Hitakamis...)\r\nMihono: (Maybe that's why I can't bring myself to trust them now...)\r\nMihono: (All the things she's been saying sound good, but, is it really all good...?)\r\nAkira: Mihono. I'm asking you too. Help Makocchan out with this.\r\nYuuki: Please. Mihono-san.\r\nMihono: ...I do want to help... but... You're hiding something, aren't you...? Something that would sound bad...\r\nMakoto: ......\r\nMakoto: I suppose that's right... It isn't fair of us not to disclose everything.\r\nMakoto: Tamayori allows an aradama to temporarily fuse with the flesh of a toji. And, even with someone as compatible for it as yourself, the possibility of failure isn't quite zero.\r\nMihono: ...And what happens if it fails?\r\nMakoto: ...The aradama becomes unable to be separated from the flesh.\r\nMihono: Eh...!?\r\n\r\n???: GRRRRRR...! \r\n\r\nMihono: Does that mean... That thing was from that experiment...?\r\nMakoto: It seems that you saw, Mihono-san...\r\nMihono: That's horrible, Hitakami-san! That's too awful!\r\nAkira: Don't get the wrong idea!! That wasn't something Makocchan did!\r\nMihono: Huh?\r\nAkira: Ever since before Makocchan became the head, there's been adults with loads of influence in the Hitakami faction.\r\nAkira: They've been looking down on Makocchan cause she's young, doing their own experiments with animals... No, I'm still just making it sound better.\r\nAkira: They're doing experiments with tamayori on Hitakami toji. What you saw, it could've been way worse...\r\nMihono: They're doing something that risky with toji...\r\nMakoto: ...My hands are not clean either.\r\nMakoto: If only I had the strength, intelligence, and charisma of Origami Yukari-sama, to take total control of my faction, none would have to suffer as they did.\r\nMakoto: As the leader of the Hitakami faction, I am to blame for my inexperience.\r\nYuuki: Makoto-nee-sama...\r\nMakoto: However, if you were to assist us, Mihono-san, and we were to perfect tamayori, we would be able to prevent any more from being victimized.\r\nMihono: ...Still... Still, I just can't do it after all! I can't help you!\r\nAkira: Mihono!\r\nMihono: I mean... Fusing with aradama, it makes me think of Myouga toji...!\r\nMihono: My friends were turned into Myouga toji, and what they went through was horrible!\r\nMihono: And, if that tamayori were to spread, and it failed on people...!\r\nMakoto: As we improve on our technology, the rate of success will rise.\r\nMihono: But, the chances of it failing are still above zero... Right...?\r\nMakoto: We aim to make it zero. And also...\r\nMakoto: You do need our assistance, in regards to Kanayamahime, don't you?\r\nMihono: ......!\r\nMihono: Even still, I can't help you! About Kanayamahime, if I work together with the investigation team, we can look for some way to deal with it!\r\nMakoto: ......\r\nMakoto: ...That is unfortunate.\r\nAkira/Yuuki: ...\r\nMakoto: It would have been best if you cooperated with us of your own volition.\r\nMakoto: However, we are in a position where we cannot afford to turn back. Even if it requires force, we will have your cooperation.\r\nMihono: Wha!?\r\nMakoto: Do not let her escape.\r\nMakoto: ...Inago. Toribane. Restrain Asakura Mihono.\r\nAkira: So it'd come to this... Sorry, Mihono.\r\nYuuki: I'm sorry, Mihono-san. But... Makoto-nee-sama is absolute.\r\nMihono: Were you planning this the whole time...? If I said no, you'd force me...?\r\nMakoto: We don't want to do anything unpleasant to you. Please just allow yourself to be captured.\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: No way. I'm never helping you with your experiments!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Mihono's Disappearance\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Ah, look at this, Kofuki-san! Yui-chan! This outfit is cute!\r\nKofuki: Hmm, well, it's alright. It's not my style, but I bet it'd look good on you, Kiyoka.\r\nYui: Yeah, yeah! Kiyoka-chan would look cute no matter what clothes she wears~!\r\nKiyoka: Maybe I should buy it...? But, there's a book coming out this month I want... Ah. This outfit seems like a nice fit for Hono-chan.\r\nKofuki: You sure? This here's more like what Mihocchi'd wear.\r\nKiyoka: That feels too agressive for her. Hono-chan would wear this!\r\nKofuki: Nah, it's definitely this!\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan, which do you think suits her better?\r\nKofuki: You think it's my one, right?\r\nKiyoka: Kofuki-san does have a great sense of style, but I'm not giving up on this!\r\nYui: Uhh... Kiyoka-chan's is adorable and cute, and Kofuki-san's is cool and spicy...\r\nYui: I can't choose one way or the other!\r\nKofuki: That's not gonna fly! Pick one of them!\r\nYui: Err, uhhh... I-In that case, what about if we come back again with Mihono-chan, then she tries on both...?\r\nKofuki: You've got a point. It'd be best if Mihocchi tried 'em on.\r\nYui: Right!?\r\nYui: And, Mihono-chan's been looking down lately, so, when she gets back, let's throw a big pajama party!\r\nKofuki: Then, whoever's outfit Mihocchi doesn't pick, that person's buying the snacks.\r\nKofuki: And you're picking one out too!\r\nYui: Roger-! Whoo~, my fantasies are at full throttle!\r\nKiyoka: How long was Hono-chan going to be on this assignment for again? I'll call her real quick.\r\n\r\nChie: What did you call me here to speak about, Mirja?\r\nMirja: I found something in my investigation of Hitakami Makoto.\r\nMirja: And... I decided it would be best to let you know before I informed Asakura Mihono.\r\nChie: ...Was there something about Makoto?\r\nMirja: Hitakami Makoto is presently the head of the Hitakami family, as well as top of Mokusa's Hitakami faction.\r\nChie: She became the head of her family...\r\nMirja: Yes. And also... Among Mokusa, the Hitakami faction is an especially extremist faction.\r\nChie: ...Makoto's is an extremist faction? That's... That has to be a joke...?\r\nMirja: If only it were just a joke.\r\nMirja: There is currently an investigation underway into the Hitakami faction, under Akane-sama's orders.\r\nChie: ......That can't be right...\r\nChie: S-Sorry, Mirja. My phone's ringing...\r\nMirja: No, it's alright. It's possible it's about a mission, so please check it.\r\nChie: Thank you... Eh?\r\nMirja: What is it?\r\nChie: It's from Kiyoka-chan, but... She says she can't get in touch with Mihono-chan.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: So you haven't been able to contact Asakura-san...\r\nChie: Kiyoka-chan, could you explain everything?\r\nKiyoka: Okay. It was a few hours ago when I noticed. It doesn't say she's read my messages, and my calls aren't getting through.\r\nChie: I tried too, but it was no use.\r\nTsugumi: I'll give it a try as well.\r\nTsugumi: ............\r\nTsugumi: You're right, she isn't picking up.\r\nChie: Mihono-chan was supposed to be on a mission since early this morning, wasn't she? Was anyone able to contact her during that time?\r\nMirja: It seems not.\r\nMirja: Under normal circumstances, being unable to contact someone for several hours would be nothing to panic over... But, Asakura Mihono's current sitaution is unstable.\r\nMirja: Even as we speak, Asakura Mihono could have gone rampant. Who was the last person to come in contact with Asakura Mihono?\r\nKofuki: That'd probably be me and her.\r\nKofuki: We were in her lab last night when she came in wanting to help dispose aradama. Right?\r\nTsugumi: Yes. And, that's when she recieved a message about a new mission. The location was in Tohoku. She had said she knew the toji she would be partnered with.\r\nMirja: (...A mission in Tohoku, along with toji she knows?)\r\nMirja: Did she say the names of those toji?\r\nKofuki: Nah, not that I remember hearing. What about you?\r\nTsugumi: I don't know either.\r\nMirja: ......\r\nChie: What is it, Mirja?\r\nMirja: The Hitakami faction's base of operations is in Tohoku.\r\nChie: -!! Let's look for more information on that mission!\r\n\r\nMirja: A request to supress aradama in Tohoku... Accompanying her were Inago Akira and Toribane Yuuki... What's more, the request was fulfilled, it says.\r\nMirja: From this, it seems reasonable to conclude that Asakura Mihono made contact with Hitakami Makoto.\r\nMirja: Which would mean, the reason we can't reach her by phone is because...\r\nKofuki: Hold it, don't just go pushing the conversation on your own. I mean, who's this, Hitakami Makoto? person anyway?\r\nMirja: I haven't finished explaining yet, have I.\r\nMirja: That's the name of the leader of the Hitakami faction... One of the factions espousing extremist ideals within Mokusa.\r\nYui: Um, when you say extremist, it's hard to get an idea of what... Are there any specific examples of what they're doing?\r\nMirja: The ideal they hold to is reducing the amount of harm suffered by toji, but they have stated they are willing to even make use of aradama to accomplish that.\r\nYui: Would that be like... Myouga?\r\nMirja: We can't disregard that possibility.\r\nChie: Would Makoto... Would Mokusa do something like that...\r\nKiyoka: Why would someone that dangerous be meeting with Hono-chan?\r\nMirja: The reason... must be linked to Kashuu Kiyomitsu going rampant. The Hitakami faction has already shown interest in Asakura Mihono before.\r\nMirja: ...This was my mistake. Asakura Mihono even came to speak with me about it, and yet... I should have given her a stronger warning.\r\nChie: It wasn't your fault alone, Mirja. If I hadn't said Makoto was a friend of mine...\r\nChie: And also, I should have kept Mihono-chan closer. I knew that Mihono-chan was feeling anxious too... I'm no good as an onee-san.\r\nKiyoka: Please save that kind of talk for after this is over.\r\nChie: ...Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan is with dangerous people, and we can't get ahold of her now, right?\r\nKiyoka: Then, there should only be one thing for us to do. Let's go to Tohoku! Let's go to Hono-chan!\r\nKofuki: For sure. It's a hundred times better than crying over it here.\r\nYui: I'm just a little bit annoyed she didn't ask for advice though.\r\nKiyoka: We can tell her all we have to complain about afterward.\r\nKofuki: And we can just make Mihocchi pay for the snacks at the pajama party.\r\nKiyoka: That sounds good! Then she can spill out all her worries to us!\r\nKofuki: And anyway, you're thinking way too hard about this. It's Mihocchi, remember? Might as well stay optimistic.\r\nKofuki: So quit looking like it's the end of the world, all of you.\r\nMirja: ...Shichinosato Kofuki is absolutely right.\r\nMirja: We can voice our regrets later, Setouchi Chie. Asakura Mihono is our priority now.\r\nChie: ...That's right; now's not the time to let it get us down. Let's head for Tohoku!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Following After Mihono\r\n\r\nMirja: Ban Tsugumi? This is Kitora.\r\nMirja: I've arrived at the location where aradama had appeared in the mission Asakura Mihono accepted.\r\nTsugumi: Any signs of Asakura-san?\r\nMirja: There are none. There are traces of fighting however, so the report that the mission had been completed seems accurate.\r\nTsugumi: Understood.\r\nTsugumi: I'll pull up a list of locations in the area where toji from the Hitakami faction might have gone. Please hang on a moment.\r\nTsugumi: ......There's a hit. Nearby, there is an estate belonging to the Hitakami family. I'll send you a map straight away.\r\nMirja: I've received it. Thank you very much.\r\nMirja: I see, this is within walking distance of here. It seems very likely Asakura Mihono is there now.\r\nTsugumi: Please go take a look there to start.\r\nTsugumi: I'll continue searching for other locations, in case that one doesn't turn up anything.\r\nMirja: Please do.\r\nYui: So we found out where Mihono-chan is! Okay, time to go rescue the princess!\r\nKofuki: What're you doing taking charge.\r\nYui: If Mihono-chan is somewhere where they're doing dangerous experiments, we can't just leave her on her own!\r\nMirja: Get a hold of yourself, Yamashiro Yui. We can't be certain that Asakura Mihono is in danger yet.\r\nMirja: On top of which, we cannot show hostility from the start. If we put them on guard, it will make achieving our goal more difficult.\r\nKofuki: You're sounding pretty heated yourself though.\r\nMirja: I am perfectly calm.\r\nMirja: However, we are already in enemy territory. These are only necessary precautions.\r\nMirja: Now then, let's move.\r\n\r\nHitakami Toji A: Stop right there!\r\nHitakami Toji A: This is private property of the Hitakami family! You won't be allowed to enter as you see fit!\r\nKofuki: Huh? What's their deal?\r\nHitakami Toji B: Makoto-sama has told us not to allow anyone near the estate!\r\nMirja: So Hitakami Makoto is here.\r\nKiyoka: Please let us through! We know that Hono-chan is in there!\r\nHitakami Toji A: We're telling you to back off and get out of here!\r\nChie: ...I'm a friend of Makoto's. Tell her that Setouchi Chie is here.\r\nHitakami Toji B: No need! Leave at once!\r\nYui: Hmm, feels like they're turning a deaf ear to us. What now?\r\nKofuki: What a pain in the ass. Just ignore 'em.\r\nChie: Ah, don't do that, Kofuki-chan!\r\nHitakami Toji A: -!!\r\nHitakami Toji B: You've entered the premises without permission. Then, words aren't enough!\r\nKofuki: Oi oi, you serious? I'm not into doing this with toji!\r\nMirja: Keep your guard up, Shichinosato Kofuki! Here they come!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Kiyoka's Strength\r\n\r\nMirja: This is it for you!\r\nHitakami Toji A: Gagh...\r\nHitakami Toji B: I'm so sorry, Makoto-sama...\r\nMirja: Take your time and sleep.\r\nHitakami Toji A: Kh... At least, I can do this...\r\nKofuki: Urgh, that's loud as hell!!\r\nMirja: They've activated the alarm...\r\nYui: Wh-Wh-Wh-What do we do!? If we stay here, people are going to come running, won't they!?\r\nMirja: Either way, there's no returning from this point. Have you made up your minds on this?\r\nChie: Made up my mind... To fight Mokusa and Makoto, in order to bring back Mihono-chan...\r\nKofuki: It's a little late to be asking; we already beat down two of 'em. It's all the same no matter how many more we take out.\r\nMirja: That's not something the main culprit should be saying.\r\nKofuki: They're the ones who pulled okatana on me first!\r\nChie: ...\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie. It may be Mokusa ahead of us, but they are also toji belonging to an extremist faction.\r\nChie: I know that... And... I was planning to resolve myself for this.\r\nChie: If it's to save Mihono-chan...\r\nKiyoka: Chie-san... Please don't force yourself! If it's hard for you, you don't have to fight!\r\nKiyoka: I'll be sure to keep you safe, Chie-san!! You can at least depend on me at times like this!!\r\nChie: Kiyoka-chan...\r\nKiyoka: Because of how honestly useless I can be, all I ever do is get protected by you.\r\nKiyoka: I'm afraid of aradama, and I hate fighting against other toji... And you've fought for me so many times because of that!\r\nHitakami Toji C: I've located the intruders!\r\nKiyoka: So now... HAAAAAAAAH!!\r\nHitakami Toji C: Grgh...\r\nKiyoka: When you can't fight, I'll fight for you! And then... we'll all bring Hono-chan back with us!\r\nChie: ...\r\nChie: (...Kiyoka-chan, before I knew it, you've become so strong, haven't you...)\r\nChie: This almost makes you seem like the onee-san here.\r\nHitakami Toji D: This way! They're over here!\r\nKiyoka: Another one! Chie-san, please step back!\r\nChie: ...No, there's no need for that.\r\nChie: HAAAHH!!\r\nHitakami Toji D: Gagh!!\r\nChie: With you trying so hard, there's no way I can stand back and do nothing.\r\nChie: We'll all bring Mihono-chan back together!\r\nKiyoka: Alright!\r\nMirja: It seems there's no need to worry about Setouchi Chie. Though... the Hitakami faction's security is stronger than I expected.\r\nChie: ...You're right about that. Their response to fighting against other toji is excessive.\r\nKiyoka: Does this alone mean that Hono-chan is in there?\r\nMirja: Or perhaps Kashuu Kiyomitsu... Either way, it seems Hitakami Makoto intends to draw Asakura Mihono within her base here.\r\nKofuki: Talking about it won't do any good. Basically, we've gotta hurry, right? Then we'd better keep going!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Mirja and Kofuki\r\n\r\nMirja: They're appearing one after another...!\r\nMirja: (Musumi Kiyoka and Yamashiro Yui are pushing the fight, with Setouchi Chie going around supporting them.)\r\nMirja: (In which case...!)\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki! You and I will respond to enemies approaching from the sides and rear!\r\nMirja: We'll start by holding off the enemies to the rear!\r\nKofuki: Guess we've gotta!\r\nHitakami Toji E: Urghh!!\r\nKofuki: Damnit, what a pain.\r\nKofuki: Anyway, Mirja, is it a good idea not asking them about Mihocchi?\r\nHitakami Toji E: Wh-Who'd tell you anything...\r\nKofuki: Oh, looks like this one knows something.\r\nMirja: That won't be necessary.\r\nMirja: Even supposing they do know anything, forcing them to talk would take too much effort, on top of which, we have no means of proving whether what they say is accurate.\r\nKofuki: Ahh... You're not wrong. So, in the end, searching the place ourselves is our best bet. This sucks-.\r\nKofuki: And anyway, why's it only toji here! If they're using aradama-chan, then send some of those out!\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki!!\r\nKofuki: I got it already!\r\nHitakami Toji F: How did you know where I was... You shouldn't have been able to see me...\r\nKofuki: Cause Mirja let me know where you were.\r\nHitakami Toji F: There wasn't any... sign of that...\r\nKofuki: ...Well I can't help it if I figured it out.\r\nMirja: Excellent work, Shichinosato Kofuki.\r\nKofuki: \"Excellent work,\" my ass! Don't make me do all the work! When we get back, you're paying up!\r\nMirja: I'm paying...?\r\nKofuki: We're planning a big party after Mihocchi gets back, so you're paying for it too.\r\nMirja: I'll keep that in mind.\r\nKofuki: Playing around with aradama-chan's the best way to get rid of worries. But, Mihocchi'd rather party with all of us, right?\r\nMirja: That's true.\r\nKofuki: So anyway, that's what we're doing!\r\nMirja: In that case, Setouchi Chie will need to finance it as well. She is the onee-san of our investigation team, after all.\r\nKofuki: Might as well. With a college student paying, I'm hoping to see some snacks we can't usually afford to get.\r\nHitakami Toji G: There you are!! How dare you do that to the others... You won't get away with this!\r\nKofuki: ...And here comes another one. Just how many have they got?\r\nMirja: (Just as Shichinosato Kofuki is saying, there are far too many of them. Just how many toji did they have on alert?)\r\nMirja: (They shouldn't have anticipated our coming. In which case... Who were these toji expecting?)\r\nMirja: There's little use in thinking it over now though.\r\nMirja: We'll take them all out! Stick with me!\r\nKofuki: Yeah, yeah! I got it already!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Yui's Determination\r\n\r\nYui: Nnn, we aren't getting any closer to the mansion, Kiyoka-chan. Just how big is this place?\r\nHitakami Toji H: I won't allow you to go any further!\r\nYui: Another one's here...!\r\nKiyoka: Leave her to me!\r\nKiyoka: HAAAAAAAA!!\r\nHitakami Toji H: Grgh!!\r\nYui: That only took you a second... You're amazing, Kiyoka-chan...\r\nKiyoka: It wasn't as easy as you make it sound. That girl now was strong.\r\nYui: Yeah. They just keep getting tougher, don't they? But, maybe that means we're getting closer?\r\nKiyoka: Up ahead, Hono-chan is...\r\nKiyoka: When I had to fight against you and Hana-san, it was really difficult for me...\r\nKiyoka: If Hono-chan became like that... I'd hate it.\r\nYui: ...That's for sure.\r\nYui: I'm, y'know, pretty shameless, but Hana-san is so serious... She told me she still doesn't know how she can face all of you.\r\nYui: If Mihono-chan ended up like that too... It'd be hard on her.\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan...\r\nYui: Cute girls look best with a smile! Anybody who'd upset that... That person's an enemy of mine.\r\nKiyoka: ...Yeah.\r\nYui: After we get Mihono-chan back, the three of us'll take a bath together, talk a bunch till we go to sleep, then all sleep together in the same bed!\r\nYui: And then, until morning... wrapped up in the scent of two fine maidens... Guhehe.\r\nKiyoka: ...You're thinking your desires out loud, you know?\r\nYui: Whoops, sorry about that.\r\nYui: But... I'm serious. About the two of us getting Mihono-chan back.\r\nKiyoka: I know that much.\r\nKiyoka: You don't ordinarily fight up at the front unless Mirja-san tells you to. But...\r\nKiyoka: That's not true today.\r\nYui: Huh?\r\nYui: ...Now that you mention it, maybe you're right?\r\nKiyoka: I'm the same way, so I could tell.\r\nYui: We're both doing something we're not used to, huh.

Mirja-san made sure to warn me and everything too...\r\nMihono: Lately, all I've been doing is causing trouble for everyone. Ever since then...\r\n\r\nMirja: You may not have intended it, but that was a clear disregard for orders.\r\n\r\nMihono: Maybe I let it get to my head...

Good work on your mission.\r\nKaoru: Getting R&R is something I specialize in, just as much as orders to wait on standby and break.\r\nKaoru: Actually, you guys haven't finished up the barbecue yet, have you?\r\nEllen: No problem. We still have plenty of ingredients left-. You and Nene can both eat your fill.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nKaoru: Ooh, you've got some pretty good meat here. You really went all out.\r\nEllen: That's the beef that Mihomiho brought. She said she used all her spending money!\r\nKaoru: Is that so.

Though, it's a little sad we couldn't have everyone from the investigation team come along to refresh themselves.\r\nMihono: We can't always get everyone together at once. There's missions to take care of.\r\nMihono: But Chii-nee and Mirja-san'll be coming, won't they?\r\nKiyoka: Yeah. And it seems like Ellen-san and one of Mirja-san's friends from Ayanokouji will be joining us tomorrow.\r\nKiyoka: It would be even better if Juujou-san, Kaoru-san, and Kofuki-san were coming too; then we could hold one of our meetings-.\r\nMihono: You get pretty excited, huh Kiyoka... About doing stuff for the Alliance.\r\nKiyoka: Mmhm! After all, it's a lot of fun, getting to talk about fashion and beauty topics with everyone.\r\nKiyoka: I like being able to chat a little when we're all together after a mission too.\r\nMihono: Ah, I sorta get what you mean!\r\nKiyoka: And also, it gives me an chance to talk more with Juujou-san.\r\nMihono: Do you and Juujou-san talk a lot? Ever since she joined the Alliance?\r\nKiyoka: I'd already started talking with her a little because of a book. I lent it to her just a bit before the tournament.\r\nKiyoka: Though, back then, Juujou-san sort of had this hard to approach feeling.\r\nKiyoka: But she isn't like that at all anymore lately. She texts me casually too.\r\nMihono: So that's how it is-.\r\nMihono: Juujou-san's pretty interesting once you talk to her, isn't she.\r\nKiyoka: Yeah. She has a kind of uniqueness to her. I think she's really nice.\r\nKiyoka: That's why, I wanted us to get closer, so I was hoping Juujou-san might come along to the barbecue.\r\nMihono: Since you go to school together, I'm sure you'll have a lot of other chances.\r\nKiyoka: That's true.\r\nMihono: Anyway, the meat that I'm bringing tomorrow is some really good stuff, so you should look forward to it-. I spent a lot of money on it-.\r\nKiyoka: You went that far... You're serious about this, aren't you, Hono-chan.\r\nMihono: I'm going all out to have a good time tomorrow!\r\nKiyoka: That reminds me, they say chicken meat is good for breast enhancement, but, do you think it's actually true-?\r\nKiyoka: There's rumors that it's all made up.\r\nMihono: I'm not sure? Though, the meat for tomorrow is beef!\r\nMihono: And I bet it's not going to lose to chicken!\r\nKiyoka: Well, I'm looking forward to trying your meat, Hono-chan!\r\nMihono: The weather forecast said it'd be sunny, so it'll be perfect for barbecuing!\r\nMihono: Ahh, I wish it were tomorrow already-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/rz2csa\r\n[Summer Uniform - Mihono: End]: Isn't Meat Best After All\r\n\r\nThe day of the barbecue--\r\n\r\nMihono: Okaaay, I think I'll grill up some meat!

I want to try grilling it myself!\r\nMihono: The barbecue boss should enjoy her own food!\r\nNao: Grilling it yourself is fun too, isn't it~.\r\nNao: Wait... When did I start letting the barbecue boss title slide...?\r\nMirja: It's the truth, so isn't it better this way?\r\nNao: Mirja, if you're going to be like that, I'm not giving you a taste of this perfect combination of baguettes al ajillo~.\r\nNao: Want some, Setouchi-san~?\r\nChie: It looks delicious; I think I will.\r\nMirja: Urgh... So your next strategy is to starve me out. I'll stop spreading the word of the barbecue boss...\r\n\r\nMihono: What should I do now~. Ah, skewers might be good!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan! Hold on a minute!\r\nMihono: Wawah!? Kiyoka!? Wh-What's up?\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, your meat was so tasty that we were forgetting something important!\r\nMihono: ...?\r\nKiyoka: Wasn't our plan to eat what Chie-san and the others were eating, to learn the trick to getting bigger?\r\nKiyoka: If we eat any more meat, we won't have room for anything else.\r\nMihono: Buttt... Everybody's eating meat, so maybe meat's the best thing to eat!\r\nKiyoka: That's...\r\nMihono: It's a good idea, right?\r\nKiyoka: I can't disagree with that...\r\nKiyoka: ...B-But, no. You almost got me, but, if meat is what we already have in common, then we have to try copying them with things besides meat!\r\nMihono: Ehh~... Ah, wait, hang on. Just the stuff I'm grilling right now then~... It'd be a waste otherwise!\r\nKiyoka: It's not good to waste food, is it.\r\nMihono: So you get it! Meat's definitely good for growing! Boobs are meat too, right!\r\nKiyoka: Then, let's quickly eat up the meat you're grilling now!\r\nMihono: Eh?\r\nKiyoka: Eat faster, Hono-chan... [chew chew].\r\nKiyoka: Mirja-san and Uraga-san are putting something on their baguettes now.\r\nMihono: Uh... Kiyoka? I think we should slow down and enjoy the taste a little more...\r\nKiyoka: Okay... It sure is tasty, huh!\r\nMihono: It's tasty, so let's eat it more slowly...\r\nKiyoka: We can't do that; if we don't eat fast, we won't be able to eat all the same foods.\r\nMihono: Kgh...\r\nMihono: A-Alright, Kiyoka! [chew chew]...!\r\nMihono: (Kiyoka... She's way too eager about Alliance stuff... I mean, sometimes she puts on too much pressure!)\r\nMihono: (All I wanted was to really savor the meat~!)\r\n\r\nChie: Fufu, look at Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan scarfing down the meat.\r\nChie: They must have really been excited for the barbecue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/sk4o2p\r\n[Summer Uniform - Hiyori: Start]: Getting Out of the Rain\r\n\r\nKanami: Uwah-!?

My umbrella's a little small, but do you want to try it?\r\nKanami: We're sharing an umbrella then?\r\nHiyori: Don't say stupid things.\r\nKanami: Hey, I was only joking. I'm checking online, so give me a minute.\r\nKanami: Ah, it looks like the rain clouds will clear up in a little bit. How about we wait here for a while?\r\nHiyori: The rainy season's supposed to be over, but we still get bad weather. Is that what they call returning rains?\r\nHiyori: Really, if only we'd get clear blue skies.\r\nKanami: Want to try making teru teru bouzu?\r\nHiyori: ...Better not. Aradama might get involved again.\r\nHiyori: Which reminds me...\r\nKanami: What is it?\r\nHiyori: Nothing; I just completely forgot... Mai was going on a date with somebody, wasn't she.\r\nKanami: Oh right, we talked about that.\r\nHiyori: You know who it was, right?\r\nKanami: Why me?\r\nHiyori: I didn't notice at the time, but... Your reaction back then showed you knew.\r\nHiyori: Was it with Sayaka?\r\nKanami: So you get curious about this kind of thing too, Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: Urgh... What's wrong with getting curious!? It's not like I wouldn't be interested...\r\nKanami: Ahaha, sorry.\r\nKanami: Anyway, it wasn't a date. We just made plans to go have a picnic that day.\r\nHiyori: It was with you?\r\nHiyori: Wait, that's right... So she made those natto onigiri for you...\r\nKanami: Those were really tasty, weren't they!\r\nHiyori: Yeah, they were good enough that I'd had three or four before I knew it...\r\nHiyori: Still, that clears up the whole mystery.\r\nKanami: I wouldn't call it enough to be a mystery... Oh, Hiyori-chan, the rain must've stopped at some point.\r\nHiyori: Nn? Ahh, you're right. Okay, let's go.\r\nKanami: Sure... Ah!?

Isn't it rare to see one where all seven colors are that clear?\r\nKanami: I'm gonna take a picture and show it to everyone!\r\nHiyori: Though you know... As soon as the rain stopped, you can feel the temperature going up.\r\nKanami: Summer's just about here. Ah, Mai-chan and Setouchi-san messaged me back!\r\nHiyori: That fast!? ...What'd they say?\r\nKanami: They wished we could see it together.\r\nKanami: And also, how long will we take shopping.\r\nHiyori: Tell them we were taking cover from the rain, so it'll be a while longer.\r\nKanami: Okay! ...I sent it.\r\nKanami: Ahh!?\r\nHiyori: What now!?\r\nKanami: They said they're cooking something new for picnics, and they want us to taste test it when we get back!\r\nHiyori: Those two are cooking up something new, huh... I can't wait to try it.\r\nKanami: Eating outside would make it a whole extra level tastier, wouldn't it.\r\nKanami: Ah, since we have time, it'd be nice to go camping too and not just picnicking!\r\nHiyori: Camping, huh. It would sure feel like summer.\r\nKanami: Then we could do a test of courage... Ah, fireworks would be good too!\r\nHiyori: It sounds like fun, but... If we're doing that, wouldn't we have to look for a different location?\r\nKanami: Ah, you're right; if we camp there it seems like there'd be too many bugs.\r\nHiyori: Yeah. It's not that we couldn't do it, but I'm sure we could find a better place to camp.\r\nHiyori: And also... The rainy season only just stopped. It'd be good to set camping aside and come up with plans.\r\nKanami: Good idea! Since it's the summer season, I want to go with everyone to see the sea or a festival!\r\nHiyori: The sea...\r\nHiyori: (I'd have to bring a swimsuit for that, wouldn't I... Kh!)\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: Ah, no, it's nothing.\r\nHiyori: You're right... The sea would be good too, wouldn't it...\r\nKanami: Yeah it would!\r\nHiyori: Heh.

Aren't you scared?\r\nMihono: I come out in the mountains at night for missions and training and stuff, so there's no way it'd be scary.\r\nKaoru: (When she says it all matter of factly like that, it makes me want to scare her...)\r\nKaoru: (...Alright.)\r\nKaoru: Then, since this is a test of courage and all, how about we tell ghost stories while we walk?\r\nMihono: Ghost stories?\r\nMihono: I'm fine with that, but... There's not really any ghost stories I know off the top of my head.\r\nKaoru: Don't worry about it. I've got the best ghost story to tell.\r\nMihono: Huh, you do!?

There's a Jizo statue, right?\t\t[Jizo is a deity that is a savior of souls and also a protector of travelers.

Then, this place really is...\r\nMihono: Eep!?\r\nKaoru: (Though, I'm making all of it up.)\r\nKaoru: There's a lot of paved roads up this mountain, see? Those are trails they made way back to let people pay a visits to the graveyard here.\r\nMihono: Th-That makes sense...\r\nKaoru: But, y'know, mountains come with a lot of trouble. Like... landslides and stuff.\r\nMihono: Th-Then...\r\nKaoru: Yeah. That's why they decided to move away from this graveyard. There was this really bad landslide... And, apparently, they couldn't even check on all the graves.\r\nMihono: ...[gulp].\r\nKaoru: ...Which means, some might've been left buried.

You want to go too, Yume?\r\nMayumi: Chiba-san, you're such a popular girl.\r\nYume: Nnn, that wouldn't be bad either, but...\r\nYume: Since this is supposed to be a dream, I wanna try doing something even more exciting!\r\nErika: Whoops, I got rejected. So, what kind of exciting things did you have in mind?\r\nYume: I want to use magic!\r\nYume: I know there's magic in the world you onee-sans come from, so maybe I can do it too here, since it's a dream!\r\nKanami: You're not giving up on that, huh, Yume.\r\nHonoka: If you could use magic, what sort of things would you like to do, Yume-chan?\r\nYume: Let me see... Maybe fly in the sky? That'd be fun for sure, and it'd probably feel good to fly wherever you want!\r\nMiyuki: Flight magic, then. In our world, provided you have enough magic power, we've shown that's a technique many magicians are capable of using.\r\nYume: You've flown in the sky before!?\r\nMiyuki: I have. My first experience with it was highly enjoyable, and I felt proud to be a part of it.\r\nYume: That's so cool-! I want to fly too!\r\nMihono: That's awesome! So you really can fly around in the sky-.\r\nYume: Since it's a dream, if you jumped down from one of the school windows or somewhere up high, maybe you'd start flying-?\r\nYume: So long as you decide that your ideal self should be able to fly around!\r\nMihono/Kanami: Ah-!?\r\nMaki: I was wondering what all the excitement was about... Yume... You can't know that for sure, so give it up.\r\nMaki: And, Asakura and Etou. Could you not look at her like she just came up with something genius?\r\nMihono/Kanami: Ahaha...\r\nYume: Ehh. It's okay if I'm just going to give it a try, right-?\r\nSuzuka: Yume. We may be within a dream, but you still feel pain here, don't you?\r\nSuzuka: I'm sure that Ban-san has prepared some sort of safety mechanism, but, if worse comes to worst, we can't be certain it won't have an effect on your body or mind.\r\nYume: Ehhh.\r\nHiyori: Flying in the air does sound incredible, but I think this dream has a lot of limitations to it.\r\nHiyori: Even if we wish for it, the aradama won't just up and vanish in an instant. ...[chomp]\r\nYume: What's that you've got there, Onee-san?\r\nHiyori: Chocolate mint ice cream... [chomp]\r\nShizuku: ...[chomp]. Though, I know the feeling of wanting to try something since it's a dream. The magic we use can't do everything, after all.\r\nYume: ...I don't really want to hear anything from you onee-sans while you're all satisfied eating your dream ice cream though-.\r\nHiyori: ...Ngh.\r\nMiyuki: Fufu, it seems she's struck a sore spot, Hiyori-san.\r\nYume: Yeah, yeah. I only wanted to try it a little bit too.\r\nMiyuki: You're just brimming with curiosity, aren't you, Yume-san.\r\nMiyuki: However, even if this dream may seem both real and fantastical, doesn't it seem difficult for anything out of a fairytale to appear, like a house made of candy?\r\nSuzuka: Yes. It's likely just as Shiba-san says; it's unlikely anything can happen that strays too far from our common sense of the world.\r\nMaki: That's how it is, Yume. You'll just have to live with it.\r\nYume: Grr--! Fine then! I'm not going to ask you onee-sans what to do anymore!\r\nKanami: Ah... Yume-chan!?\r\nMaki: Wait... Yume!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Chasing Yume\t\t[Like in the event's title, Yume isn't written in kanji here, so it could mean both Yume and dreams]\r\n\r\nMayumi: This here. It looks like Tsubakuro-san dropped it earlier. I think it's some sort of character keyring.\r\nKanami: That's the mascot character, Ichigo Daifuku Neko.\r\nHonoka: Ah, now that you mention it, it looks like it has a strawberry daifuku motif. It's cute...\r\nMaki: Yume really likes that character.\r\nMaki: Still... Yume completely blew her top back there.\r\nSuzuka: ...We'll have to think up something else besides simply searching for her.\r\nMaki: Even if we can't go as far as making her fly... So long as we had something else that'll make her happy.\r\nSuzuka: That's just it...\r\nSuzuka/Maki: ...!\r\nMiyuki: ?\r\nMaki: Sorry to ask you this so suddenly, but... Is there any way you could make Yume happy with your magic? Of course, if it's too difficult, I won't blame you for refusing.\r\nAngelina: You and Suzuka both seem strict on her, but actually... You're very sweet with that girl, aren't you?\r\nMaki: We have to give her a proper warning, but she is something like a little sister to us.\r\nMiyuki: I don't have anything specific in mind now, but, could we think on it a little?\r\nHonoka: You're doing so much for us, so I want to help too.\r\nMayumi: Let's pitch in for Tsubakuro-san's sake. If we're going to make her happy, we might as well give her a surprise that she can't help but smile with.\r\nSuzuka: Thank you, all of you. If you think of anything at all that you need, please ask us without hesitation.\r\nMaki: Then, Yomi and I will go looking for Yume.\r\nYomi: ...There's a possibility that Tsubakuro-san didn't give up on trying to fly, after all.\r\nKanami: I'll help look for Yume-chan too!\r\nMihono: Shidou-san, Satsuki-san. I'll go too!\r\nYomi: That would be a great help. Thank you very much.\r\nMaki: Then, let's move quick. I'd appreciate if you girls did what you could too.\r\nMayumi: Of course; you can count on us.\r\n\r\nYomi: ...If she's already left the school, we'll have to go outside.\r\nHiyori: I thought she might be on the roof or one of the upper floors, but couldn't find anything...\r\nYomi: Yes. I thought the same thing.\r\nYomi: Still, I didn't expect this. For you to help with the search.\r\nHiyori: I was looking where she might jump down. I'm just thinking, when I was talking to her, I should have chosen my words a bit more carefully.\r\nHiyori: Let's search elsewhere.\r\nYomi: Right. We should meet up with Shidou-san and the others for now.\r\n\r\nMaki: ...You didn't find anything either, Yomi?\r\nYomi: Unfortunately.\r\nMaki: I see. Then, we'll just have to take things slow and steady.\r\nErika: We're going to help you too.\r\nErika: Lina and I looked around this area earlier, but we didn't find her. She wasn't in her room or anything, was she?\r\nYomi: Thank you very much, both of you. Yes, I just checked there.\r\nAngelina: If we're going to find Yume, I'd like to have some kind of lead first. Do you have anything like that?\r\nMaki: Since she said she wanted to try flying before she ran out, it's possible she might try jumping from somewhere high...\r\nMaki: But, it is Yume we're talking about. She might've also completely dropped that and is doing something else now.\r\nAngelina: I suppose... All we can do now is ask around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: I Hope Today's Memories Remain\r\n\r\nMaki: Was Yume there!?\r\nKanami: Ah, Shidou-san!\r\nKanami: From what witnesses said, it looks like Yume-chan was at a souvenir shop around here.\r\nMihono: But, with this many people around... We can't find her!\r\nAngelina: It would be a real challenge looking for one person in this crowd. Can you still not reach her?\r\nYomi: She hasn't replied to phone calls or text messages.\r\nHiyori: Still, why is she at a tourist place right near Renpu?\r\nMaki: If Yume's given up on trying to fly, that's a relief, but we don't know what she's up to now.\r\nErika: It'd be weird to go sightseeing somewhere right next to where you usually stay too.\r\nAngelina: Maybe she's curious about finding differences between the dream world and the real world...?\r\nYomi: Who can say? Though, in Tsubakuro-san's case, I don't think that's very likely.\r\nMihono: What if she just came here to have fun?\r\nKanami: Over there; I see Yume-chan!\r\nYume: What did you onee-sans come here in a big group for?\r\nYume: Ah. Were you maybe gonna start doing something fun? If you were, then you should've told me first-.\r\nYomi: That's not it...\r\nYume: Then, what? Tell me!\r\nMaki: We only came out here to find you after you went running off. We weren't planning on doing anything else.\r\nYume: Ehh... All these people came just to look for me? Why...? Are you sure you weren't doing something else?\r\nErika: We were worried after you vanished all of a sudden. Especially Maki here. And, what did you come here for, Yume?\r\nYume: Heh hehh~. That's because-, this place is selling a limited edition Buddha version Ichigo Daifuku Neko purse!\r\nYume: I was suprised they were selling it in the dream! They haven't actually sold these for real yet.\r\nYomi: The truth is stranger than fiction... Would that mean that Tsubakuro-san's power of imagination overcame the dream?\r\nAngelina: You really do love that mascot character, don't you, Yume. Is it a daifuku, or a Buddha... I can't even tell.\r\nMaki: Nn? Suzuka's calling me.\r\nMaki: Yeah, we found her just now. Understood. We'll take Yume with us and head there.\r\nYume: Where are we going?\r\nMaki: I think you'll definitely find this interesting. Let's go.\r\n\r\nYume: Onee-sans, why'd you all come out here for? It doesn't look we're here to swim, and it's a little early, isn't it?\r\nMayumi: The truth is... Starting now, we're going to put on a quick show of how great magic is for you, Tsubakuro-san!\r\nYume: You mean it-!?\r\nMiyuki: Yes. Now then, Saegusa-senpai. Let's get started.\r\nYume: Yume: That's a really big round ball of... ice?\r\nMihono: That's crazy! I bet you could make shaved ice for hundreds of people with all that!\r\nMayumi: Now it's time for me to show my strengths. --Here goes!\r\nMayumi: I'll need your help too, Miyuki-san. I'm depending on you.\r\nMiyuki: Please count on me. --YAA!\r\nYume: Now they're chipping away at the big ice with little ice!? Hey, what're you making?\r\nAngelina: You'll just have to wait and see, Yume.\r\nYume: Whoaa-!\r\nShizuku: Now for the finishing touch. Honoka, you're up.\r\nHonoka: ...O-Okay! Just have to light up the finished ice sculpture... There.\r\nYume: You made a giant Ichigo Daifuku Neko out of ice!! Wow wow wow! It's all sparkling!\r\nMayumi: It took a little bit of time, but don't you think it turned out rather well?\r\nYume: Yeah! I've never seen one this big before!\r\nSuzuka: ...Even though it was on short term notice, the results are impressive.\r\nYume: Because of this big Ichigo Daifuku Neko, it sort of feels nice and cool... I know; can I take pictures?\r\nMiyuki: Of course.\r\nMirja: We hurried over after Asakura Mihono called us, but this truly is an incredible sight.\r\nKiyoka: Right. I didn't think it would be so elaborately made.\r\nYui: I'm going to take some pictures of the ice sculpture with Mayumi-san and everyone, to commemorate!\r\nKiyoka: You're just using the ice sculpture as an excuse to take their pictures, aren't you...?\r\nYume: ~ ~.\r\nYui: ~ ~.\r\nErika: They seem really happy with it.\r\nMayumi: It was worth going to the effort.\r\nYui: Thank you as well, Mitsui-san.\r\nHonoka: This much was nothing at all. It's easy for me to keep it going long enough for Yume-chan to enjoy herself taking photos.\r\nYume: Ah... But, when we wake up from the dream, these pictures won't be there anymore, will they. I wish they'd be there forever-.\r\nMiyuki: Even so, if we believe they will remain, that might just end up being the case.\r\nKanami: Miyuki-san's right. Since we're all here, we should take a group photo of everyone in front of the ice sculpture.\r\nMayumi: That's a great idea, Etou-san! How about that, Tsubakuro-san?\r\nYume: I'm totally okay with it-. But, who's going to take the picture?\r\nYui: I'll take care of it!\r\nYui: Go on; everybody bunch up in front of the ice sculpture-. Honoka-san, if I could get you to move a little too please-. I want to capture you in all your glory-!\r\nHonoka: Okay, I got it.\r\nYui: If you could get up against the other girls... Just squeeeze yourself right up against them!\r\nHonoka: Ehhhhhh!? S-Squeeze against them!?\r\nMirja: Feel free to disregard her comment just now.\r\nMaki: Isn't this great, Yume.\r\nYume: Yeah! Thanks, all you onee-sans!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/px59ch\r\n[Mahouka - Suzuka: Start]: Erika's Single Day Experience\r\n\r\nErika: Hey hey, Suzuka. What do you normally do?\r\nSuzuka: What I... normally do?\r\nErika: Yeah, like, most days.\r\nErika: You and Maki, you aren't students of the Five Traditions like Mihono and them, are you?\r\nSuzuka: To put it simply, our primary duty is acting as escorts for the head of the Origami family.\r\nSuzuka: Of course, that isn't all, and we are engaged in other forms of work...\r\nSuzuka: If you're curious, why not experience some of it for yourself?\r\nErika: For myself?\r\nErika: There's no way! Stuff like student council work just isn't my thing!\r\nSuzuka: This is different from a student council, so you'll do fine. So, could I ask you to join me throughout the day tomorrow?\r\nErika: ...Seriously?\r\n\r\nThe next day.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Now then, we'll begin our morning duties. Through the morning, we will be doing office work.\r\nErika: ...There's kind of some crazy stacks of papers here though.\r\nSuzuka: Those are the papers you and I will be processing. I've seen to it that you'll only have simple paperwork, so rest assured.\r\nErika: There's nothing assuring about this! I mean, isn't this much paperwork insane enough!\r\nSuzuka: It may seem that way when you're unused to it, but, after we get started, it will be over before you know it.\r\nErika: ...Is that how this goes?\r\nSuzuka: Yes, that's how it is.\r\nErika: Then... I'll give it a shot. I'm the one who didn't turn you down, after all.\r\n\r\nErika: ...There's a whole lot of aradama, aren't there.\r\nSuzuka: Today's reports are on the light side. There are plenty of times we get more than double this.\r\nErika: More than double!?\r\nErika: You're almost the same age as me, and Mihono and them are even younger... It must be rough.\r\nSuzuka: You don't need to feel pity for us. We chose this for ourselves.\r\nErika: You did, huh.\r\nSuzuka: That's right.\r\nSuzuka: My, it's that time already.\r\nErika: Finally-!\r\nSuzuka: Good work. We've taken care of most of the paperwork, Chiba-san.\r\nErika: Ah, you're right...\r\nSuzuka: See?

I think I'll feel more comfortable with that than paperwork.\r\nSuzuka: Then, let's get going.\r\n\r\nAradama: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nErika: HAAH!\r\nAradama: GUGYAA!?\r\nErika: Suzuka!\r\nSuzuka: Right!\r\nAradama: Oooooo...\r\nErika: Is that the last of them?\r\nSuzuka: ...Yes, the readings have vanished from my spectrum finder.\r\nErika: Hmmm, that wasn't even enough for a warmup. Here I thought I'd get to shake off the gloom from this morning.\r\nSuzuka: By the way, what style of swordfighting do you practice, Chiba-san? I don't recognize those movements...\r\nErika: It's the Chiba style, but that wouldn't exist in this world, does it?\r\nErika: Where we're from, over half the police force's Special Magical Assault Team graduated from the Chiba dojo. But you don't have a Special Magical Assault Team here either, right?\r\nSuzuka: We don't have that.\r\nSuzuka: It's not exactly a substitute, but we do have a Special Task Team affiliated with the National Police Agency's Special Sword Administration Bureau.\r\nSuzuka: That would be us toji.\r\nErika: Hmm, so that's how it is... Actually, why'd you ask about my style anyway?\r\nSuzuka: Your tenacity with a sword... I simply thought you could make a fine toji, Chiba-san.\r\nErika: ...\r\nErika: Thanks, Suzuka!\r\nSuzuka: KYAA!?\r\nSuzuka: P-Please don't grab onto of me out of the blue like that!\r\nErika: Sorry, sorry! But, that made me happy.\r\nSuzuka: Sigh, you're a hopeless person, aren't you.\r\nSuzuka: Moving on, let's head to the next site.\r\nErika: Ah, oh yeah.

A wedding dress!?\r\nTsugumi: This is one of those so-called undercover investigations.

Well, it's not as if I don't think you're cute, you know?\r\nKofuki: Still, you seriously think a wedding dress is the kind of thing I should wear?\r\nTsugumi: Yes... Or, don't you think you might be unexpectedly suited for it?\r\nKofuki: Quit just saying that!\r\nTsugumi: We'll never come to an agreement like this... There's no helping it. Should we decide this with a competition?\r\nKofuki: Fine by me? It'll be whoever takes out the most aradama-chan. Loser gets the wedding dress.\r\nTsugumi: Out of the question. I would have an overwhelming disadvantage in that. Let's decide this fairly.\r\nKofuki: Like how?\r\nTsugumi: In speed-eating. I have lots of pre-made food here.\r\nKofuki: What part of that's fair!?

I'll give it a go.\r\nMihono: Wait for me, Chii-nee! I'm going too!\r\nYui: Ah, I'll just, go in later, okay-?\r\nYui: ..................Alright!\r\nYui: [pant pant pant pant]! In my hands, I've got Chie-san's clothes!\r\nYui: I never thought this plan would go so smoothly...!\r\nYui: This is what Chie-san's clothes feel like... Like grabbing onto thin air... What about the smell...!\r\nYui: There's no smell!!\r\nYui: What's going on here, Tsugumi-san!?\r\nTsugumi: Even VR has its limits. We can't reproduce the sense of touch and smell.\r\nYui: The limits of science...!\r\nKiyoka: ...You really were thinking up something weird.\r\nYui: Tsugumi-san! We need to reproduce the sense of smell next!\r\nTsugumi: For that, we'd need to acquire a sample of Setouchi-san's natural body odor.\r\nYui: Chie-san! Let me get a sample of your body odor!\r\nChie: Yui-chan, I'm giving you a lecture after this is over, okay?\r\nYui: I'll take the lecture, so just let me sample it!!\r\nChie: That's a no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/sn9k1d\r\n[Mahouka - Minato: Start]: Three Lost People\r\n\r\nHonoka: Heeeey! Kanami-? Mihono-?\r\nHonoka: ............\r\nHonoka: Nnnn, they're not answering, Shizuku.\r\nShizuku: Yep. There's no mistaking it.\r\nShizuku: We're lost.\r\nHonoka: Of course we are... Sigh. And just when they were finally able to take us out sightseeing...\r\nShizuku: We probably weren't separated that far from them. We should meet up again soon.\r\nHonoka: Yeah, you're right... Okay! Let's look for them!\r\n???: Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear you. You're lost, right?\r\n???: If it's alright, want me to help you look?\r\nHonoka: Are you sure? Umm, you're...?\r\nShizuku: Who are you?\r\nMinato: Me?\r\nMinato: Actually, I'm lost too. I came here with two friends of mine, but somehow I got stuck on my own.\r\nHonoka: Oh, I see. Since you have an okatana, you must be a toji... Wait? Isn't that okatana...?\r\nMinato: What, Chidori?\r\nShizuku: Someone we know has the same okatana.\r\nMinato: Someone you know...?\r\nMinato: You sure you're not mixing it up? Chidori's my okatana.\r\nHonoka: Really? But, maybe there's another one of that okatana...\r\nMinato: There isn't one.\r\nHonoka: Huh?\r\nShizuku: Honoka. We must just be just mistaken.\r\nHonoka: ...That's probably it, Shizuku.\r\nMinato: ...Hey, what's this girl like? The one you think has Chidori.\r\nHonoka: Umm... She's bright and cheery... Ah, she kind of feels a bit like you.\r\nMinato: Hmm...\r\nMinato: Alright. In that case, like I said before, I'll help you look for them. I want to meet this girl too.\r\nShizuku: You sure?\r\nMinato: Sure thing!\r\nHonoka: But, you're lost too, aren't you?\r\nMinato: I'll be fine. I figure I'll see my friends soon enough, and we might run into them when we're looking for your friends too.\r\nHonoka: I got it. Then, let's search together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mahouka - Minato: End]: Ideal Dream\r\n\r\nMinato: Hmmm, we aren't finding anybody.\r\nHonoka: You're not wrong...\r\nHonoka: We've been looking for a while now, but, where could they have gone...\r\nShizuku: Honoka.\r\nHonoka: What is it, Shizuku?\r\nShizuku: The koi are swimming up. Do you think they want food?\r\nHonoka: What do koi eat, anyway?\r\nMinato: Koi are omnivores, so they'll eat anything.\r\nMinato: ...By the way, I've never seen your uniforms before. Where's it from?\r\nMinato: It's not a school from around here, right?\r\nShizuku: It's the National Magic University Affiliated First High School.\r\nHonoka: Sh-Shizuku!? Was it really alright telling her?\r\nShizuku: We already told Mihono and the others, so why bother now.\r\nHonoka: Ah... You have a point.\r\nMinato: ...Magic?\r\nHonoka: Yes, though you might not believe us...\r\nMinato: ...Well yeah, I'm honestly not sure I believe you.\r\nShizuku: But, it's true. This world is a dream, and Honoka and I come from a different world.\r\nMinato: ...A dream?\r\nShizuku: That's right.\r\nMinato: A dream... Wait, but... Then, is that what's going on?\r\nHonoka: Is what...?\r\nMinato: You said you knew somebody who has Chidori, right?\r\nHonoka: Ah, yes.\r\nMinato: Then, maybe that's the real one.\r\nHonoka: What do you mean by that...?\r\nMinato: I'm saying, I'm pretty sure mine's just a dream.\r\nShizuku: What are you saying, all of a sudden?\r\n???: Minato-senpai! Where are you-?\r\nMinato: Ah, looks like I found a friend of mine. Then, seeya.\r\nMinato: I think you'll definitely run into yours soon too.\r\nHonoka: Um, what was your name...\r\nHonoka: ...She's already gone.\r\nMihono: Honoka-saaan!

Ordinarily, I would have wanted Mari and A-chan to come too.\r\nKitayama Shizuku: We don't get school trips at Magic High, so it does get hard for us to stay the night anywhere outside of chances like this.\r\nAngelina: They really make the school curriculum packed, don't they.\r\nChiba Erika: Yeah they do. That's why you shouldn't let it get to you, senpai.\r\nShizuku: You would have preferred it if Tatsuya could come along, wouldn't you, Miyuki?\r\nShiba Miyuki: Going on a trip together with Onii-sama would be all I could ask for, but I'm sure that's not what Saegusa-senpai had in mind.\r\nMiyuki: And, when I told Onii-sama about this, he said not to mind him and enjoy myself.\r\nErika: Tatsuya-kun seems like he'd come running in an instant if anything went wrong anyway-.\r\nMiyuki: Yes, that's how Onii-sama is. Though, we should try to avoid letting anything that worrisome happen.\r\nMayumi: I'm so glad that you're all looking forward to it. Ah, if any of you can't sleep with a different pillow, don't forget to bring your own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/0seagv\r\nCountdown: Sleepover Part 2\r\n\r\nHonoka: Oh right, Shizuku. You said before you were looking something up to prepare for tonight; what was it?\r\nShizuku: It's almost summer, so I was thinking we could tell scary stories.\r\nHonoka: We finally get the chance to stay the night together, so I think it'd be better to talk about something else... Something besides scary stories!\r\nMiyuki: What sort of conversations would be appropriate for this then?\r\nMayumi: Talking about romance, right?\r\nErika: Is there someone you're interested in, Saegusa-senpai?\r\nMayumi: That stays a secret~.\r\nShizuku: I have a feeling Honoka's gaining more rivals.\r\nHonoka: Hey, Shizuku! Just because Tatsuya-san's so charming doesn't make us rivals...\r\nAngelina: You really do like Tatsuya, huh Honoka.\r\nMayumi: Fufu, you'll have to tell us all about it tonight, okay?\r\nHonoka: Auuu~...\r\nMiyuki: By the way, what scary stories did you find, Shizuku?\r\nShizuku: What's been popular lately aren't really scary stories, but strange stories. Whether or not it really happened, there's stories of people suddenly going to a parallel world.\r\nErika: Those are nothing more than people just making stuff up.\r\nMiyuki: Though, they do sound interesting. If you'd like, you can tell me about it later.\r\nShizuku: I wasn't expecting you to be interested, but alright. Wait till tonight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1: The Ultimate Image Training\r\n\r\nMihono: Hey, Fukki. Do you know anything about this new training Tsugumi-san told us about?\r\nKofuki: Like I'd know. I only just heard we were doing training today.\r\nMirja: It seems we'll be testing a new training method. I was told we would learn the details once we arrive at the lab.\r\nKiyoka: By the way, Chie-san. Didn't you say you had something you needed to take care of after this?\r\nChie: I do. If the training takes more than a few hours, then I think I'll only stand in and watch.\r\nChie: Though, I don't mean to dissapoint Tsugumi-chan...\r\nYui: I think I heard there'll be people there besides the investigation team, so I'm sure it'll be alright, Chie-san.\r\nYui: What matters most is it'll be stacked with girls!\r\nMirja: ...We should hurry.\r\n\r\nKanami: Ah, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: So when they said there'd be people besides us, it was Kanami and Hiyori.\r\nYume: We're here too though-.\r\nMirja: I see. With this many people assembled, it should be a full-fledged test.\r\nTsugumi: Everyone. I see you're all here. Thank you very much for coming.\r\nTsugumi: Now, I'll get straight to the point. Speaking from what we would like to achieve, we are looking for a means of utilizing dreams for training purposes.\r\nMihono: By dreams, you mean like what we see while we're sleeping?\r\nTsugumi: Yes. Our chief objective is to carry out the ultimate image training efficiently through dreams while sleeping.\r\nTsugumi: It may sound dubious, but there are hypotheses and examples pointing to the link between experiences while dreaming and actual improvement of ability in the field of sports.\r\nTsugumi: During this test, I will have you at least sleep for a period of several hours.\r\nSuzuka: So this is an experiment to determine if holding onto the image of \"doing\" from within a dream can lead to improvement of actual technique.\r\nTsugumi: That's it exactly. What's most important is that you form the strongest... The greatest image of yourself.\r\nKanami: Training in your dreams! I think I might be really good at that!\r\nMihono: If it's in a dream, you'd be able to do all kinds of crazy stuff!\r\nHiyori: But, will you really be able to do it that easily?\r\nTsugumi: I will be giving each of you strong support so you can have the experience you want to see while sleeping.\r\nTsugumi: As for what your dream will be like... Please form a concrete image of your ideal self.\r\nKiyoka: Our ideal self... It's a little hard to, when you ask us all of a sudden.\r\nTsugumi: Well, so long as we can collect a variety of samples this time, that will be enough. It's not an issue if you're unable to see exactly the dreams you want, so I would appreciate it if you simply participated.\r\nYui: It's alright! I'll think up the ideal Kiyoka-chan for you!\r\nKiyoka: That's not alright at all, Yui-chan... Don't think up anything weird, okay?\r\nMihono: Hmmm... What would be good? I guess I want to be strong at least.\r\nYume: I'm already strong, so I'd want something else-.\r\nYume: Instead of my ideal self or whatever, since we'll be dreaming, don't you want to try using magic and stuff?\r\nKanami: Since we're dreaming, I bet we could!\r\nMihono: That'll be fun for sure! Fire and ice magic are pretty cliched, but I still wanna do them!\r\nYume: I know, right! I wanna try flying too!\r\nMaki: Magic is definitely out of the question here...\r\nMirja: Dreams... It may depend on your power of imagination, but, if you aren't able to build from that experience in the real world, it wouldn't be suitable for use as training...\r\nYume: Geez, why do you onee-sans have to make it so boring?\r\nTsugumi: Well-, I wasn't expecting magic either, but I think it could possibly work?\r\nTsugumi: Though, it doesn't suit the purpose of today's test. This is ultimately a form of training for toji.\r\nKanami: Right, yeah... Ahaha.\r\nYomi: Our ideal self as a toji... That might be a little difficult to imagine. Though, it isn't as if I don't have a strength that I idealize.\r\nSuzuka: Desires are something that will differ from person to person.\r\nSuzuka: But many toji would dream of suppressing aradama while keeping casualties to a minimum, or consider it their ideal.\r\nSuzuka: Though, wishing all the aradama were gone might be the most common.\r\nKofuki: Count me out if all the aradama-chan are gone.\r\nKiyoka: Ah, where are you going, Kofuki-san!?\r\nKofuki: I'm not interested in training where there's no aradama-chan.\r\nTsugumi: Don't worry. Shichinosato-san not participating was well within my expectations.\r\nChie: I have to take care of something later too, so I won't be able to participate in the training itself.\r\nChie: If there's anything I can help with instead, feel free to let me know.\r\nTsugumi: I would appreciate it. Then, those of you who will be participating, please come with me. We'll provide a comfortable environment for sleeping.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Please strongly visualize your ideal self. Do your best not to forget it.\r\nTsugumi: Now then, everyone, pleasant dreams--\r\n\r\nMihono: Tsugumi-san's training was over before you know it, but I feel like, right now, I can concentrate really hard on missions!\r\nMirja: This may be an especially effective training method for you, Asakura Mihono.\r\nYui: Since my okatana is an odachi, I thought I'd like to be able to decide things in a single hit when it counts, but that means I'll have to work on my actual ability to read a situation.\r\nYui: Since I realized that at least, does that mean the training worked?\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan's... getting very serious.\r\nYui: I am serious-. Since toji are girls, I've gotta protect them no matter what!\r\nHiyori: What did you end up thinking about, Kanami?\r\nKanami: You know, I get the feeling that I dreamed about fighting in a match against you and Yume-chan. You were both really strong!\r\nKanami: And fighting tough opponents is the best training after all, so I might've gotten closer to my ideal.\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nHiyori: Well, that might be one way to do it. Which means it might not be bad using that dream for training.\r\nKanami: Yeah!\r\nMihono: Ahaha, even in her dreams, Kanami still acts like Kanami-.\r\nMirja: One step at a time, we can only work toward our goals through effort. Holding onto a firm image will be a good experience--\r\nKiyoka: Aradama!?\r\nMirja: A message came in... It seems we've been given orders to move out.\r\nMirja: We'll hurry to the scene immediately!\r\n\r\nAradama: GGGGGIIIII...!\r\nChiba Erika: Come on already! What's with... these things!? This whole time... there's just no end to them!\r\nShiba Miyuki: Erika, complaining won't do any good. We may not be sure of what these strange things are, but we can't leave them here.\r\nMiyuki: --HAAAH!\r\nErika: Thanks, Miyuki! If they're like this--\r\nKitayama Shizuku: Miyuki's cooling magic stopped the monsters here from moving.\r\nMitsui Honoka: Thank goodness... Now we can catch our breath.\r\nSaegusa Mayumi: Still, what are these monstrous looking things in the first place...?\r\nAngelina:  Wait... Something's not right! No way; Miyuki's magic isn't working...?\r\nAradama: ...UUUUU!\r\nYui: It looks like there's some extra cute cuties fighting for some reason!?\r\nMihono: Eh; you're right!?\r\nKanami: We've gotta help them!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Strange Visitors\r\n\r\nMiyuki: Thank you very much for your assistance.\r\nHiyori: No, you don't need to thank us. Suppressing aradama is our duty.\r\nShizuku: So those monster looking things are called aradama.\r\nErika: What's the deal with our attacks not having any effect on them, anyway?\r\nKanami: Only a toji carrying an okatana can exorcise an aradama.\r\nErika: Ehh... What's with that? Is that a thing?\r\nMayumi: So that would be why Miyuki-san's magic didn't do any more than hold them still...\r\nMihono: ...M-Magic!? Can you really use magic!?\r\nHonoka: Ah, we can. We're students of Magic High School.\r\nKiyoka: ...Magic... high school?\r\nAngelina: It looks like... We both have lots of things we don't know about each other.\r\nMirja: Yes. That seems to be the case. I'd like to provide a better place for us to talk over the situation, so will you come with us?\r\nMayumi: We understand. Lead the way.\r\n\r\nMayumi: Then, summing it up, these aradama aren't only the ones from earlier, but something like a natural disaster which appears frequently...\r\nMayumi: The ones specialized to combat them are toji like yourselves, and people have been aware of both aradama and toji long throughout history.\r\nShizuku: ...Though, neither of them are common knowledge to us.\r\nHonoka: Yeah... But, why though... Maybe if we had Tatsuya-san here with us...\r\nMiyuki: That's right. I'm sure that, if Onii-sama were with us, he would diminish the unease we feel now.\r\nMiyuki: But, Onii-sama isn't here.\r\nMiyuki: Which is why we need to do all we can to return to the world with Onii-sama in it.\r\nMayumi: Miyuki-san has the right idea. Mm, it would be bad for us to lose hope here.\r\nAngelina: Well, knowing Tatsuya, he'll figure something out as soon as he learns something happened to Miyuki.\r\nErika: Ah, he totally would! Tatsuya-kun's a real siscon, after all-.\r\nMiyuki: Honestly... I don't need to hear that from you, Erika, Lina... Let's leave the talk about Onii-sama at that.\r\nMiyuki: Otherwise, we'd be inconveniencing everyone. They made time to meet with us here, after all.\r\nKanami: It sounds like your brother is really something else, uh, Miyuki-san?\r\nMiyuki: Yes, I'm very proud of him. Ah... I'm sorry. Please, continue what you were saying.\r\nYui: I know, I know! Mirja-san, I have a suggestion to make-!\r\nMirja: And what is that, Yamashiro Yui.\r\nYui: Shouldn't we introduce ourselves around now? It's awkward not knowing each other's names.\r\nErika: I'm on board with that! My name's Chiba Erika. It looks like we'll be in your care for a while, so treat us well~.\r\nYui: Pleased to meet you, Erika-san! I'm Yamashiro Yui!\r\nMihono: I'm Asakura Mihono.\r\nMihono: You might be worried, but I'm sure we can get a place to stay and stuff for you, so don't worry about it!\r\nMihono: ...Right?\r\nMirja: I contacted Shidou Maki earlier, and she's working to prepare dorm rooms for you all to live in.\r\nMayumi: My name is Saegusa Mayumi. Thank you very much for helping us here. We can't thank you enough for your kindness.\r\nMayumi: All of us attend the National Magic University Affiliated First High School. And also, I'm a third year, while the others are all first years.\r\nMayumi: I know. How about we all introduce ourselves first for now? I think it'll go more smoothly if we decide on an order like that.\r\nMiyuki: That makes sense. Then, I will go next. My name is Shiba Miyuki. It's a pleasure to meet you.\r\nAngelina: I'm Angelina Kudou Shields. It's sort of a mouthful, so I'd appreciate it if you just called me Lina.\r\nShizuku: Kitayama Shizuku. Nice to meet you. Come on, it's your turn, Honoka. Show them your magic while you introduce yourself.\r\nHonoko: Hey... Shizuku!? It's not like you did that during your turn...\r\nMiyuki: Wouldn't that be alright? So long as you control the power output, flash magic shouldn't be very dangerous to show off.\r\nHonoka: Not you too, Miyuki...\r\nHonoka: Sigh... Then, only a little. It's going to be bright, so please don't look directly at it.\r\nHonoka: ...This is the kind of magic I'm best at.\r\nHonoka: Ahh... That was nerve-wracking.\r\nMiyuki: Honoka. You forgot to tell them your name.\r\nHonoka: ...AH! I-I'm Mitsui Honoka... P-Pleased to meet you.\r\nHiyori: ...So there really is magic.\r\nYume: Wow-! I heard there were people who could use magic, so I came along.\r\nYume: That's awesome! You saw that just now, right, Maki-onee-san? Isn't that awesome?\r\nMaki: Yeah... It was pretty surprising. My eyes are still flashing.\r\nHonoka: I'm sorry about that.\r\nMaki: Nah, you don't have to worry about it. It's fine. I already got used to it. Anyway, it's true, huh.\r\nMirja: Now that Shidou Maki and the others have arrived, we can introduce ourselves. Those of us here now will likely be the ones supporting you too.\r\nMirja: My name is Kitora Mirja. It's good to meet you.\r\nMirja: Then, continuing on--\r\n\r\nMirja: Now, I'll summarize the information we've heard from you. If I make any mistakes, please point it out.\r\nMirja: It's difficult to believe, but... Firstly, magic seems to exist, and you are all from a world where people have established a system of technology based around it.\r\nMirja: It's also still possible for you to use that magic now.\r\nMirja: A major question remaining is, we don't understand why you have come to this world.\r\nMihono: Mirja-san! The biggest reason's gotta be magic! It's magic!\r\nYume: For sure-. I wanna see some more!\r\nMirja: I understand how you two feel. However, I was stating it from a problem-solving perspective.\r\nMirja: That reminds me, if Shidou Maki is here, is it wrong of me to assume you can provide these girls with a place to stay?\r\nMaki: Right... I wasn't sure how to respond to this at first, but I couldn't think of a reason you would lie like that.\r\nMaki: Like Kitora mentioned before, since we aren't sure how it is you came here, is it safe to say you don't currently know how to return to your own world either?\r\nMayumi: Yes. Unfortunately, you're correct that we don't know anything about our situation.\r\nSuzuka: It's going to take time then... We'll have to conduct an investigation.\r\nSuzuka: I'd like to have some sort of clue to start from, but you must be tired with all that's happened. Would you like some time to rest or something to eat?\r\nErika: Actually, I was just about starving, so I'd be really grateful for some food! And, while we eat, I want to hear more about you toji.\r\nKanami: We want to know more about magic too!\r\nYume/Mihono: Yeah yeah!\r\nSuzuka: Then, let's go with that. If any of you wish to rest in your rooms, say the word and I'll guide you straight there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: Looking for a Lead to Get Back Home\r\n\r\nKanami: You were more focused during that last mission that usual, right?\r\nMihono: Yeah! Maybe it worked out that Tsugumi-san's training gave me a kind of feeling to hold onto! I'll try my best to focus a little bit longer when we're fighting!\r\nKanami: I'm getting even more excited to spar with you~! We've gotta do it together again, for sure!\r\nMihono: I'm not gonna lose next time!\r\nYume: Huh? Are you onee-sans going to fight? Then, I wanna join in too! I can, can't I?\r\nKanami: We weren't doing it right now. Just making a promise to do it later.\r\nYume: Oh. Well that's lame-. We should just do it right away.\r\nSuzuka: Along with suppressing aradama, toji have various duties to attend to. In particular, Asakura-san has her business with the investigation team. She must be busy. And I'm sure she would want to fight when she can be at her best.\r\nKanami: What kind of ideal did you come up in the training the other day, Yume-chan?\r\nYume: Nnn, I don't think I really had one. They told us to imagine the strongest ideal of ourself, but I'm already super strong!\r\nMihono: ...That's Tsubakuro-san for you.\r\nMihono: Ah, Miyuki-san! What are you all doing here?\r\nMiyuki: Hello. We were just looking at the state of the town and the passerbys.\r\nYume: Why were you doing that?\r\nMiyuki: We were thinking, if we came to this world, it must have had other effects somewhere. But, we ran into a problem...\r\nShizuku: Since we only just got here, it's hard for us to tell if anything's off or different from before.\r\nSuzuka: I see. So that's what you were up to.\r\nMayumi: I'm sure you must be busy with your missions defeating aradama, but... Could you help us with this?\r\nKanami: I'm on it! If anything catches my eye, I'll let you know.\r\nSuzuka: Preparing personnel specifically to investigate strange occurences would be difficult, but, when there are gaps in my duties, I'll try organizing a system for people to make reports.\r\nMiyuki: Thank you very much.\r\nYume: Could you explain it more clearly so it'll be easier to find? Since you onee-sans can use magic, does that mean there'd be magic and stuff?\r\nHonoka: ...You say magic and stuff, but I don't think that's any easier for us.\r\nMayumi: Magic is something that requires aptitude, but, for us magicians, it's commonplace, and there's a countless variety to it.\r\nSuzuka: Without something distinct to look for, I doubt we'll be able to find any phenomena caused by magic either...\r\nAngelina: It might be enough just to look for anything that gave you \"a small out of place feeling\". If you have any cases like that, we can go check it out and confirm whether it was really caused by magic.\r\nMihono: An out of place feeling. I wonder... if I can really tell. But, I'll try looking!\r\nMiyuki: Please do, Mihono-san.\r\nMayumi: If there's anything we can do, we'll assist you, so feel free to ask us anything. Of course, that includes if you need help getting rid of aradama.\r\nSuzuka: According to the reports, there are situations where magic is useful against aradama, so we would be glad for your help then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Something Off in this World\r\n\r\nSeveral days have passed since meeting Miyuki and the others.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, Yui-chan. It's going your way!\r\nYui: Leave it to us, Kiyoka-chan!\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOO!!\r\nMihono: Let's go, Yui! --HAAAH!\r\nYui: I'm with you whenever you need me!\r\nAradama: ......\r\nKiyoka: Phew. That should be our mission done. Good work, the two of you.\r\nErika: Man, I've been watching for a while, but you three have got some pretty good swordfighting skills.\r\nMihono: Ehehe. You think so-? Thanks a lot!\r\nMiyuki: Erika, are you interested, since you're accustomed to swordfighting yourself?\r\nErika: Well, just a bit.\r\nMihono: Ohh. You are?\r\nErika: With my CAD-- a device that helps activate magic. Mine's this baton I'm holding here.\r\nMihono: Huh-! It kind of just looks like a normal baton though...\r\nMiyuki: Erika deploys magic sequences with her CAD and casts fortification magic on it.\r\nMihono: So, without that c a d... You can't use magic?\r\nMiyuki: It's not as if we can't use it, but, when we do use magic, we generally use CAD to speed up the activation time.\r\nMiyuki: Though, it may be slightly difficult to understand for someone who isn't familiar with magic...\r\nErika: It's probably pretty hard to get a handle on it.\r\nErika: Ah, that's right. I've got a question for you too! You can beat those aradama so long as you have an okatana, right? Then, if you lent me an okatana, could I fight?\r\nKiyoka: You have to go through lots of training to become a toji, and, besides that... If an okatana doesn't acknowledge you, you won't be able to manifest its power properly... So...\r\nMiyuki: Fufu. You're saying it won't be possible for Erika.\r\nErika: Well that sucks. I was thinking, if I could use an okatana too, then maybe I could help you guys out.\r\nYui: Just having you cheering us on is plenty! You're good looking and you've got a great body, and Miyuki-san is so pretty I can't wrap my head around it!\r\nErika: Flattering me won't get you anywhere~. Alright, how about we head back now.\r\nMihono: Hopefully Mirja-san and Mayumi-san have found a clue to helping you get back home by now.\r\n\r\nMirja: Putting it bluntly, we haven't had any results at all so far.\r\nMihono: Seriously~...\r\nMirja: I had thought to  get Ban Tsugumi's cooperation in finding any sort of lead, but it seems to have been a pointless trip.\r\nKiyoka: Tsugumi-san isn't here, is she...\r\nMayumi: It would have been nice to gain the help of a larger group of people.\r\nMayumi: Though, I suppose it's difficult asking for advice with a topic like, \"How do we return home to a different world?\"\r\nAngelina: If something strange were going on because of us coming here, we might be able to come up with ideas based on that, but...\r\nMirja: Konohana Suzuka and the others are sharing information, but there don't seem to be any plainly obvious changes or abnormalities.\r\nMayumi: Why don't we have a cup of a tea for now to give ourselves a change of pace? I think that's important at times like these.\r\nMirja: It's true that we should avoid overworking ourselves.\r\n\r\nMayumi: The tea here is quite good, isn't it.\r\nYomi: It wasn't made off the shelf, but seems like it was made brewed with tea leaves. I think that's why it kept such a nice aroma.\r\nAngelina: Hmm, you know your stuff, Yomi.\r\nYomi: It's nothing much. I just have a slight interest in it.\r\nYomi: That aside, was it really alright for us to sit with you?\r\nYume: They're the ones who invited us. You worry too much, Yomi-onee-san. We'd just gotten a break too-.\r\nMayumi: That's right. You're offering us support as well, Yomi-san.\r\nMirja: Is there anything that's troubling you, Mitsui Honoka, Kitayama Shizuku?\r\nHonoka: No. We're fine now. We went around today to the shops that Kiyoka and Yui told us about, and bought some clothes too.\r\nHonoka: Though, it would have been nice if they could have come with us.\r\nShizuku: They had a mission to take care of, so we couldn't bother them.\r\nHonoka: Right. It must be difficult for all you toji. Are Kiyoka and the others still working?\r\nMirja: Those girls should arrive here shortly. They only went to see a toji acquaintance of ours.\r\nYui: Ah, there's Mirja-san and everyone!\r\nMihono: ...Nnnn.\r\nMirja: You look fairly down, Asakura Mihono.\r\nKiyoka: We couldn't get in touch with Chie-san. ...She wasn't in her room either.\r\nHonoka: Um, who is this Chie-san?\r\nYui: An old friend of Mihono's, and she's like the big sister of our investigation team.\r\nMihono: What's Chii-nee up to, anyway... I feel like we haven't had any time to meet lately.\r\nMirja: That's...\r\nMirja: (This past week we've had missions as the investigation team, so it isn't as if we shouldn't have had chances to meet.)\r\nYui: At times like these, you've gotta eat something sweet to get your spirits up!\r\nMayumi: Asakura-san, will it cheer you up if I give you some of my cake?\r\nMihono: Uuu... Thank you, Mayumi-san!\r\nMirja: (It is slightly concerning after all...)\r\n\r\nKanami: I've been having a lot of missions together with you lately, Hiyori-chan. It's sort of rare for that to happen.\r\nHiyori: You're right... That's true.\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nKanami: Did something happen, Hiyori-chan? You've been looking like you're worrying about something ever since our mission at noon.\r\nHiyori: No, it's not like I'm worried about anything. There's just something that's been bothering me.\r\nHiyori: It feels like we've been spending the days the same day after day... Doesn't it feel like that to you?\r\nKanami: Sort of, but I get what you're saying.\r\nKanami: The places and times change up a little bit, but the missions are all the same... Like we're fighting the same kind of aradama over and over.\r\nHiyori: There's slight differences. But, I guess you could call it claustrophibic; there's this small sense of discomfort building...\r\nKanami: When did you first notice it?\r\nHiyori: I can't say exactly when... But, I think it was around the time we met Miyuki and the others.\r\nKanami: Then, if we can pin down what exactly is causing that sense of discomfort--!\r\nMiyuki: It could be the reason why we came to this world... Or, it may at least lead to some sort of clue.\r\nMiyuki: That's what you're thinking, isn't it, Hiyori-san.\r\nHiyori: Miyuki and Erika...\r\nErika: Sorry for dropping in. We went out thinking we'd take a walk around at night, but then you two were sounding so serious talking. We couldn't find a chance to join in.\r\nHiyori: I was thinking I would have to tell everyone soon anyway.\r\nErika: But, you know, that discomfort that you guys are feeling? If I had to say one way or the other, I haven't noticed it at all. Everything in this world is new to me.\r\nMiyuki: That's true. Toji and aradama. They're things we aren't used to and can hardly imagine.\r\nMiyuki: I think it's wonderful that we were able to meet you, Kanami-san, Hiyori-san, but it all feels a bit like a dream.\r\nKanami: Yeah, it really is like a dream. Getting to hang out together with people from a world where magic is real...\r\nKanami: --Wait, it is a dream!? Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: Yeah, I just realized it too.\r\nErika: What do you mean?\r\nHiyori: Before we met you, we were doing a type of image training using dreams.\r\n\r\nHiyori: So Sayaka, who should normally be here at Renpu, is gone too. We really can't get anyone together besides the people here.\r\nKanami: Yeah. I tried sending messages to Mai-chan, Ellen-chan, and Kaoru-chan too, but they haven't responded.\r\nMaki: Juujou. It looks like you've figured something out, so could you tell us all?\r\nMihono: I want to know what it is too, Juujou-san!\r\nHiyori: ...This might all be a dream that we're seeing.\r\nHiyori: Aside from Miyuki and them, the only people here are the ones who participated in the new dream training Tsugumi provided for us.\r\nTojis: !!\r\nSuzuka: So we've been living on in the dream thinking that Ban-san's training was over with?\r\nHiyori: Right. Everything looks so vivid that you wouldn't think it was a dream, so we came to the wrong assumption... We overlooked the biggest possibility.\r\nMaki: That's true... We never were officially told that the training was over.\r\nMirja: We went to discuss this strange situation with Ban Tsugumi here during the day, but failed to meet with her.\r\nYume: But, then why're Miyuki-onee-san and everybody here?\r\nYume: Ah... Is it cause I kept on thinking about how I wanted to use magic in my dream!?\r\nMihono: I-I did that too!? I was wondering if something fun like magic would happen in our dreams...\r\nHiyori: Well, that might've had some kind of effect, but we can't be sure why they appeared here.\r\nKanami: Even if this is a dream, that's pretty weird. Do you have any idea why that could've happened?\r\nMayumi: Thinking about this as a dream, the only thing that comes to mind would be, the day before we became lost in this dream, the six of us were staying the night together?\r\nMiyuki: If it's within a dream, it may be possible. This sort of miraculous meeting too.\r\nShizuku: And, if we wake up from the dream, we should be back in the world we came from. While we're on this crazy train of thought, the reason why we came here might not be all that important.\r\nMayumi/Kanami: That's it!\r\nYomi: It would be wisest to think up ways to awaken ourselves from the dream then.\r\nMayumi: Yes. It might not be anything more than a small lead to go off of, but it's a more definite goal than anything so far.\r\nMaki: Thanks, Juujou. From here, we should follow that line of thinking to solve this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: A Way to Wake From the Dream\r\n\r\nMihono: Ah, owww!!\r\nKiyoka: H-Hono-chan!? Why did you bash your head against the wall all of a sudden!?\r\nMihono: I thought, if I did this... Maybe I'd wake up from the dream.\r\nMiyuki: Even if it is a dream, it's still painful, isn't it? I think you'd better stop, Mihono-san.\r\nMirja: I do appreciate your willingness to try anything, but I wouldn't reccomend doing that.\r\nKiyoka: Even in a dream... If only Tsugumi-san were here, maybe she could teach us something useful...\r\nMaki: At any rate, our problem is finding a way to wake up out of this. Though, there's the possibility that, if we wait long enough, the training will end and Ban Tsugumi will wake us up...\r\nShizuku: It's entirely possible that, while we've spent days in this world, only a few hours will have actually passed once we wake up.\r\nMiyuki: Your goal with using dreams for training was to create a mock experience of your \"ideal self\", wasn't it?\r\nMihono: Yeah, it was. We were supposed to hold onto an ideal image of ourselves.\r\nMayumi: If that's the case, then, if everyone achieves their goal, wouldn't you wake up from the dream?\r\nMaki: That does sound plausible. I appreciate it, Shiba-san, Saegusa-san. That's some helpful advice.\r\nMiyuki: No need to thank us; we only said what came to mind.\r\nMiyuki: And, if you all wake up, as we were saying before, we should all be returned home as well.\r\nAngelina: Aradama exist in this world, and there are no other magicians besides us.\r\nAngtelina: So it should be that this world is based on the toji's consciousness, or their dreams. If they wake up, it should disappear.\r\nMihono: The schools and everything are all stuff we know too.\r\nMirja: Then, why don't we think once more about our \"ideal selves\".\r\n\r\nMirja: Improving your ability to read a situation is not something that can be done in a single day. Though, if you wish to improve in that area, I may be able to help you some.\r\nMirja: What will you do, Yamashiro Yui?\r\nYui: I want to keep all the cute girls safe! If you'll teach me how, Mirja-san, I'll try as hard as you want me! I hope you'll be deep and thorough!\r\nMirja: I'll teach you even if you don't get closer like that. Then, let's review the fighting that took place in the mission earlier.\r\n\r\nMihono: By the way, what kind of ideal did you think up, Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: I was thinking... During missions, I want to do a good job fulfilling my own role; something vague like that. I don't have a clear image yet...\r\nMayumi: In that case, why not talk it over with us for a bit? It could provide you hints as to what sort of role would suit you.\r\nKiyoka: ...! Thank you very much, Mayumi-san.\r\n\r\nHiyori: Our ideal image of a toji... We were suddenly pulled into the training, so it's hard to come up with.\r\nKanami: Maybe you don't have to worry about it so much. I think you're fine staying the way you are now, Hiyori-chan.\r\nHiyori: Kanami...\r\nKanami: So, help me out, Hiyori-chan! Let's have a sparring match straight away! To bring me closer to my ideal self!\r\nHiyori: You... just wanted to have a match with me, didn't you.\r\nErika: Kanami-. If you're looking for a sparring partner, how about me?\r\nKanami: Really!?\r\nErika: We both probably have two different concepts of swordfighting. But, I think there'll be enough in common.\r\nKanami: I'd love to have you! Erika-san!\r\nErika: That's the spirit! Don't go holding back on me, okay?\r\nKanami: I hope you'll get serious too!\r\n\r\nMiyuki: I'm sorry about her. Watching you all fight, it seems like Erika has been wanting to test her own strength.\r\nHiyori: Kanami's happy to do it, so it's not a problem.\r\nMiyuki: Simply coming up with an ideal image of yourself is difficult, isn't it. I thought a bit about what I would come up with myself.\r\nHiyori: ...Do you you think you could tell me yours, for reference? Kanami said I'm fine the way I am, but I have my own thoughts on it.\r\nMiyuki: ......\r\nMiyuki: I have someone who I don't want to disappoint, more than any other. I want to be someone that person can be proud of... That's what I thought.\r\nMiyuki: Ahh!? I'm sorry... I was supposed to be helping tell you my ideal, but I couldn't get it across very well, could I.\r\nHiyori: Not at all, thanks. I'm sure that, if there's somebody you don't want to dissappoint, you'll keep putting in effort.\r\nHiyori: I'll think about it a little.\r\nMiyuki: Of course; do what you can, Hiyori-san.\r\n\r\nMirja: It's been what feels like several days. Even though we tried various things to simulate our ideals, we haven't seen any major changes so far.\r\nMayumi: I thought it was a brilliant idea when we came up with it though...\r\nSuzuka: Your line of thinking was probably correct, Saegusa-san. It's just that, everyone's ideal selves are so disjointed that it's slightly difficult understanding how to achieve them all...\r\nErika: Then, in that case, is there any ideal that every toji would work towards?\r\nKanami: An ideal for all toji...\r\nKanami: That's it! What Konohana-san said just before we started the training!\r\nMaki: -! The ideal of most toji would be suppressing aradama while keeping casualties to a minimum-- That one, right?\r\nKanami: Yeah! What if we worked toward that as our goal?\r\nHonoka: I think that's a great goal to have.\r\nMihono: Then it's settled!\r\nMiyuki: We'll help you as well, in reducing the damage caused by aradama.\r\nSuzuka: Thank you very much. Though it may be a dream, there are still people here who need to be protected. Let's carefully work out our strategies and put them into action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Fighting United in a Dream. And then--\r\n\r\nMirja: People in the surrounding area are in the process of evacuating. Encircle the aradama and do not allow them to escape!\r\nMihono: YAAA!\r\nAradama: GGGII...\r\nHiyori: You're really giving it your all, Mihono.\r\nMihono: That's cause I'd hate being stuck in a dream forever.\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOO...!\r\nKiyoka: Eh!? They came from outside the circle!?\r\nMayumi: It's alright, Musumi-san.\r\nMayumi: --Take this!\r\nMaki: Saegusa-san, thanks for stopping them with your magic!\r\nMaki: We're going to take care of the aradama who freshly appeared! Yomi, stick close to me!\r\nYomi: Understood.\r\nYui: Ah, Maki-san! Could I go with you too? The number of aradama in the circle is already going down!\r\nMaki: Sure. We'll sweep through them in one go!\r\nKiyoka: Thanks a lot. I panicked a little.\r\nMayumi: All I did was stop them for a moment by hitting them with dry ice.\r\nKiyoka: It's dangerous for you here, Mayumi-san, so please stand back.\r\nKiyoka: I can't come up with an ideal image for myself as a toji right away, but I'm not worried over what I need to do right now.\r\nMayumi: That's the spirit. Hang in there.\r\n\r\nAradama: GGGGUUU...!\r\nYomi: More and more are coming.\r\nErika: --HAAAAAAAAAH!\r\nAradama: ...OOOONNNN.\r\nMaki: Chiba Erika!?\r\nErika: It's not in me to sit in the back and watch. I'm here to back you up. Come on, you've gotta finish it off already!\r\nMaki: --YAAAAAAAA!\r\nMaki: I understand that you're skilled, but be more careful with yourself.\r\nErika: If that's what you're worried about, then hurry up and beat them. Looks like more are coming.\r\nMaki: Fine then. It's just a dream. I'll overlook it here.\r\n\r\nShizuku: Erika couldn't resist herself, could she.\r\nAngelina: She must have been watching Miyuki and the others spamming out magic to back them up too.\r\nHonoka: Aren't you going to go in and help too, Lina?\r\nAngelina: Asking me that right after that... Aren't you making me sound like a person who likes going wild with her magic?\r\nHonoka: Ah. S-Sorry... I didn't mean it that way!?\r\nAngelina: I know. I'm going to hold off here.\r\nShizuku: In that case, let's move further back. It'd be bad if we got in their way.\r\n\r\nMiyuki: I won't let you do as you please!\r\nMiyuki: I've sealed the aradama's movements, but it won't last long. Please finish them off.\r\nAradama: ......\r\nYume: Leave it to me-.\r\nYume: Wow, Miyuki-onee-san's magic seriously froze the aradama rock solid.\r\nYume: Anybody could beat them easy like this-. Though-- It's a little boring to me!\r\nKanami: The risks of the mission sure drop way down, handling things this way.\r\nSuzuka: True. It wouldn't be easy to make a reality in the near future... But, surely someday it could be like this.\r\nSuzuka: In order for that to happen, we'll need to put thought into many more things than solely fighting with aradama.\r\nSuzuka: --Now then, it's about time we finished things here.\r\n\r\nEveryone: Cheers!\r\nMihono: I think everyone tried really hard!\r\nMirja: It feels as if we were only able to fight in the ideal manner we'd one day like to achieve because Shiba Miyuki and the others lent us their strength.\r\nMiyuki: I'm honored you'd speak so highly of us.\r\nKiyoka: I wonder if we'll now wake up in the real world when we sleep tonight.\r\nErika: What'll we do if we wake up seeing each other again after we threw this big party?\r\nMaki: If there's nothing we can do about our situation... I don't want to think about it.\r\nSuzuka: If it comes to that, it might be better for us to simply leisurely enjoy our time here.\r\nSuzuka: A lengthy vacation isn't something we could easily take, is it?\r\nYume: Then, we should go to the pool or an amusement park!\r\nYui: I'm going too!\r\nMiyuki: I think it's wonderful you can all stay so positive. Though, I have a premonition about this.\r\nMiyuki: I'm sure that Onii-sama will be there to wake me in the morning.\r\nErika: Uwah! Now we get a look at how serious Miyuki's brother complex is!\r\nAngelina: It must feel like it's been countless days since she saw Tatsuya, so maybe she's going through withdrawals?\r\nMiyuki: Honestly, you two. I'll get mad. I was speaking seriously.\r\nKanami: You're serious, huh...\r\nKanami: Though, you know, Ban-san will probably wake us up too. Sooner or later.\r\nHiyori: Saying that means calling it quits...\r\nKanami: Yeah, Kanami. Even though we even had Miyuki-san and them helping us.\r\nMayumi: Dreams are something we all have to wake up from sometime. But, it would be nice if we don't forget our meeting.\r\nKiyoka: I agree.\r\nShizuku: I wasn't sure how this would go at first though.\r\nHonoka: You all really took good care of us, and it was a lot of fun.\r\nAngelina: It might be hard meeting again after saying goodbye, but take care.\r\nErika: Wait wait, quit getting all sentimental all of a sudden!\r\nErika: Let's eat some good food and live it up. Since we're in a dream, we don't have to worry about calories either.\r\nMihono: I'm all for what Erika-san's saying!\r\nKanami: Sure! Here, Hiyori-chan. There's a chocolate mint cake too.\r\nHiyori: Oi, don't go making it sound like all I eat is chocolate mint.\r\nMiyuki: Fufu. I think I'll try some of that chocolate mint as well.\r\nMiyuki: (Even if this is goodbye-- I pray that we someday have such a wonderful encounter again.)\r\n\r\nTsugumi: With this, the test of training making use of dreaming while sleeping has finished. Please remain where you are for a moment. I'll come in to get you.\r\nTsugumi: How was this new form of training, everyone?\r\nMihono: I missed you so much, Chii-neeeee!\r\nChie: M-Mihono-chan!? Hugging me all of a sudden... Did you have a scary dream?\r\nMihono: No. But... I felt a little like I might never see you again.\r\nChie: You don't have to worry. I'm not going anywhere.\r\nChie: Tsugumi-san. How long were we sleeping for?\r\nTsugumi: Let's see, it's been a little under four hours now-.\r\nMirja: ...It feels like ten days had already passed in the dream.\r\nTsugumi: I see. It seems I'll need to make some improvements in that regard. You've done enough for today, so I would be happy if you'd submit a report at a later date.\r\nTsugumi: And, if there's any concerns you have, please go right ahead and ask.\r\nYume: It was kinda fun though, wasn't it-.\r\nYomi: It was. Though, I'm not sure I'll be able to sleep tonight.\r\nKanami: Do you think Miyuki-san and them were really there?\r\nHiyori: There's no way for us to be sure. But, I think it was a valuable experience.\r\nKanami: Yeah. They were all such good people, and they helped us suppress the aradama without anyone getting hurt.\r\nKanami: It'd be nice if someday we'll be able to carry out missions as safely as that."}, {"paste_key": "4E3hJkmJ", "title": "5-2 The Instigators up North", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/4E3hJkmJ", "timestamp": "", "hits": "118", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/kbhGuet_kEw\r\n\r\n1: Worry\r\n\r\nMihono: This thing that's happening to me... Akira-san said they knew the reason why it's going rampant...\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMihono: What should I... do now? She said, \"before it's too late,\" but...\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: .........\r\nMihono: I can't tell anything thinking here like this~! I'll just have to ask them directly!!\r\n\r\nMirja: Absolutely not.\r\nMihono: Ehh~!!\r\nChie: Mmm, I think... I'm against it too.\r\nChie: I'm worried, after you lost control again. And, this... Inago-san? We can't even be sure if she's telling the truth...\r\nMihono: But, Kaoru-san said that Akira-san was from Mokusa too!\r\nChie:\u3000Even if she is... What we call Mokusa has lots of smaller factions to it...\r\nMihono: It does?\r\nChie: ...Yes. I don't know them all very well myself, but, aside from the main faction which aims to enshrine and suppress aradama, there are meant to be people with lots of different ideologies.\r\nMirja: With all our research into Kashuu Kiyomitsu, we've found nothing but dead ends. They may say they know, but frankly I find that dubious at best.\r\nMirja: Inago Akira... was it?\r\nMihono: Ah, Akira-san was the one who said they knew, but she said the one who really knows is her childhood friend. I think her name was... Hitakami Makoto-san?\r\nChie: Hitakami... Makoto?\r\nMirja: Do you know her?\r\nChie: Y-Yes. She's a toji from Osafune.\r\nChie: Hitakami Makoto is a third year in Osafune Girls' Academy's high school division. It was only for a little while, but... we were in the same unit once too.\r\nMihono: Come to think of it, I never really heard much about what you were doing back then. Did you get along with her?\r\nChie: Well, I don't think we got along too badly. I was curious how she was doing... She's working hard it seems.\r\nMihono: You seem kind of happy about it?\r\nChie: Fufu, that's true.\r\nChie: I wasn't expecting her name to come up here, so you caught me by surprise.\r\nChie: If it's Makoto, I think it might be alright, but...\r\nMirja: ...\r\nMihono: What's Hitakami-san like, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: A yamato nadeshiko. If I wanted to describe Makoto, there's no phrase that fits her better. \t[Just look up yamato nadeshiko to see a list of adjectives, but it's essentially the epitome of traits that make up an ideal Japanese woman.]\r\nChie: She's gentle, and ladylike, and intelligent... Though, she could be stubborn too.\r\nChie: On top of that, she had real skill as a toji.\r\nMirja: This toji, Hitakami Makoto, she didn't participate in the tournament, did she?\r\nChie: Osafune has Kaoru-san and Ellen-san there. It would be a little difficult fighting those two to be selected for the tournament.\r\nMirja: I see...\r\nMirja: (However, Inago Akira and Hitakami Makoto... For them to be so powerful, their names are relatively unknown...)\r\nMirja: (...No, I must be reading too deeply into it.)\r\nChie: Was there something that caught your attention?\r\nMirja: ...There wasn't.\r\nMirja: We should go speak with them in the near future. However, please wait just a little longer first.\r\nMihono: A little longer?\r\nMirja: Yes. In that time, I would like to find more on Inago Akira, Hitakami Makoto, and, the other one...\r\nMihono: Yuuki. Toribane Yuuki.\r\nMirja: Toribane Yuuki, was it. I'm going to gather information on these three.\r\nMihono: Information...?  I don't think you have to go that far, do you...\r\nMirja: You need to understand the gravity of the situation.\r\nMirja: For Kashuu Kiyomitsu... For an okatana's power to go rampant is nothing to take lightly.\r\nMirja: Things are the way they are because the investigation team is working directly under the Origami Family... But we have no way of knowing when that may change.\r\nMirja: We need to act with caution right now.\r\nMihono: ...Is the situation really that bad?\r\nMirja: Without a doubt. You should assume that your situation is more unstable than you realize.\r\nMihono: ...Alright.\r\nMirja: In addition, no matter what comes up, please refrain from using Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power. Do you understand?\r\nMihono: ......I understand.\r\nMirja: (If I force the issue this much, she should avoid going rampant again for the time being.)\r\nMirja: (If Asakura Mihono were to repeatedly lose control, her position will certainly worsen.)\r\nMirja: (Though... There is now even more work to be done. I'll need to immediately find information on Hitakami Makoto, Inago Akira, and Toribane Yuuki...)\r\nMihono: Aradama!?\r\nChie: ...It's fine for you to wait on standby today, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: No, I can fight even without using that power, and I'll feel better getting some exercise than sitting around worrying!\r\nMirja: Very well then.\r\nMirja: ...The investigation team will sortie as soon as we've assembled!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Results of Investigating the Hitakami Faction\r\n\r\nAt that time--\r\n\r\nYukari: How is the investigation into Mokusa's extremist factions going?\r\nMaki: We've finished compiling data on all the related individuals. Yomi.\r\nYomi: Yes, here it is.\r\nYume: Hmm... Oh, huh?\r\nSuzuka: What is it?\r\nYume: I feel like, there's someone in here I've seen before.\r\nSuzuka: Well now. For you to remember someone, even slightly, they must be somewhat capable.\r\nSuzuka: Yume, that's a toji that you once cut down.\r\nYume: Ah... They're in here too, huh.\r\nYukari: That was all under Tagitsuhime's influence. Does it still bother you?\r\nYume: ...It's the truth though, that I'm the one who attacked Mokusa.\r\nYukari: Then, you'll need to prove it with your actions going forward. How the new Tsubakuro has changed from the old one.\r\nYume: The old me, and the new me... I got it, Yukari-sama!\r\nYukari: Good.\r\nYukari: Satsuki, which of these faction requires our attention?\r\nYomi: There are several, but... The most important one is the Hitakami faction.\r\nYukari: The faction headed by the Hitakami Family, the distinguished toji family from Tohoku...\r\nYomi: Yes. Their position is to reduce harm suffered by toji while suppressing aradama. They have stated they are willing to find positive applications for aradama to make that happen.\r\nSuzuka: Positive applications for aradama... Do you know what exactly they mean?\r\nYomi: I wasn't able to find that much. However, they appear to be carrying out some experiments utilizing aradama.\r\nYomi: It seems they've acquired materials on the Myouga toji project as well, so we can assume they are making real advances.\r\nMaki: Myouga toji...\r\nMaki: Did they not join in back then because they determined Tagitsuhime wouldn't reduce toji casualties?\r\nYukari: They may espouse radical ideals, but they shouldn't have shown any serious movements before now.\r\nYomi: Recently, the previous head of the family passed away. Her daughter has now inherited her position.\r\nYomi: The current head of the Hitakami family is... Hitakami Makoto. And, the toji closest to Hitakami Makoto would be...\r\nYomi: Both Inago Akira and Toribane Yuuki.\r\nMaki: Inago Akira...?\r\nMaki: Yomi. Hasn't this toji come to see you before?\r\nYomi: ...She has.\r\nYomi: Hitakami Makoto, Inago Akira, Toribane Yuuki... I come from the same town as the three of them.\r\nSuzuka: Which means... They're from Akita?\r\nYomi: Yes. I went to the same elementary school as the three of them... And, in particular, Inago Akira's home was in my neighborhood.\r\nKaoru: Special Raid Unit, Mashiko Kaoru, coming in-.\r\nSayaka: Itomi Sayaka, entering.\r\nKaoru: Is Origami Yukari here? I brought the report from our last mission.\r\nYukari: Did something happen?\r\nKaoru: Asakura Mihono got overwhelmed by the power of Kashuu Kiyomitsu and went on a rampage. What's the deal with that okatana?\r\nMaki: Mashiko Kaoru, watch your tone when talking to Yukari-sama...\r\nYukari: It's fine, Shidou.\r\nMaki: ...Yes ma'am.\r\nYukari: What happened with Asakura Mihono?\r\nKaoru: Me and Sayaka managed to stop her. But, it was pretty close.\r\nYume: Even with you and Sayaka-chan, she came pretty close to beating you!?\r\nSayaka: Mm. Mihono was strong.\r\nYume: She went on a rampage, hm... Yukari-sama! I want to try fighting that onee-san when she's rampaging!\r\nYukari: You can't.\r\nYukari: ...You two did well. Was there anything else that happened?\r\nKaoru: A toji who was there said something that got my attention. That, she knew what was happening to Mihono.\r\nSuzuka: That is a rather concerning statement. ...What was this toji's name? We'll make preparations to summon her here straight away.\r\nKaoru: Inago Akira.\r\nSuzuka: ...! The toji from the Hitakami faction...\r\nMaki: There's a bad pattern forming here...\r\nYukari: ...Thank you for your efforts.\r\nKaoru: Then, I made my report and all. We're leaving, Sayaka.\r\nSayaka: Okay.\r\nSuzuka: Yukari-sama, should we question her?\r\nYukari: ...Let her go for now.\r\nSuzuka: Understood.\r\nYukari: All of you, please continue the investigation.\r\nMaki: Yes ma'am!\r\nYomi: ............\r\nYomi: ...Akira.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: No Matter How Many Times I Repeat It\r\n\r\nYomi: Shidou-san, do you have a moment?\r\nMaki: What do you need, Yomi?\r\nYomi: During our lunch break, I'm going to step out for a while. I should be back in an hour.\r\nMaki: It's up to you how you spend your breaks... But, you don't often ask things like that.\r\nYomi: Now is a good time for me to visit.\r\nMaki: Do you mind if I ask where you're going?\r\nYomi: ...The hospital.\r\n\r\nYomi: Excuse me.\r\nYukina: ...Come in.\r\nYomi: ...How is your health?\r\nYukina: Fine.\r\nYomi: I brought flowers and fruits.\r\nYukina: Oh.\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYomi: I'll replace the water for the flowers.\u3000\r\nYukina: ...\r\n\r\nYomi: ...\r\nYukina: ...\r\nYomi: ...I need to leave soon.\r\nYukina: Right.\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYomi: I'm not sure if you're aware, but I was assigned to the Special Defense Team.\r\nYomi: I plan to make use of this power there.\r\nYukina: ...Don't you regret it?\r\nYomi: I don't.\r\nYomi: If the same thing were to happen... I would join you again.\r\nYukina: ...Oh.\r\nYomi: I'm sorry to have bothered you.\r\nYukina: ...\r\nYomi: I'll come again.\r\nYukina: ...\r\nYukina: ...Okay.\r\n\r\nYomi: I've returned.\r\nMaki: How's she doing?\r\nYomi: Her body is recovering properly. But... she seems depressed.\r\nMaki: I see.\r\nYomi: I'm returning to my assignment.\r\nMaki: ...\r\nMaki: Do you really not want to remove your aradama?\r\nYomi: I don't.\r\nYomi: This is the power that she gave to me. With this power... I'll perform my duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Training! (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: Hello-!\r\nTsugumi: Oh?\r\nKofuki: Yo, Mihocchi. What brings you here today?\r\nMihono: I came to do a little training!\r\nKofuki/Tsugumi: Training?\r\n\r\nMihono: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: Give me the next one, please!\r\nTsugumi: Understood. Releasing the next aradama.\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOOOOOO!\r\nMihono: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: Next!\r\n\r\nKofuki: Hey hey, she's pretty fired up. I wasn't sure if she was serious when shesaid you wanted to train, but she's really going at it.\r\nTsugumi: Are you not going to join her, Shichinosato-san?\r\nKofuki: She said she wants to train, so if I went in there, I'd get in her way.\r\nTsugumi: Huh.\r\nKofuki: ...What.\r\nKofuki: Mihocchi's going through a lot right now. So I'm letting her have her way a little. You got a problem with that?\r\nTsugumi: There's no problem at all.\r\nKofuki: Course not.\r\nMihono: Next one, please!\r\nTsugumi: The next one... Ah.\r\nKofuki: What's up?\r\nTsugumi: This is the final set.\r\nKofuki: Say that sooner! We're swapping out, Mihocchi!\r\nTsugumi: Were you not going to let Asakura-san have her way?\r\nKofuki: I didn't say I was letting her have everything! I wanna have fun with some aradama-chan too!\r\n\r\nKofuki: So anyway, swap out with me already, Mihocchi!\r\nMihono: Ehh-! Just let me go a little longer, Fukki!\r\nKofuki: Hell no! You're gonna get rid of my share!\r\nTsugumi: There are a lot in the final set for one person to handle alone. Why don't the two of you do it together?\r\nMihono: Hear that! Let's split it, Fukki!\r\nKofuki: If we have to... But, you get exactly half, alright!\r\nMihono: Sure!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Training! (2)\r\n\r\nKofuki: We had fun, aradama-chan! Mihocchi! The last one's going your way!\r\nMihono: Okay!\r\nAradama: AAAAAAAA!\r\nMihono: This is the last one... Urghh.\r\nKofuki: Mihocchi?\r\nMihono: U-Urgh...\r\nAradama: GYAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nKofuki: You got a stomachache!?\r\nKofuki: Alright, then just sit tight!!\r\nMihono: Fukki, don't move!!\r\nKofuki: !?\r\nMihono: ...You can't, come over here...! AAAAAAGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!\r\nAradama: -!!\r\nKofuki: Wha!? Mihocchi just swung her okatana, and...!\r\nTsugumi: That was quite the empowered strike... It looked to be a high level of hachimanriki.\r\nKofuki: Who gives a shit about levels and whatever right now!? Oi, Mihocchi! What do you want me to do!?\r\nMihono: It's okay... It's okay... Letting some power out, I think it's calming down...\r\nMihono: [pant, pant...]\r\nKofuki: ...Did she get it under control?\r\nTsugumi: ...It looks like she did.\r\nKofuki: Mihocchi, can I come over to you now?\r\nMihono: ...Yeah, it's fine. I'm sorry, for making you worry.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Have some milk.\r\nMihono: Thanks a lot. [gulp gulp...] Phew.\r\nTsugumi: Did it calm you down? It's from Shichinosato-san's special stock, so I can vouch for the taste.\r\nKofuki: Who said you could go take from that! ...Well, it's fine this time, I guess.\r\nMihono: Ahaha. This is pretty tasty.\r\nKofuki: Right? It's been my new favorite.\r\nKofuki: ...So, that's that rampage thing, huh? You scared me, when that came out of nowhere.\r\nMihono: That was one step away from it... I think? Last time I lost consciousness, but I managed to stay awake through it this time...\r\nTsugumi: I did collect data during it, just in case, but... There was too little data to make anything out...\r\nTsugumi: The situation was more tense than I expected. Is there any way you could safely reproduce that?\r\nMihono: I don't... think I could. I don't want it to go rampant that many times anyway...\r\nMihono: I don't know anything about why it's going rampant... or how I can get Kashuu Kiyomitsu under control in the first place.\r\nKofuki: ...Can you actually even control that? It... looked pretty bad to me.\r\nMihono: To be honest... I'm not really sure.\r\nTsugumi: I'm not sure how possible this is, but... One option is to try exchanging for a different okatana.\r\nMihono: But... I don't want to do that.\r\nMihono: Kashuu Kiyomitsu is the okatana I inherited from my mother. I don't want to be scared of it.\r\nKofuki: Well... I'm not sure I can do much, but, if there's anything I can do to help, tell me, alright?\r\nMihono: Thanks, Fukki. But, you don't have to worry about me that much.\r\nMihono: (...I wasn't even trying to use Kiyomitsu's power there. Does that mean I'm running out of time?)\r\nMihono: (Hitakami Makoto-san... Maybe I will go talk to her.)\r\nKofuki: Your phone's ringing, Mihocchi.\r\nMihono: Uhh... Oh, my next assignment came in. I have to suppress aradama that appeared in the Tohoku region.\r\nMihono: Joining in are... Akira-san, and Yuuki.\r\nTsugumi: Is something wrong?\r\nMihono: Ah, no, I'm just going with people I know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: To Tohoku (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: They're supposed to be here... Oh, there they are! Heyyy! Akira-san! Yuuki!\r\nAkita: Oh, you made it, Mihono.\r\nYuuki: It's been a while, Mihono-san. Has it gone rampant since then...?\r\nMihono: Thanks for worrying about me, Yuuki. Yeah, it did a little...\r\nYuuki: Is that so...\r\nAkira: ...We're all here, so why don't we get going.\r\n\r\nYuuki: It's been such a long time since I rode on a train together with Akira-nee-sama. Ever since you got your license, you've always been on your bike.\r\nAkira: Nn? Ahh, now that you mention it, you're right.\r\nAkira: Well, nothing wrong with taking the train from time to time. Yuuki, Mihono, you want an orange?\r\nYuuki: I'll have one.\r\nMihono: Ah, okay... It's cold!?\r\nYuuki: They're refridgerated oranges. ...Mm, it's cold and sweet.\r\nMihono: Haha, that's for sure.\r\nMihono: ...Can I ask you something, Akira-san?\r\nAkira: Hmm-? What's up?\r\nMihono: What you said to me, before... What is it that's happening to me?\r\nAkira: Ahh, it's about that. ...Want another orange?\r\nYuuki: Ah, I'll take it. Thank you very much, Nee-sama.\r\nMihono: Akira-san!\r\nAkira: O-Oi, don't go shouting. The passengers're all looking.\r\nMihono: You weren't lying to me, were you?\r\nYuuki: Nee-sama doesn't tell lies, Mihono-san.\r\nMihono: That's what I believe too, but still!\r\nAkira: You're panicking, aren't you.\r\nMihono: I let out a crazy strong hachimanriki... I managed to stop it before I did more than that, but...\r\nAkira: Next time, you might not be so lucky, right.\r\nMihono: ...Right.\r\nAkira: Sorry bout this. I wanna talk about it, but it's just something someone told me too, and it's a real long story at that.\r\nAkira: But, we should be able to explain the stuff you wanna know, so don't panic over it. We're getting things ready for you.\r\nMihono: Getting things ready?\r\nAkira: Yeah. So, for now, just kick back and have some cooled oranges.\r\n\r\nAradama: GURURU...\r\nYuuki: The readings on the spectrum finder have vanished. That aradama looks to be the last of them.\r\nAkira: That's our job done. ...Mihono.\r\nMihono: ...Y-Yes?\r\nAkira: You know we're with Mokusa, don't you?\r\nMihono: Yes, I know.\r\nAkira: Our faction's base is right around here. We can have a nice long chat there.\r\nMihono: It's right around here...?\r\nYuuki: It's Makoto-onee-sama's family home! It's so large it might surprise you.\r\nMihono: Huh-!\r\nMihono: -! Akira-san, Yuuki! There's something there...\r\n???: GRRRRRR...!\t\t[All other aradama use katakana for growls. This one alternates between katakana and hiragana.]\r\nMihono: What is that...? An animal... Or, an aradama...?\r\nAkira: ...!\r\nAkira: Yuuki. Take Mihono and go on ahead.\r\nYuuki: Right. Let's go, Mihono-san.\r\nMihono: Wait! If that's an aradama, I'll fight it with you!\r\nAkira: That's not it. This's just one of our screwups. You've gotta clean up your own mistakes.\r\nYuuki: Mihono-san, we're going!!\r\nMihono: H-Hey, Yuuki! Don't pull me!\r\n\r\nAkira: Sigh...\r\n???: GURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!\r\nAkira: They totally fucked this up. Somebody's going off on their own again not listening to Makocchan.\r\nAkira: You've had your share of misfortune too... I'm gonna have you quiet down for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: To Tohoku (2)\r\n\r\n???: ...[whimper]...\r\nAkira: ...Sorry.\r\nAkira: Just gonna tie you to this tree while I can... Alright. I'll have somebody come pick you up.\r\nAkira: Damnit, if only Hirona was around. There's hardly anybody we can count on here...\r\n\r\nMihono: Hey, Yuuki! What was that, back there?\r\nYuuki: ...\r\nMihono: Was it an aradama? But, it seemed sort of different...\r\nMihono: Hey, Yuuki!\r\nYuuki: ......\r\nAkira: Oh. I finally caught up to you.\r\nMihono: Akira-san! Are you okay?\r\nAkira: Sure, it wasn't a big deal.\r\nMihono: What was that thing back there?\r\nAkira: You don't have to worry about that now. Either way, I'm sure you'll learn about it soon enough.\r\nMihono: What do you mean...?\r\nAkira: We should be talking about that \"power\" of yours first, right? Let's get you to see Makocchan already.\r\nMihono: ...Yeah.\r\nAkira: This way. Stick with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Hitakami Makoto (1)\r\n\r\nAkira: It's here.\r\nMihono: ...Yuuki told me about it, but it sure is a huge mansion. It's like the Origami house...\r\nAkira: The Hitakamis are an old family, just like the Origamis. They've gotta have a bigass house to match their image.\r\nAkira: Alright, let's go on in. Makocchan's gonna get sick of waiting.\r\n\r\nHitakami Makoto: Thank you for your time, Asakura Mihono-san. I am the head of the Hitakami family, Hitakami Makoto.\r\nMihono: (So this is Hitakami Makoto-san...)\r\nMakoto: Inago, Toribane. Please leave me alone with Asakura-san.\r\nAkira: Sure.\r\nYuuki: Very well then.\r\nMakoto: Asakura-san?\r\nMihono: Y-Yes!\r\nMakoto: There's no need for you to be so nervous.\r\nMakoto: How informed are you about us... About Mokusa's Hitakami faction?\r\nMihono: ...I pretty much don't know anything. Is it... bad that I don't know anything...?\r\nMakoto: No, that won't be a problem at all. I'll begin my explanation from there.\r\nMakoto: As the name suggests, the Hitakami faction is led by the Hitakami family-- A faction based here, in the Tohoku region, out of our old home.\r\nMakoto: And our ideology is to make effective use of aradama, for the benefit of toji and society.\r\nMihono: To use aradama... Do you mean like Myouga toji...?\r\nMakoto: The case involving Myouga toji and Tagitsuhime was an unfortunate incident that brought about many victims...\r\nMakoto: Nevertheless, humans are ever-evolving creatures. Spurred on by that incident, we have been able to make progress.\r\nMihono: Progress...?\r\nMakoto: Now then, this introduction has gone on rather long, hasn't it.\r\nMakoto: There is something I am able to tell you, in regards to your power.\r\nMakoto: Firstly, let us speak of your family line... Let's speak of the Asakura family.\r\nMakoto: There is a deep connection between the Hitakami and the Asakura. The full nature of which has been passed down through this family.\r\nMakoto: Yet... Before I may explain it to you, there is something I must inquire.\r\nMihono: What's that?\r\nMakoto: Your resolve.\r\nMakoto: After our conversation has finished, you will know the truth of Kashuu Kiyomitsu.\r\nMakoto: However... Once you know that, you will be unable to return to your former life.\r\nMihono: -!?\r\nMakoto: To have the truth made clear... Do you have the resolve to step over to our side?\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: You say resolve, but, I'm not sure. All I know is... I don't want to be afraid of Kiyomitsu.\r\nMihono: This okatana... It's something I got from my mother; something important to remember her by.\r\nMakoto: You do have a good look in your eyes. Very well.\r\nMakoto: Then, there is one last thing I will check for myself. Whether you truly have the disposition for it. Whether... you are a descendant of Atago.\r\nMihono: Atago...?\r\nMakoto: Please come with me.\r\n\r\nMakoto: This place should do well.\r\nMakoto: I am now going to wield my okatana with the intent of killing you. Please fight back earnestly.\r\nMihono: Eh? Killing me... What...!?\r\nMihono: ...!?\r\nMakoto: If you do not fight, you will die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: Hitakami Makoto (2)\r\n\r\nMakoto: HAA-!!\r\nMihono: Gh!!\r\nMihono: (She's strong! There's a toji this strong here!?)\r\nMihono: If you're this strong, why weren't you in the tournament? You, and Akira-san too... You would have definitely placed high!\r\nMakoto: Our power isn't for fighting in tournaments. It's for protecting the people. Is that not the truth, Asakura Mihono-san?\r\nMihono: (I just thought it was natural to join in the tournament and win there...)\r\nMihono: (But, Hitakami-san is... Ughh!?)\r\nMihono: ...! Kashuu Kiyomitsu's......! Get away from me...!\r\nAkira: Makocchan! Did Mihono lose control!?\r\nYuuki: Were you unhurt, Makoto-nee-sama!\r\nMakoto: I'm entirely fine. I must have made you worry, Akira-chan, Yuuki-chan.\r\nMakoto: Though, it was worth taking the risk.\r\nMihono: AGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!\r\nMakoto: I've confirmed that power for myself. She's just the collaborator we need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: Investigation Without Progress\r\n\r\nMirja: Musumi Kiyoka, were there any accounts of Kashuu Kiyomitsu or the Asakura family, in the records you have?\r\nKiyoka: There's nothing in here. What about in yours, Mirja-san?\r\nMirja: It's the same. There's no results.\r\nKiyoka: Really...\r\nKiyoka: I want to hurry and find some information that will give Hono-chan peace of mind...\r\nMirja: ...Yes. Though, I can't understand it.\r\nKiyoka: Eh?\r\nMirja: There isn't a single account of any okatana, not just Kashuu Kiyomitsu, running rampant.\r\nKiyoka: There isn't, is there...\r\nKiyoka: But, it seems like, if someone lost control of an okatana's power, there would definitely be records of it...\r\nMirja: Did someone conceal them, or, was this the first case of an okatana's power going rampant...\r\nMirja: (But, if that were the case, it contradicts Inago Akira... Her statement that Hitakami Makoto knows the phenomenon happening to Asakura Mihono.)\r\nMirja: (Hitakami Makoto... The Hitakami faction...)\r\nMirja: Time is precious. Let's push on, Musumi Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: Right!"}, {"paste_key": "DP0ZZXZW", "title": "Inami Suu Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/DP0ZZXZW", "timestamp": "", "hits": "97", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/z_ITNXUtuEE\r\nhttps://youtu.be/ee9V9yy0uqk\r\nhttps://youtu.be/6vDEoQfMR6o\r\n\r\n1: Hokuto's Spartan Training\r\n\r\nSuu: Where should I go with Hokuto-san tomorrow?\r\nSuu: She's finally coming out to Renpu, so it'd be nice if we could have a good time together.\r\nSuu: Though, I'd like to try and make her a fan of Garden or Hell Angel Marvelous-chan... I don't know where to take her-!\r\n\r\nHokuto: One, two! One, two! Swing! Swing! Swing! Swing!\r\nSuu: (...Right, even I've had times when I was getting overly optimistic...)\r\nSuu: (I should have known... It's Hokuto-san after all. Of course we would end up training...)\r\nHokuto: Suu! You're losing focus!\r\nSuu: R-Right!\r\nSuu: (How could she tell!? But still, my arms are heavy, my legs hurt, I'm straining my back; I can't do this! I seriously can't do this!!)\r\nSuu: H-Hokuto-san, I might need a break soon, I think...\r\nHokuto: You've only done a hundred swings so far!\r\nSuu: Isn't a hundred plenty!?\r\nHokuto: Not yet!\r\nSuu: (Th-This is bad... If Hokuto-san doesn't get stopped, someone's going to die! I'm going to die!)\r\nSuu: Um, how many practice swings do I have to do for this regimen...?\r\nHokuto: Don't concern yourself with how many swings you should do, Suu. Swinging until you can no longer raise your arms is your warm-up.\r\nSuu: My warm-up!?\r\nHokuto: Yes, after that comes your real practice swings. Let's see, why don't you start with ten swings after that.\r\nSuu: ......Huh?\r\nHokuto: Ten swings, and then, if it seems like you can keep going, ten more. Keep repeating that, and you'll find your true limit.\r\nSuu: Isn't that just brute forcing it!? What happened to all that stuff you were talking about before, with sports science!?\r\nHokuto: It isn't brute force, it's a function of the brain.\r\nHokuto: Before you reach your true limit, your brain will send signals saying \"I can't go on.\"\r\nHokuto: That's why, in order to swing your okatana harder and farther than you can now, you need to drill into your brain that your limit is still even further...\r\nSuu: S-Stop! That's enough!\r\nHokuto: Is it?\r\nHokuto: Ah, and, I know it might not be interesting only doing practice swings, but don't worry. I'm watching lots of videos to study your Unkou-ryu.\r\nHokuto: I'll teach you an even more efficient training regimen.\r\nSuu: That's not making me any happier!\r\nSuu: Let's forget about this and go have fun somewhere! We finally get to see each other, so I want to enjoy it-!\r\nHokuto: ...Seems like there's no way around it. We'll end with this training for today, so, can you give it a good effort?\r\nSuu: Okay!\r\nSuu: ...Wait, but it's this training that's crazy!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: On the Cutting Board\r\n\r\nSuu: Please hide me! I'm being chased!\r\nKofuki: Huh? What?\r\nSuu: Eeeeeeeek! Aradama-Must-Die-Man!? W-W-W-W-Why are you here-?\r\nKofuki: Hey, you're the one who came barging in. This is my research lab, y'know?\r\nSuu: This place is Shichinosato-san's research lab!?\r\nTsugumi: That's wrong. This is my lab, not Shichinosato-san's.\r\nTsugumi: So then, what's the matter? You said something disturbing, like you were being chased...\r\nSuu: GYAAAAAAAAAA!! She found meee!!\r\nSuu: S-Sorry to bother you~!\r\nKofuki: The hell was that about just now.\r\nTsugumi: She was being chased by Satsuki-san?\r\n\r\nYomi: I finally caught up to you. Please come quietly and participate in the utsushi increasing program.\r\nSuu: I-I don't want to...!\r\nYomi: Please participate.\r\nSuu: It really hurts, you know...!\r\nSuu: It feels like, this is what it must be like to be a carp on a cutting board...\r\nYomi: Please participate.\r\nSuu: ......Okay.\r\n\r\nYomi: Please apply utsushi.\r\nSuu: I-I can't do it anymore~...\r\nYomi: This is only your seventh time.\r\nSuu: I-I seriously can't do it anymore!\r\nYomi: So, once again, you were unable to reach sixteen.\r\nSuu: That just happened by accident! I'm sure that seven times is my limit!\r\nYomi: In the last program, you reached eight.\r\nSuu: Urgh...\r\nYomi: Seven times is your average. However, the number fluctuates slightly. How can we reliably produce a higher number...\r\nSuu: That's what I'd like to know!\r\nYomi: ...\r\nYomi: (The time she was able to produce sixteen utsushis was when she attempted to stop Asahina-san.)\r\nYomi: (It seems that motivation is key after all. In which case, this program won't...)\r\nYomi: (No, if we are able to clearly determine that, then this program does have a purpose.)\r\nYomi: The next program will be held next week.\r\nSuu: We're still going to keep doing this!?\r\nYomi: Please do not run away next week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: To the Ones I Support!\r\n\r\nHakobune Noa: Thanks for coming today, to see Garden's event-!\r\nSuu: Noa-chaaaaaan! You're so cute again todayyyyyyyy!\r\nSonomiya Eden: We're going to kick things into highest gear today, for all of you who came to see us-!\r\nSuu: Eden-chaaaaaan!\r\nTsugumi: ...? That voice just now, I've heard it before...\r\nSuu: Whoaaaaaaaa! Garden, you're the bessssssst!!!\r\nTsugumi: That girl, she's the one who Satsuki-san was chasing, isn't she...\r\nSuu: Garden! Garden! Gar... Ah.\r\nTsugumi: (It seems like she's noticed me as well.)\r\nSuu: .........\r\nTsugumi: (That's an impressive change of expressions.)\r\nSuu: ...Wh-What a coincidence? You're the one from the lab... with Shichinosato-san, aren't you?\r\nTsugumi: Ban Tsugumi.\r\nSuu: Th-Thank you for your consideration. I'm Inami Suu.\r\nSuu: Um... Ban-san, are you here for Garden's event too?\r\nTsugumi: No, that's not it. This is the first I've heard of this \"Garden\".\r\nSuu: Of course...\r\nTsugumi: Do you like idols, Inami-san?\r\nSuu: Yes, I like smaller idols a bit.\r\nTsugumi: Why smaller ones? Is it because you hope they'll develop so they can make it big?\r\nSuu: Hoping they'll develop isn't giving them enough credit!! Plenty of the best idols are still working with low popularity!\r\nSuu: They just... never make it out of obscurity...\r\nTsugumi: You do hear that the world of idols is a harsh place.\r\nSuu: It is. Garden are on their way to making it big, but most idols disappear without managing to break out.\r\nSuu: That part of it... It sort of connects with me, and I can't help but support them.\r\nTsugumi: Is that so.\r\nTsugumi: I'm sorry to interrupt you then. Please do your best to support Garden.\r\nSuu: Ah, how about we do it together?\r\nTsugumi: No, I have to return to the research lab after this. I'll see you around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Less Than I Thought...?\r\n\r\nSuu: Sigh... Today's the day of the utsushi increasing program...\r\nYume: Yomi-onee-saaan.\r\nSuu: -!? Th-That voice was... Tsubakuro-san!!\r\nSuu: I-I have to hide!!\r\n\r\nYomi: What is it, Tsubakuro-san?\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san both went on missions, so I'm bored.\r\nYume: What are you up to, Yomi-onee-san?\r\nYomi: I have to now help with Inami-san's utsushi increasing program.\r\nYume: Inami-san? You mean... The person who's hiding over there?\r\nSuu: !?\r\nSuu: (Did she see me!? Wait, but... She might just be saying that...)\r\nYume: How long are you gonna be hiding for? Come out already.\r\nSuu: I-I'm very sorry about that-! Tsubakuro-sama-!\r\nYume: Why're you calling me Tsubakuro-sama?\r\nSuu: No no, you see, the difference between someone like me and you, Tsubakuro-sama, is night and day; I'm like a grain of rice in comparison-!\r\nYume: Really? Actually... Have I met you somewhere before?\r\nSuu: (S-So she doesn't remember me after all... But, that's actually pretty lucky! I might be able to trick her like this!!)\r\nSuu: There's no way we've met before!\r\nYume: Hmm. Well, whatever.\r\nYume: More importantly, hurry up and finish that program thingy already. Yomi-onee-san is going to come play with me!\r\nYomi: I never promised I would play with you, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Ehh, come on. It'll be fine, right, Yomi-onee-san?\r\nSuu: ......\r\nYomi: No, it won't.\r\nYume: Boooo-!\r\nSuu: (They're sort of like real sisters... So even the monstruously strong Tsubakuro-san can behave like a spoiled little girl too...)\r\nSuu: (If she's like this, maybe she's not that scary...)\r\nYume: I know! You just have to finish up that program, right? Then, I'll help you out!\r\nYume: I just have to slash up that onee-san, right!\r\nSuu: Nevermind, she's scaryyyyy!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Meeting at the Arcade\r\n\r\nSuu: Let's go have some fun!\r\nHokuto: Where's this coming from, all of a sudden?\r\nSuu: Because, with you it's always training, training, training, training... I want to have fun with you sometimes, Hokuto-san!\r\nHokuto: ...Well, you do always put in good effort, so you do need rest every now and then.\r\nSuu: Great-!! Let's go right now; let's leave straight away!\r\nHokuto: S-Suu! Don't pull me by the arm!\r\n\r\nSuu: Ah! Look at that, Hokuto-san! They have a crane game for Hell Angel Marvelous-chan!\r\nHokuto: Marvelous-chan?\r\nSuu: Yeah! It's an anime that's hugely popular among a subset of people!\r\nHokuto: Popular with a subset of people... You like that kind of thing, don't you. Like with idols.\r\nHokuto: So, are you going to get that doll?\r\nSuu: I will! Just watch me, Hokuto-san! I'll get one first try!\r\nHokuto: Give it your best shot.\r\n\r\nSuu: GAAAAAHHHH! I can't get it! The positioning's bad, and anyway, they set up the crane's arm to be way too weak!\r\nHokuto: You're getting too worked up, Suu. It's only an anime doll, isn't it?\r\nSuu: Only an anime doll?\r\nHokuto: ...Suu?\r\nSuu: Anime and games these days aren't for kids! They have deep dramatic stories too! It's Cool Japan!\r\nHokuto: Eh, ah, uh?\r\nSuu: One more time!\r\n???: Are those Marvelous-chan dolls!?\r\nHokuto: So there's another person here besides Suu who likes this anime...\r\nKanami: Mind if I join you!\r\nHokuto: -!?\r\nHokuto: (Etou Kanami-san... At the tournament, she was evenly matched with Juujou-san...)\r\nKanami: Um?\r\nHokuto: Y-Yes, what is it?\r\nKanami: Do you like Marvelous-chan too!?\r\nHokuto: Not me, but Suu... The girl playing the crane game likes it.\r\nSuu: I couldn't get it again----! Uuu... And my spending money is all...\r\nKanami: Don't worry about it!\r\nSuu: Eh?\r\nKanami: I'll get one for you too!\r\n\r\nKanami: I couldn't get any...\r\nSuu: It's not your fault, Kanami-san! The arm is way too weak on this crane game!\r\nKanami: I know, right, Suu-chan! It looked like it was about to drop down too!\r\nHokuto: Is it really that difficult?\r\nHokuto: ............\r\nHokuto: Ah, I grabbed two at the same time.\r\nHokuto: I got them...\r\nKanami/Suu: !?\r\nSuu: Y-You're amazing, Hokuto-san!\r\nHokuto: A-Am I? But, there's no point in me keeping these... Do you want them?\r\nKanami: Can we have them!?\r\nHokuto: S-Sure.\r\nKanami: Thanks a lot!\r\nSuu: I'll treasure it, Hokuto-san! ...It's so cute, isn't it, Kanami-san!\r\nKanami: Yeah, it's really cute!\r\nHokuto: ......R-Right.\r\nHokuto: (I can't see it as anything but a weird doll... Is this what's cute?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Suu Joins: Start]: How Many Can You Apply?\r\n\r\nHokuto: By the way, Suu, how many times can you apply utsushi now?\r\nSuu: You want to know how many utsushis I can do?\r\nHokuto: Yes, and whether it's gone up or not... I'm curious.\r\nHokuto: When you fought with me in Okinawa, you used it sixteen times, didn't you?\r\nSuu: That was just that one time... Wait, Hokuto-san, while we were fighting, were you keeping count of my utsushis?\r\nHokuto: I heard about it afterward. At the time, I hardly had the attention to spare.\r\nHokuto: Anyway, how much can you do? Is that your maximum? Or, are you able to apply even more now?\r\nSuu: Umm... If I had to say, that was just a freak occurrence. \r\nHokuto: A freak occurrence?\r\nSuu: Right...\r\nSuu: I've had to go through utsushi training a few times since then, but, the truth is, I can't really get past seven times...\r\nHokuto: Suu, you shouldn't hold back.\r\nSuu: I'm trying it seriously!\r\nSuu: Since they found out I could actually do a lot of utsushis, I'd be more scared to hold back during that training!\r\nHokuto: ...Alright, if you say so, then I'll believe you.\r\nHokuto: Then, do you know the reason why the number of utsushis you're able to apply has decreased?\r\nSuu: Please don't treat that like it's the norm in the first place! That time was special!\r\nSuu: But... That's right. It can normally change a little depending on my physical condition, I think?\r\nHokuto: Change a little? By how much?\r\nSuu: One or two times.\r\nHokuto: For an ordinary toji, that would be a huge issue, but for you, it's only a little...\r\nHokuto: Aside from your physical condition, can you think of any other reasons?\r\nSuu: Hmm, I can't really think of anything else.\r\nSuu: Anyway, back then, I was just fighting desperately... Even I didn't know I could use it that many times then.\r\nHokuto: Desperately...\r\nSuu: Yeah. At that time, I wasn't thinking about anything besides stopping you.\r\nHokuto: ...Maybe it has to do with feelings.\r\nSuu: Eh?\r\nHokuto: Let's have a match. We'll recreate the circumstances of that fight.\r\nSuu: .........Huh?\r\nHokuto: And also... We'd better put both your body and mind in good condition.\r\nHokuto: We'll do whatever you want. I'll go out with you.\r\nSuu: Huhhhhhhhhhhhhh!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Suu Joins: End]: Date Then Match!\r\n\r\nSuu: Here, this way! It's over here, Hokuto-san! The ice cream here is so good!\r\nSuu: Here, say ahhh!\r\nHokuto: Ahhh...? I can feed myself... Oh, it's nice and not too sweet.\r\nHokuto: Though... Is this really all you wanted to do before our match?\r\nSuu: You said you would go out with me and do anything, didn't you-?\r\nHokuto: You're right, I did.\r\nHokuto: But, I thought you wouldn't want to fight with me, so I meant it as a fair exchange...\r\nSuu: Then, go on a date with me!\r\nSuu: So now, let's move on to the next shop! Their anmitsu is delicious!\r\nHokuto: Anmitsu... Then, do they have kuzumochi as well?\r\nSuu: They should definitely have some... Hokuto-san, are you asking because you like kuzumochi?\r\nHokuto: I do. Haven't I told you?\r\nSuu: You never told me! We're changing our plans!! Let's go find a place selling tasty kuzumochi!\r\n\r\nSuu: Time sure goes fast when you're having fun...\r\nHokuto: But, after fully enjoying yourself, your body and mind are in good condition, aren't they? Rest time is over. We're resuming your training.\r\nHokuto: ...Here I come-!\r\nSuu: -!?\r\nSuu: (She's as fast as ever!? My first utsushi is already gone...)\r\nHokuto: I'm not stopping!\r\nSuu: U-Uwah!? Hokuto-san... You're serious!?\r\nHokuto: Of course I am! HAAAAA!!\r\nSuu: KH, ugh!? I keep losing utsushis...!\r\nHokuto: How long are you going to stand there taking hits? Fight back, Suu.\r\nSuu: -! E-Even if you say that... I'm doing everything I can here...!?\r\nHokuto: Quit making excuses.\r\nSuu: But...\r\nHokuto: I won't tell you to defeat me. But, show me how you've grown.\r\nSuu: Hokuto-san... I understand. I'll show you, I'll land a hit on you!\r\nSuu: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nHokuto: Big swings won't cut it!\r\nSuu: UWAHH!?\r\nHokuto: ...Next is your eighth. Will this be your limit?\r\nSuu: ...I can still apply it! I can still do it! \r\nHokuto: Then... We'll keep going! HAAAAAAAAA!\r\nSuu: KH-!\r\nHokuto: This makes nine!\r\nSuu: ([pant pant] My utsushi is about at its limit... I can't keep this up!)\r\nSuu: I can be... I can be stronger!\r\nHokuto: (Her fighting spirit is different from before...!)\r\nHokuto: Come on then, Suu!\r\nSuu: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nHokuto: A good attack... But!\r\nSuu: I'm not done yet...!\r\nSuu: ...Ah, but, my utsushi won't...\r\nHokuto: It seems like this is your limit today.\r\nSuu: Sigh... Nine times... And also, I didn't manage to get in a single hit after all...\r\nHokuto: There's nothing you could do about that.\r\nHokuto: Even though I called it a match, neither of us could be as desperate as we were then. It's significant that you were simply able to apply more than seven utsushis.\r\nHokuto: And also, you've improved since then too, Suu.\r\nSuu: I have!? I'm really improving...!\r\nHokuto: You are. Which is why, let's do our best training you. I'm going to make it even more intense than it's been so far.\r\nSuu: B-But I don't want that-!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/ee9V9yy0uqk\r\n[Pirate - Suu: Start]: After Eliminating the Aradama--\r\n\r\nAradama: AAAAA...\r\nSuu: GYAH! D-D-Don't come this way, aradama!\r\nSuu: I mean, Shichinosato-san!? Aradama! There's an aradama!? Hurry up hurry up!\r\nKofuki: I've got my own to play with here for now! Either wait it out or do something yourself!\r\nSuu: Come onnn~. You said to leave all the aradama to you; that's why I joined your team~!\r\nAradama: KSHAAAAAAA...!!\r\nSuu: ...I-It's coming!?\r\nSuu: Uwah!? Uwahh!?\r\nHiyori: Honestly... What are you even doing? Calm down and hold your okatana properly. Are you trying to get yourself hurt?\r\nSuu: ...G-Got it! Thank you so much, Juujou-san!\r\n\r\nKofuki: So, we took care of the aradama, but why're we still in the amusement park?\r\nMihono: C'mon, Fukki. You heard Ellen-san, didn't you?\r\nMihono: We're here cause somebody from the park said we could play on their new attraction to test it out!\r\nSuu: We're super lucky they're letting us play on it. \"Treasures of the Pirates\" is really popular, so it has a reputation for being hard to get onto!\r\nAkira: Dressing up like pirates and going treasure hunting sounds pretty cool.\r\nEllen: It sets a nice mood, doesn't it-. I want to hurry up and play it!\r\nMihono: So anyway, you do it with us, Fukki.\r\nMihono: Well actually, I already signed us up as the same teams we had when we were stopping the aradama just now.\r\nKofuki/Suu: ...Don't go deciding that on your own!/Why did you decide on that for us!?\r\nMihono: Eh-!?\r\n\r\nSuu: ......\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nHiyori: This \"treasure map\" the park attendant gave us... Seems like some of them are fakes.\r\nSuu: They are. Which is why, sometimes this turns into a game of fighting over \"treasure maps\" between the other teams\r\nHiyori: So that's why Ellen and Kiyoka said they'd start searching after they collect all the maps.\r\nKofuki: What a waste of time... Let's just go to the point marked on the map we've got, and if that's not it, we're done-.\r\nSuu: ......\r\nSuu: (She really... doesn't seem interested in anything besides aradama. Does Shichinosato-san not have any hobbies or anything?)\r\nKofuki: ...Nn?\r\nKofuki: What, you got a problem with that?\r\nSuu: No-! I think that could work too...!\r\nSuu: Then, let's go as quickly as possible to the place on the map!\r\nKofuki: Oi... Wait a sec. She didn't even look at the map; where's she think she's going?\r\nHiyori: ...Guess we should go after her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pirate - Suu: End]: This Was Supposed to Be All Fun and Games...!\r\n\r\nHiyori: So if we find... a pendant from an ancient pirate treasure before time runs out, we win?\r\nSuu: Yes. It looks like you also get points for stealing other team's maps, but getting a pendant is worth the most.\r\nKofuki: Aghh... Instead of treasure, could we get some aradama-chan in here~.\r\nSuu: No, no, no, no, finding the treasure would be a million times better...! And besides, didn't you beat plenty of aradama today-?\r\nKofuki: There were too many of you here, so I got even less to play with-. I'm not even close to satisfied...\r\nSuu: Ehh...\r\nHiyori: Oi... Look! Over there.\r\nSuu: Wow... That's a super realistic looking skeleton!\r\nKofuki: This must be it. Hey you, go and get the thing.\r\nSuu: Understood-. Inami Suu is setting off-.\r\n\r\nAradama: GYUUU...!\r\nSuu: GYAAH!? Something came out!?\r\nSuu: ...A-A-A-Aradamaaa!?\r\nKofuki: ...What!? After it!\r\nHiyori: I know...!\r\nKofuki: Fufufu...! You're tiny, but you're not getting away!\r\nSuu: ...Ahh! Wait, please wait...! Don't leave me alone in this place-!?\r\n\r\nMihono: That's crazy-! So Fukki, you found the treasure and even beat an aradama?\r\nKofuki: Sure, but it was so freaking small it was over in seconds.\r\nSuu: You could have come right back then... Why did you leave me there for over ten minutes...\r\nHiyori: We needed to check around to see if there were any other aradama, just to be sure.\r\nHiyori: And you had your okatana with you, didn't you?\r\nSuu: I did... In theory, I get what you're saying. In theory...\r\nKiyoka: Since it was Kofuki-san who said to leave Inami-san behind... she probably wanted to keep the aradama all to herself. She didn't even contact us or anything.\r\nHiyori: You really get her, Kiyoka.\r\nKofuki: I wanted to beat some aradama-chan, what's wrong with that? Besides, if this scaredycat was in the boat, it'd be more dangerous with her in the way.\r\nSuu: Ah, that makes sense...?\r\nKofuki: Next time we're on a mission together, I'll take care of all your ones for you. Then you won't be whining about it, right?\r\nSuu: In that case... sure.\r\nKiyoka: You can't give in to her, Inami-san.\r\nSuu: Ah...!\r\nSuu: (I don't even want to be on missions with her in the first place... Am I getting dragged into Shichinosato-san's pace little by little!?)\r\nSuu: (I have to hold tight onto myself...!)\r\nSuu: (Though I'm not even sure if I can...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/6vDEoQfMR6o\r\n[Xmas' 20 - Suu: Start]: That's Not It!\r\n\r\nSuu: Eh!?

I'm going there on a mission, not to hang out.\r\nSuu: Of course I get it! But, since it's Christmas and all, we should have some fun together!\r\nHokuto: ...You're right.\r\nHokuto: Though, we're going to be training too.\r\nSuu: Ugh... B-But, it's Christmas, right?\r\nHokuto: That doesn't have anything to do with it. Anyway, I'll be looking forward to it.\r\nSuu: ...! Okay!\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day.\r\n\r\nSuu: Ah, my arms and legs feel heavy...\r\nHokuto: Just after that?\r\nSuu: After that?

I-I haven't been skipping it or anything?\r\nHokuto: Do you mean that?\r\nSuu: Uhh...\r\nHokuto: ...Suu?\r\nSuu: I haven't!\r\nSuu: It's just, I might have been going easy on it a little...\r\nHokuto: Well that explains it. Maybe I'll have to come up with a more intense routine for you.\r\nSuu: More than this!?\r\nHokuto: If you don't want that, then do it properly.\r\nSuu: I got it...\r\nBoth: !?\r\nSuu: There's aradama, Hokuto-san!\r\nHokuto: Right...

You two were so strong back there.\r\nSuu: Eh, err, not really...\r\nHokuto: What's wrong?\r\nSuu: I didn't think anybody would be thanking me or anything, so I'm a little embarrassed...\r\nHokuto: ...It's a good thing you've worked so hard, Suu.\r\nSuu: Yeah!"}, {"paste_key": "yJyYV3hG", "title": "North and South Swordsman Record Part 2", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/yJyYV3hG", "timestamp": "", "hits": "57", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/B5DZsaFp9t0\r\n\r\n1: Joint Training... It Started...\r\n\r\nBefore the start of the Renpu Heijou Joint-Training.\r\n\r\nSuu: ...I'm overwhelmingly out of place here!\r\nHokuto: Could you not start shouting out of nowhere.\r\nSuu: But, will you... just look around!\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nSanae: .....\r\nSuu: Not only is there Juujou-san and Iwakura-san we met in Harajuku the other day...\r\nSuu: There's girls like Itomi-san, who makes sure to finish any mission you give her, and that girl who loves fighting aradama way too much... Aradama-Must-Die-Man Shichinosato-san too!\r\nHokuto: I told you not to be so loud... They'll think it's rude if they hear you. And what's Aradama-Must-Die-Man anyway?\r\nSuu: ...That's slang for her.\r\nSuu: She loves fighting aradama and stuff. To where it's impossible to wrap your head around... Isn't she sort of scary...?\r\nSuu: Please God, I'm begging you... Don't put me in the same group as her...\r\nHokuto: You're right that there are strong fighters here from both schools, but we're only here to train together. You're worrying too much.\r\nHokuto: And besides, she's another student from Renpu, the same as you.\r\nSuu: That doesn't reassure me at a--\r\nSuu: ......\r\nHokuto: ...What is it now? Why are you hiding behind me?\r\nSuu: There, over there... It's Tsubakuro-san... and Satsuki-san, from the elite guard.\r\n\r\nYume: Yomi-onee-san, do I really have to be here for this too-?\r\nYomi: You do. This is a part of our duties as the elite guard.\r\nYume: What do we have to do?\r\nYomi: We need to instruct everyone gathered here on the details of their training. Though, I believe Shidou-san and Konohana-san will handle most of that...\r\nYume: Then, you don't need me, do you? If I don't get to fight all the strong people I want, then I want to go home-!\r\n\r\nSuu: (I don't want to get involved with Tsubakuro-san... No, I don't want anything to do with anyone from the elite guard!)\r\nSuu: (Back then... When we met in Okinawa, they were way too scary...!)\r\nMaki: Well if it isn't Asahina Hokuto and Inami Suu.\r\nSuu: HYAAU!?\r\nMaki: ? What's wrong with her?\r\nHokuto: Don't worry about her, Shidou-san. Anyway, what did you need?\r\nMaki: Nothing, just thought I'd say hi to you two. I'm sure this training will be helpful for you. I hope you'll make good use of it.\r\nHokuto: Of course; we plan on it.\r\nMaki: It's about time for us to get started. Good luck out there.\r\nHokuto: She was only saying hello. You're too jumpy.\r\nSuu: That was just, an irresistible force, or more like, a synergistic effect; a lot happened...\r\n\r\nSuzuka: This training is organized to drill you on small-scale group battles, but it has one other objective. That is--\r\nSuzuka: For you to be able to clearly convey your actions and intent to your allies in a short time, so that, even if you are partnered with someone new, you can work together to dispose of aradama.\r\nMaki: If there's an increase in aradama appearances, the amount of missions will go up too. In which case, you won't only be fighting with the companions you're used to.\r\nMaki: With that situation in mind, you'll be divided into groups by lottery. Don't go swapping your results after you draw them.\r\nMaki: Twenty minutes after the groups are assembled, we'll carry out group battles!\r\nSuu: (Hokuto-san, Hokuto-san! Please let me be with Hokuto-san!)\r\nSuu: (Also, please don't let me be with anyone scary...!!)\r\n\r\nHokuto: This is how it goes sometimes.\r\nSuu: Right, I'm so glad... God granted my prayers!\r\nSuu: Or at least, half of them...\r\nKofuki: What, there's no aradama-chan here? ...This sucks.\r\nKiyoka: You shouldn't say things like that...\r\nHokuto: I'm Asahina Hokuto, first year in the Heijou Institute's high school division. Nice to meet you.\r\nSuu: ......\r\nHokuto: Come on, you say yours, Suu.\r\nSuu: I-I'm Inami Suu... second year in Renpu Girls' School's middle school division. Please go easy on me...\r\nKiyoka: Ah, you're in the same year as me, Inami-san. I'm Musumi Kiyoka. It's nice to meet you.\r\nKofuki: ...Do mine for me-.\r\nKiyoka: ...Honestly, Kofuki-san.\r\nKiyoka: This is Shichinosato Kofuki-san. She's a third year in middle school. We both work together in the Akabane swords investigation team.\r\nHokuto: So you two already know each other as well. That's good then; it should be easy for us to coordinate.\r\nKiyoka: Right. In this situation, what do you think we should go over first?\r\nHokuto: It seems, right after this, we'll be having group mock battles. So why don't we decide on our roles in battle? We'll start with choosing an attacker.\r\nKofuki: I'm not being the attacker. There's nothing fun about going up against other people.\r\nKiyoka: ...Y-You can't be like that right from the get go.\r\nKofuki: But there's no point in teams of toji fighting each other, is there? A toji's job is fighting aradama.\r\nSuu: ...I-Isn't that right?\r\nHokuto: That's true. There might be some logic to what you're saying.\r\nKofuki: Oh, nice to see you two get it.\r\nHokuto: However, being able to coordinate with one another is more important than anything. That's why I won't consider this training a waste of our time.\r\nKofuki: If that's how you feel, then you guys can do something about this yourselves.\r\nHokuto: That won't do. If you won't participate seriously, this training will lose its meaning.\r\nHokuto: And on top of that... If we aren't able to coordinate during our missions, you might be injured beyond recovery.\r\nKofuki: ...Like I'm supposed to care.\r\nSuu: Uhh, umm... Why don't we all take some deep breaths and calm down first!?\r\nKiyoka: ...Asahina-san is right, Kofuki-san. If you ended up getting hurt, I'd be upset.\r\nKofuki: ...Tch.\r\nKofuki: Fine, I get it. Let's just figure this out already.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Coordinating All of a Sudden Is... Hard to Do\r\n\r\nSuu: (The rule is that whichever group has the most people with utsushi removed loses, but everyone's going at it so seriously... It's scary.)\r\nSuu: (...I hope this ends soon. But, getting cut hurts, so I don't want that to happen...)\r\nSuu: (So, right now, this is all I can do...)\r\nSuu: --You can do it, Hokuto-san!\r\nSayaka: HAA!\r\nHokuto: Kh... She's quick!\r\nKiyoka: I'll be right--\r\nSanae: I'm not letting you go, Musumi-san!\r\nKiyoka: Eh, when did you...!?\r\nSanae: Now's our chance!\r\nTsugumi: Understood.\r\nKofuki: You're actually taking this seriously... Really?\r\nTsugumi: That's rude. I'm fundamentally a serious person, aren't I?\r\nTsugumi: It would be a problem if they didn't think I was serious and our research funding was reduced-.\r\nTsugumi: Though, you're not my opponent now anyway, Shichinosato-san.\r\nHokuto: ...Suu, stand firm!\r\nSuu: Thinking about it, they have to be coming after me, right--!?\r\nTsugumi: Sorry about this. Anyway.\r\nSuu: NOOOOOO!?\r\n\r\nSuu: Even with utsushi, it still hurts... Uuu...\r\nKiyoka: I know what you mean... It sure hurts, doesn't it. When you're being slashed, you can't help but flinch against it.\r\nSuu: Ahh, I'm so glad someone here understands! Thank you, Musumi-san!\r\nSuu: I can't be useful at all, so I... I'm thinking of withdrawing from this. I feel like that's the best way for me to contribute!\r\nKiyoka: Eh... P-Please, hold on a minute!? We'll be in trouble without you, Inami-san!\r\nKiyoka: And also, this is just a maybe, but... If Kofuki-san and Asahina-san can't coordinate, then this group won't...\r\nSuu: ...Right.\r\nHokuto: ......\r\nKiyoka: If you won't cooperate some more, we won't be able to practice anything...\r\nKofuki: There's no aradama-chan here, so no thanks-.\r\nKiyoka: ...But, didn't you say you understood that before?\r\nHokuto: ......\r\nSuu: (Ah-... I think Hokuto-san's mad... I'm not even the one who made her mad, but I'm feeling sort of uneasy.)\r\nSuu: (I wish that someone would step in and reconcile this... Even someone from the elite guard would be fine, just, won't someone stop them?)\r\nYume: Nn-? Huh, Onee-san?\r\nSuu: Ah, I didn't mean it after all!\r\nYume: Didn't mean what?\r\nSuu: ...It's nothing.\r\nYume: I think I might've seen you before. Did we meet somewhere, Onee-san?\r\nSuu: Ehh-... Ahh-... Umm-... Uhh-...\r\nSuu: (What should I do, what should I do... Maybe it'd be fine if I said honestly, we met last year in Okinawa? But, but, if I pretend like she's got the wrong person, maybe she'll lose interest and go away!?)\r\nYume: I can't tell what you mean when you just say \"Uhh-...\", Onee-san.\r\nSuu: Th-There's no way we could have met anywhere before, Tsubakuro-sama...\r\nYume: Why're you calling me Tsubakuro-sama even though I'm younger? Wait, this feels familiar for some reason...\r\nSuu: AWAWA...! Umm, umm... It looks like you elite guard are having another tough day of work, huh!\r\nYume: Not really-... There's nothing to do, so I'm just bored. It's not like I get to fight anybody strong either-.\r\nYume: I'm tired of this, so I'm going to go play with Yukari-sama! Bye bye~.\r\nSuu: Tsubakuro-san... You're as free spirited as ever... I'm jealous...\r\nAnnouncer: We are beginning the next match, so will the following groups please prepare straight away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: How Did it Come to This...?\r\n\r\nMaki: So each group has gone through a number of battle exercises at this point. Hm...\r\nMaki: (Though, there's groups that are coordinating well, and those that aren't. The difference is greater than I was expecting.)\r\nMaki: (Even when you gather nothing but people greatly skilled at fighting, they might not function properly as a team in some cases.)\r\nMaki: (Asahina and Shichinosato's coordination is going to take time to improve, won't it...)\r\nMaki: (Getting rid of ignorance within a unit is another part of this training's goals. I'll watch them carefully for now.)\r\n\r\nSuu: We lost again, didn't we...\r\nKofuki: The hell, I fought like you told me to, didn't I? And anyway, she's barely fighting worth anything either.\r\nSuu: Ah, that's true...\r\nKiyoka: Hey... Kofuki-san!\r\nKiyoka: U-Um... Try not to let it get you down, Inami-san.\r\nHokuto: It's true that, with how fearful Suu is acting, I can't call her an asset to the team.\r\nHokuto: Even when I put her through training whenever we meet, I wouldn't say she's very enthusiastic.\r\nSuu: Hokuto-san, even if it's true, when you say it out loud... You're making me depressed.\r\nHokuto: But, you should be capable of fighting harder than that. Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: Yeah and, what about it?\r\nHokuto: I understand full well that you won't get serious unless you're fighting against aradama.\r\nHokuto: However, I'd hate it if this training went on like this. We were given the chance to participate, so I don't want it to go to waste.\r\nHokuto: Which is why...\r\n\r\nSuu: They did! At first, Noa-chan and Eden-san used to be so serious about their idol activities, and apparently they got in lots of arguments over where to take their careers.\r\nSuu: They said that, in order to decide who'd lead them, they had a bunch of battles, like, who could get the highest score in karaoke, or who could hold a smile the longest.\r\nSuu: But, as they did that, it made them start understanding each other better! Isn't that so idol-like!\r\nHokuto: I don't exactly know... what is and isn't idol-like. But it's true that battling can be a way to bring people together.\r\n\r\nHokuto: ...Let's settle this with a match. What do you say we agree the loser will obey the winner for the remainder of this training?\r\nKofuki: ...Huh?\r\nHokuto: If you win, I won't complain.\r\nKofuki: Have you got muscles for brains or what...?\r\nKofuki: But, fine. If I win, then this lameass argument's done with too.\r\nSuu: E-Eh... Is it really okay for you to duel like this?\r\nHokuto: It's not a duel. This is simply practice in the form of a standard match. Move away.\r\nSuu: You can't go pushing yourself too hard just because your leg injury healed.\r\nHokuto: Thank you. I know.\r\nKiyoka: You could have just done the practice properly.\r\nKofuki: It's fine.\r\nKofuki: Let's get this started already.\r\nHokuto: I'm ready anytime.\r\nKofuki: Then I'll get right to it--!\r\nHokuto: You are strong... But!\r\nHokuto: --HAAA!\r\nKofuki: Tch...\r\nSuu: What's going to happen...\r\nKiyoka: ...Mm.\r\n\r\nYomi: It seems like some people have started a match on their own...\r\nMaki: Wait, just leave them for now. If the situation gets worse, we'll step in.\r\n\r\nMaki: Hopefully this can bring about some kind of change in that group.\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san, it seems a mass outbreak of aradama has occurred in Harajuku just now.\r\nMaki: ...!\r\nSuzuka: I only just got the report. This joint-training has been changed to a joint-operation. The elite guard are to direct their suppression.\r\nMaki: Got it. Let's hurry!\r\n\r\nHokuto: It seems like now's not the time for our match.\r\nKofuki: Sounds like a whole load of aradama-chan are out there. Good thing I joined in on this training.\r\nHokuto: We'll be up against aradama, so I'll be depending on you readily.\r\nSuu: Ahhh, why did this have to happen-!?"}, {"paste_key": "vCMwz9hR", "title": "Yakisoba Journey to the West", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/vCMwz9hR", "timestamp": "", "hits": "64", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/OVegt1OsEGg\r\n\r\n1: What Puts Yukari-sama in a Good Mood?\r\n\r\nAfter the Tagitsuhime incident, the members of the elite guard began working as the Special Defense Team under Origami Akane. During one of those days...\r\n\r\nYomi: Shidou-san, all of us have arrived. What was it you wanted to discuss...\r\nMaki: Actually, when Suzuka and I were coming back from a mission today, we saw Yukari-sama for the first time in a while.\r\nYume: Ehh-, I wish I'd been there-. How's Yukari-sama doing? What'd you talk about?\r\nSuzuka: About that, she seemed busy with something, so we never spoke to her.\r\nMaki: She looked pretty tired too; maybe from the stress building up. I wonder if she's doing alright...\r\nYomi: That is worrying, isn't it.\r\nSuzuka: And, because of that, we thought of gathering us all together to discuss if there wasn't anything we could do to help her.\r\nMaki: Yume, Yomi, do either of you have any good ideas?\r\nYume: Nnn, then, how about we all go out together? If we go have fun somewhere, it'll cheer her up.\r\nMaki: Yeah, I'm sure that would give her a change of pace, but...\r\nSuzuka: Given the current situation, it it may be difficult for her to go outside.\r\nYume: Boo-. I thought that was a good idea too-.\r\nYomi: Then, what if we brought her something good to eat to raise her spirits?\r\nSuzuka: Oh, that's a fine idea. If we bought her her favorite dish as a present, I'm sure she would be delighted.\r\nYume: If we're doing that, wouldn't it be better if we made it ourselves? We'll cook it together and put our hearts in it!\r\nMaki: That sounds like it'd make her happy. Alright, let's put our skills together and cook up something so good it'll surprise Yukari-sama!\r\nSuzuka: No objections here.\r\nSuzuka: Why don't we move right to selecting a menu? Do any of you know of which dishes are Yukari-sama's favorites?\r\nYume/Yomi/Maki: ........................\r\nYume: What does Yukari-sama like to eat, anyway? I don't think I've ever asked her.\r\nMaki: Me neither... Sigh, what do we do now. Just when I thought we were really onto something.\r\nSuzuka: I know! At times like these, why not consult Akane-sama? As sisters who were raised together, she must be aware of her favorites.\r\nYomi: I thought that too, and sent Akane-sama a message just now.\r\nSuzuka: Quick thinking, Yomi-san. You always do work fast.\r\nYomi: It seems she's replied. According to Akane-sama, she likes light Japanese meals, such as fish simmered in soy sauce.\r\nMaki: Alright, light Japanese meals. Then, we'll go with the ultimate dish of fish simmered in soy sauce...\r\nYume: Wait a minute, shouldn't she be eating tasty Japanese type meals every day? If she's eating that and she's still not happy, wouldn't something else be better?\r\nSuzuka: I see, you do have a point there, Yume. Apart from light Japanese meals, what else has Yukari-sama chosen to eat...\r\nMaki: Ah-- Come to think of it, a few times, when we were working as the elite guard, there would be this strange smell like junk food in her office.\r\nYume: You mean the smell of sauce?\r\nSuzuka: If that's what you mean, I was curious about it myself.\r\nMaki: I didn't think the smell really had anything to do with Yukari-sama, so I just assumed Yume snuck in to eat croquette or something...\r\nYume: I wouldn't do that!\r\nYomi: Um, I might have seen it wrong, but once before, I did see Yukari-sama eating instant yakisoba...\r\nYume: That's it! Maybe Yukari-sama likes yakisoba?\r\nMaki: Nah, there's no way. You think Yukari-sama likes such a low class kind of food?\r\nSuzuka: Though, thinking on it further, for some reason, there were always yakisoba stalls whenever we we would go flower viewing.\r\nYomi: I was also confused why, in the storehouse among the emergency rations stockpile, there are lots of cups of instant yakisoba.\r\nYume: Ehh-, then, doesn't that settle it? Yukari-sama likes yakisoba!\r\nMaki: True, when you lay it all out like that, it's hard to call it a coincidence.\r\nMaki: Alright then, starting now, while we work on our usula missions, the Special Defense Team will plan to treat Yukari-sama to the best yakisoba!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Let's Go On a Search for the Ultimate Sauce!\r\n\r\nYume: Today's mission was a piece of cake-. Huh? Are you onee-sans done already too?\r\nMaki: Yeah, we finished up quick today, so we were moving ahead with our research into \"that\".\r\nYume: Hmm, so, did you find out anything good?\r\nYomi: We found that, while the noodles and other ingredients are important, it seems the most crucial part of yakisoba is the sauce. So, we were looking into finding the ultimate sauce.\r\nSuzuka: It seems that popular sellers are employing various techniques, like adding fruits and vegetables to their products, or blending various sauces together...\r\nMaki: During our research, we came across one major fact. It looks like a legendary yakisoba shop with the ultimate sauce is out somewhere in Kansai.\r\nYume: Then, if we get that sauce, we can make the ultimate yakisoba!? We should go there right now!\r\nMaki: Well, we'd love to, but... There don't seem to be any clear details on which shop it is.\r\nYomi: There's a limit to what you can find online or in magazines, so our only option would be to visit the area and ask around. However...\r\nSuzuka: With our usual stream of missions, traveling to Kansai simply to find a sauce would be difficult.\r\nAkane: Oh, I see you're all here. This works nicely. I have orders for the four of you to go on an expedition together. Could you please all leave for the Kansai region at once.\r\nMaki: At once? And, all of us!?\r\nYume: Akane-sama, is this really okay? This means, while we do our mission, we can look for the ultimate sauce too, right!\r\nAkane: I'm not sure what you're talking about, but, so long as you see your mission through, I won't mind if you spend the remaining time however you like. Please have a safe trip.\r\nSuzuka/Yume/Yomi/Maki: Yes ma'am!\r\n\r\nYume: We're still only in Shizuoka...? We could've gotten there right away in a bullet train, so why'd we have to take a regular train that stops everywhere?\r\nYomi: Our instructions for this assignment were to make our way towards Kansai, while eliminating aradama frequently appearing in various places along the Tokaido route.\r\nSuzuka: Come to think of it, there was a town famous for their yakisoba in the area near here, wasn't there? Why don't we stop by for a bit?\r\nMaki: We've finished our mission for today, so that's not a bad idea.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: My, with the springy noodles in such rich sauce, this is exquisite.\r\nMaki: Right? It's no wonder the town is famous for it.\r\nYume: Yeah, it's super yummy! With this, do we even have to go all the way to Kansai? Wouldn't giving Yukari-sama this yakisoba as a present be enough?\r\nMaki: No, this yakisoba is good and all, but, after coming this far, we should track down the ultimate sauce!\r\nYume: Ehh-, but, we don't even know where that shop is supposed to be in Kansai.\r\nYume: And besides, since we got the chance to come out on an expedition, wouldn't it be more fun to find a lot of strong toji in different towns and fight them! Ah, there's some local toji onee-sans over there!\r\nMaki: Ahh, Yume, wait! Seriously, the moment you take your eyes off her...\r\nSuzuka: I suppose there's no helping it. Please leave this to me.\r\nSuzuka: Yume, come on over here. I have something good for you.\r\nYume: Something good? Wow, that's such a pretty bracelet! You're giving it to me, Suzuka-onee-san?\r\nSuzuka: Of course. It was given to me by Akane-sama, but I think it would suit you better. Here, I'll put it on for you.\r\nYume: Cool-! Thanks, Suzuka-onee-san. Ah, there's another local toji over there. I'm gonna go ask her for a match!\r\nYume: What's that sound? The bracelet's making a weird noise. How do I get it to stop? Suzuka-onee-san, what's with this?\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, that bracelet has a device that knows its position with GPS, and, once it reaches a fixed distance away from me, an alarm begins to ring.\r\nYume: Huhh? What's with that? That's a violation of privacy-. I don't want this anymore. I'll give it back to you... Wait, huh? It won't come off! Why?\r\nSuzuka: It's arranged so that the lock won't come undone unless I undo it myself.\r\nYume: What? Then, that means I have to stay right next to you my whole life?\r\nSuzuka: Once we find the ultimate sauce, I'll remove it from you.\r\nYume: That's no fair-!\r\nMaki: Suzuka... So heavyhanded. And, somehow, this reminds me of an old story...\r\nSuzuka: I was inspired by Journey to the West. It's similar to the band worn around the Monkey King's head.\r\nYomi: Come to think of it, our assignment now is similar to that trip to retrieve scriptures from India in Journey to the West.\r\nYume: Hey, Yomi-onee-san, Maki-onee-san, stop being impressed with her and help me-!\r\nSuzuka: There's no harm in it. So long as you don't stray away from me, it's nothing more than a lovely little bracelet.\r\nYume: Boo-.\r\nMaki: Haha. Yume is the Monkey King, and Suzuka is Tripitaka; you're right, it fits perfectly!\r\nMaki: ...Ah-! Wait, then does that make me Pigsy or Sandy!?\r\nMaki: A pig or a kappa... Neither of them sounds great... Pig, kappa. Pig...\r\nSuzuka: Oh, in the time we've spent here, an aradama appeared! Come along, Pigsy, this is no time for your grumbling. We're going!\r\nMaki: I-I'm Pigsy!? The pig monster, Pigsy...\r\nYume: I think I lucked out getting to be the Monkey King! Ahaha, let's go, Pigsy-onee-san!\r\nMaki: Pigsy... Me, of all people...\r\nYomi: Which would mean, I'm Sandy... Is that right...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Onward, to the Town Where You Eat Till You Drop!\r\n\r\nMaki: I'm the pig, Pigsy... I ended up the reincarnated pig, Pigsy...\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san? Maki-san!!\r\nMaki: Ah-! Sorry about that; I got lost in thought... Where are we now?\r\nSuzuka: We've arrived in Osaka. As it's the heart of the Kansai region, I think it would smart of us to ask around.\r\nYomi: Maybe it would be best if we started by splitting up to find information on the ultimate sauce.\r\nYume: Okaaay. Though, I can't be away from Suzuka-onee-san right now.\r\nSuzuka: That's true. So then, why don't we split into two groups. Yomi-san, could I ask you to pair with Maki-san?\r\nYomi: Understood. Then, the two of us will begin asking mainly in the area on the other side of the bridge.\r\nMaki: Right.\r\n\r\nYomi: Sorry for the wait. Did your group find out anything?\r\nSuzuka: I requested the assistance of a local toji, but she hasn't yet gotten back to me.\r\nSuzuka: Hm? Yomi-san, I don't see Maki-san anywhere. Was she with you?\r\nYomi: Shidou-san is on the bench over there...\r\nMaki: Urp, sorry. I should have known better...\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san, what happened!? Your belly's bulging out!\r\nYomi: As we asked around the various shops, she ate the takoyaki, yakisoba, okonomiyaki; whatever they reccomended her...\r\nMaki: Yeah, I couldn't refuse, and then...\r\nYume: I know they call this the town where you eat till you drop, but you didn't have to really do it! You seriously are Pigsy, Maki-onee-san!\r\nMaki: Kh... Still though, maybe you're right calling me that, Yume.\r\nMaki: Alright, if this is what it comes down to, Shidou Maki's going to own up to it and take on the role of Pigsy!\r\nSuzuka: Well now, as soon as you accepted it, your strength came back to you.\r\nMaki: That's right. I'm the man with total destructive power, Pigsy. When I think that, how could overeating slow me down!\r\nMaki: Watch me, I'll obtain the ultimate sauce that glitters like the holy scriptures, make the finest yakisoba, and defeat the Ox King Yukari-sama!\r\nYume: Weren't we going to cheer Yukari-sama up, not beat her up...?\r\nYomi: We were. And also, the Ox King is a villain in Journey to the West who gets in the way of the protagonists goals... I don't think that should be Yukari-sama's position...\r\nSuzuka: Oh, this call is from the local toji I mentioned. Hello... Really! I see, thank you very much.\r\nYume: Suzuka-onee-san, what'd they say?\r\nSuzuka: They went searching around, and seem to have found the stand with the ultimate sauce!\r\nMaki: If we go to this stand, we can get the ultimate sauce for ourselves! So, where is it?\r\nSuzuka: She sent me a map. Oh my, it's right near here. Let's go see!\r\n\r\nSuzuka: This should be the yakisoba stand, according to the map. Pardon us.\r\nMaki: There's something we want to ask you about. Actually, we want to take some of your shop's yakisoba sauce...\r\nShopkeeper: Huh? What're you ladies going on about? I'm not about to hand over my secret sauce just like that.\r\nSuzuka: We would appreciate it if you found some way to. We've come all the way from Kanto searching for that sauce.\r\nYomi: If not the sauce, would it be possible for you to at least teach us the recipe? We'll of course keep it a strict secret.\r\nShopkeeper: I don't care where you came out from! There's no way I'm giving up this sauce, and I'm not telling you the recipe either.\r\nMaki: Kh, we found the shop, but it looks like here's where the real challenge starts.\r\nSuzuka: It appears our final adversary wasn't the Ox King Yukari-sama, but this shopkeeper all along...\r\nYomi: Should we retreat for now and work out a way to negotiate?\r\nShopkeeper: Damnit, those things showed up again. There's a limit to how much you can get in the way of my business!\r\nSuzuka: Mr. Shopkeep, please leave this to us. Now, let's get the customers to someplace safe.\r\nShopkeeper: Ah, might you girls be...\r\nMaki: We're toji who came all the way out from Kanto to exterminate aradama.\r\nYume: We're super strong too, so just wait and relax! Let's go, everyone-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: What We Found at the End of Our Journey Was...\r\n\r\nAradama: GUOOOOO...\r\nMaki: Didn't take an instant to deal with them. Everyone, it's safe to come out now.\r\nShopkeeper: You girls were toji, were you? Thanks, for keeping shop and the customers safe.\r\nSuzuka: No, we only did what was expected of us as toji. What matters most is that the shop and everyone were unharmed.\r\nShopkeeper: Sorry about before. Here, as thanks for what you've done today, would you want to take this?\r\nMaki: This is the ultimate sauce!\r\nYume: Can we? Really!? Nice-! We actually got the sauce!\r\nMaki: At last, we've defeated the Ox King and gotten our hands on the scriptures...\r\nYomi: We seem to have eliminated all the aradama in this region, so our expedition assignment is finished as well. Let's hurry back to the Origami estate.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Yomi-san, I cooked the noodles and other ingredients.\r\nYomi: After we season it with the sauce, it will be done.\r\nMaki: Now, for the ultimate sauce!\r\nYume: Wow, it smells so good! Yukari-sama'll be happy with this for sure.\r\nYukari: That's true, it does have a nice smell to it.\r\nMaki: Y-Yukari-sama!\r\nSuzuka: What brings you here?\r\nYukari: I happened to be passing by, and I heard your voices.\r\nYume: Boo-. I thought we'd get to surprise her, but she found us out right in the middle of making it.\r\nSuzuka: Isn't that still fine, Yume? This means she'll be able to savor it right as it's freshly cooked.\r\nMaki: Yukari-sama, we all made the ultimate yakisoba for you. Please, have a taste.\r\nYukari: For me...? You didn't need to go so far. Then, without delay.\r\nYukari: Mm... This is... What is this flavor!\r\nYume: Yukari-sama's really digging into it. Ah, she's already done.\r\nYukari: Phew, that was a first rate delicacy. Thank you, honestly, for preparing it for me. Though, I have business to attend to, so, if you'll excuse me.\r\nYume: Yukari-sama cheered up a little, didn't she!\r\nYomi: Yes, her expression was more relaxed than usual. Her complexion looked slightly better to me as well.\r\nMaki: So you're saying our strategy was a total success!\r\nSuzuka: Good work, everyone. This truly turned out for the best.\r\nYume: So, Suzuka-onee-san, you're going to take this bracelet off now, right?\r\nSuzuka: That's right, thank you for all your help, Yume. I'll undo the lock for you.\r\nYume: That's a relief-. I'm a free girl again!\r\nAkane: All of you, you did well on your expedition assignment. And, on top of that, thank you for offering Nee-sama a wonderful present.\r\nAkane: She seemed happy with the yakisoba, but she was also glad you were able to refresh yourselves on your trip.\r\nSuzuka: That we were able to refresh ourselves?\r\nAkane: Yes. To tell the truth, Nee-sama and I planned this assignment for you four as a change of pace; with how you've been so wrapped up in your daily duties and unable to to leave on expeditions.\r\nMaki: Wait, you don't mean... You're not saying Yukari-sama letting us see her looking down was a part of your plan, are you?\r\nSuzuka: And giving me that bracelet as well...\r\nAkane: Yes, Nee-sama suggested I offer that to you, so that you might enjoy your trip like in Journey to the West.\r\nYume: Ehh-, then, that means she knew from the very beginning that I'd split up from everyone?\r\nAkane: She did. Even I was a little surprised to see your trip play out just how Nee-sama envisioned.\r\nYomi: We went on that trip thinking it was for Yukari-sama's sake, but we were in the palm of her hand all along.\r\nMaki: So Yukari-sama wasn't the Ox King after all; she was playing the role of the Buddha!\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, just as one would expect of Yukari-sama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Hiyori and Sanae's Golden Week\r\n\r\nHiyori: I thought about maybe going out shopping alone for once, but now that I'm here, the crowds are as big you'd expect from the long holiday...\r\nSanae: Huh? Juujou-san!\r\nHiyori: Iwakura-san. I didn't think I'd see you here.\r\nSanae: I know. I was here buying kashiwa mochi from the dumpling seller over there.\r\nHiyori: Kashiwa mochi, huh... That's right, it's almost Boy's Day.\t[Boy's Day is one of the several holidays during Golden Week. Kashiwa mochi are traditionally served then.]\r\nSanae: Last year, with it being just before the tournament, I didn't have any time get kashiwa mochi, so I thought, this year for sure!\r\nSanae: It happens so fast, doesn't it. It's nearly been a full year since that tournament.\r\nHiyori: Yeah, the tournament is as soon as Golden Week is over...\r\nSanae: Come to think of it, do you remember, Juujou-san? We met around this same time last year, by accident just like this.\r\nHiyori: We did?\r\nSanae: Remember, we were both tired out from finishing practice, and we happened to bump into each other.\r\n\r\nHiyori: Not much longer before the tournament. It's not enough yet... I have to do everything that I can...\r\nSanae: Huh? Juujou-san. I don't often run into you around here. Are you on your way back from practice?\r\nHiyori: I was.\r\nSanae: I just finished up with my practice too. I was thinking, I might have lost to Juujou-san in the qualifiers, but I want to somehow catch up to her by the main tournament...\r\nHiyori: I see... ...Nn? What's that long herb you're holding...?\r\nSanae: Oh, it's an iris. Bathing in a bath with iris petals on Boy's Day is supposed to cleanse evil spirits, and they say it's good for victory too.\t[Boy's Day was also known as Iris Day, as it's when the irises go in bloom. The kanji for iris can be read as shoubu, for contest, and bathing with iris petals is a tradition for the reasons Sanae listed.]\r\nSanae: I thought I would use it in the bath at the dorm, as a little superstition for the tournament, but also to pray for everyone's safety.\r\nSanae: You should be sure to bathe with them too, Juujou-san, to help ward off evil.\r\n\r\nHiyori: Ahh, that did happen, didn't it.\r\nSanae: I'm glad you remember now. By the way, back then, did you actually bathe with the iris petals?\r\nHiyori: I did. The fresh grassy fragrance helped unwind my tension; it was a nice break.\r\nSanae: I see. So long as it helped you out.\r\nHiyori: Thinking back, a lot of hard things came up this past year, but the power of those irises then might have been part of what helped me stay strong through it.\r\nSanae: Fufu.\r\nSanae: That's right, for the coming year too, so that everyone can stay safe and do their best as toji, should we buy irises and bring them back?\r\nHiyori: A prayer for a safe year, huh. Not a bad idea.\r\nSanae: Then, let's get right to it and stop by a florist.\r\nHiyori: Sure. Let's buy lots, so we can fill up the dorm's bath, before we go back."}, {"paste_key": "g47z5i1V", "title": "5-1 Kashuu Kiyomitsu", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/g47z5i1V", "timestamp": "", "hits": "105", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/ME_raf6jJ3o\r\n\r\n1: We Won't Go Up a Year!?\r\n\r\nYukari: Go now with Asakura, into the boundary between this world and the netherworld, and destroy Tagitsuhime's true body, Hirukomitama.\r\nYume: Destroy Hirukomitama?\r\nYume: I don't really get it, but is that some kind of super strong enemy that only I can handle?\r\nYukari: Of course.\r\nYume: I thought so! After all, it's Tagitsuhime's true body, right! It sounds interesting! I'll do it!\r\nYume: It feels like it's finally time for us to break out the secret weapon!\r\nYukari: Whatever may happen, do not let your guard down. In both size and strength, Hirukomitama will be no ordinary foe.\r\nYukari: What's more, this operation comes with a time limit. If you are unable to defeat Hirukomitama before it makes landfall, all will be lost.\r\nYukari: And, after you have destroyed Hirukomitama, you are to return here at once. Do you understand?\r\nYume: So, the important bits are, I just have to beat it real quick and come right back, right?\r\nYukari: Yes. That's all I can ask for. You understand as well, don't you, Asakura?\r\nMihono: Huh...? But, then, what about Tagitsuhime...\r\nYukari: I'm telling you, there is no time. We have no choice but to trust Etou and Juujou with Tagitsuhime.\r\nYukari: Etou and Juujou as they are now will surely destroy Tagitsuhime! You will fulfill your own role!\r\nMihono: I just have to trust Kanami and Juujou-san then... I got it...!\r\nYume: Kashuu Kiyomitsu onee-san, don't slow me down out there, okay!\r\nMihono: Don't worry about that... Right now, I'm pretty strong too!\r\n\r\nInago Akira: ......\r\nAkira: Mihono, you seriously went up into the border between here and the netherworld... Just like Makocchan said you would.\r\n\r\nMay 2019.\r\n\r\nMihono: M-Makeup lessons are over~... Good work today, Kanami~.\r\nMihono: Also, thanks for helping us study, Mai.\r\nMai: This is about all I can do, so don't think anything of it, Mihono-chan.\r\nMai: We'll all go up a year together, for sure.\r\nMihono: Ha... Haha, hahahaha... There's still a whole year left too, and yet... That it'll be this bad, being at the level of not being able to move up a year...\r\nMihono: I mean, it's not like I think I'm really smart or anything, but, if even Fukki can move up a year...\r\nMai: I think that might be a little rude to Shichinosato-san...\r\nMai: Don't worry, it's fine. You still have a year to go, so how about we work our way back up from here?\r\nMihono: That's not gonna be easy, Mai... For Kanami either... Just look at her.\r\nKanami: ......\r\nMihono: She studied so hard she died on the inside.\r\nMai: Kanami-chan!?\r\nKanami: ...I-I'm fine, Mai-chan... It's just, after nothing but makeup lessons every day, and covering so much subject material...\r\nMihono: Kanami was totally absent for the third semester of her second year, after all.\r\nKanami: Yeah, if I didn't have Mai-chan, I wonder how things would turn out for me now...\r\nMihono: Let's repeat our third year of middle school together, Kanami!\r\nKanami: Let's do it, Mihono-chan!\r\nMai: Aren't we working so hard so you won't have to do that?\r\nKanami/Mihono: Oh, right.\r\nMihono: Okay, that's enough of the negative stuff! Let's go get some bubble tea, Kanami, Mai!\r\n\r\nKanami: Mmm~! Bubble tea's so good!\r\nMihono: You're totally hooked on bubble tea, aren't you.\r\nKanami: Of course I am, when something this yummy got popular out of nowhere!\r\nMai: Now that you mention it... In the time while you and Hiyori-chan were gone, a lot of things changed, didn't they.\r\nKanami: Yeah! I couldn't believe it when I heard Yukari-sama had retired and Akane-sama took over as the bureau director of the Sword Administration Bureau!\r\nMai: And then, changes closer to us would be, the investigation team, wouldn't it?\r\nMihono: [slurrrp]... Eh? Ah, you mean, us getting attached to the Origami family?\r\nKanami: I'm surprised you even got your own investigation room at Renpu Girls' School!\r\nMihono: I was really happy about that. We never had anything like it before, so it's like, the investigation team's home base! It's exciting.\r\nKanami: And also, you've gotten a heck of a lot stronger, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Y-You think so~?\r\nKanami: Yeah! It's so much fun facing off against you! When we get back, wanna spar?\r\nMihono: Sure thing! We've gotta exercise off the bubble tea and all!\r\nMihono: ...Ah.\r\nKanami: Is that a mission? Aradama are appearing as often as ever, aren't they.\r\nMihono: ...Yeah.\r\nMihono: Sorry, Kanami, Mai. I've gotta go.\r\nMai: Good luck out there, Mihono-chan.\r\nKanami: Take care!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Mihono's Dream\r\n\r\nMihono: HAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: ...Phew.\r\nMirja: That aradama now appears to have been the last of them. You've done well, Asakura Mihono.\r\nKofuki: Seriously!? That was nowhere near enough-!\r\nKofuki: And Mihocchi got practically all of them! Why can't you be more considerate to me, Mihocchi-!\r\nMihono: Eh? Did I really beat that many?\r\nKofuki: You did! Damnit, you took all my share.\r\nMihono: Sorry, Fukki! I was feeling stressed out after my makeup lessons, so... I couldn't help it.\r\nKofuki: Like hell you couldn't! C'mon, c'mon! Be more sorry!\r\nMihono: I said I was sorry~!\r\nKiyoka: Your makeup lessons must be difficult, right?\r\nMihono: Yeah... But, if I don't do them, they say I can't move up a year...\r\nYui: Things are going so well on the investigation team side of things too, Mihono-chan. The heavens are too cruel to grant two blessings! You might be the ace of the investigation team, but your grades are in the red... Could this be gap moe!?\r\nChie: I'm sorry, Mihono-chan. Under normal circumstances, I'd have liked to watch over and help you study, but...\r\nMihono: You don't have to treat it so seriously! So long as I do my makeup lessons right, I should be fine!\r\nMihono: And besides, you're busy with college, aren't you, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: Yes, it's a little busy right now... But, I should be able to get a bit more free time soon, so I'll help you with your studying then.\r\nMihono: Okay!\r\nMihono: Ah, oh yeah, Mirja-san. You and Kiyoka are looking into Kashuu Kiyomitsu for us, aren't you?\r\nMihono: How is that going, anyway?\r\nMirja: As of now, not well. It's enjoyable reading through the records, but we have nothing to show for it.\r\nKiyoka: That's why, we were talking about not just looking up Kashuu Kiyomitsu, but researching into the Asakura family too.\r\nMihono: My family?\r\nMirja: We seem to be at our limit with this. So we've decided to try for a slightly different approach.\r\nMirja: However, we've only just begun down that line of research, so we have nothing noteworthy to report yet.\r\nMihono: ...Oh, okay then.\r\nChie: ...Mihono-chan? Is there something on your mind?\r\nMihono: Eh!? Nothing really... Why're you asking all of a sudden, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: I just had a feeling, like you're acting a little different than usual...\r\nMihono: No way; I'm the same as I always am!\r\n\r\nMihono: (It's this same dream today...)\r\nMihono: (Of somebody heading into a sea of fire...)\r\n\r\nMihono: I had that dream again...\r\nMihono: Something on my mind... I can't really tell Chii-nee, can I. That I'm just having this weird dream over and over.\r\nMihono: But, what's this dream about, anyway... Are you showing it to me, Kiyomitsu?\r\nMihono: ......It's not like an okatana can answer me I guess.\r\n\r\nMihono: Yawn...\r\nKiyoka: Not getting enough sleep?\r\nMihono: Yeah, kind of...\r\nTsugumi: Are things going alright, Asakura-san?\r\nMihono: Ah, yeah! I'm just a little sleep deprived, so you don't have to worry about me!\r\nTsugumi: If you'd like, I could give you a drink that induces good sleep. I made it myself, and I'm fairly proud of how the calories and nutritional balance came out.\r\nMihono: I-I don't think I'll be needing that...\r\nTsugumi: Is that so.\r\nTsugumi: Then, I'll report to you the investigation team's next assignment. A new Akabane sword has been located, and the investigation team is to go recover it.\r\nKiyoka: It's been a while since we did any investigating into the Akabane swords, hasn't it?\r\nYui: That's for sure-. It's been nothing but suppressing aradama lately, so we haven't gotten anywhere with researching those.\r\nMirja: A new Akabane sword... We should leave at once.\r\nKofuki: Hold up, can I say something?\r\nMirja: What is it?\r\nKofuki: Do you need me for this?\r\nKofuki: Cause, if you don't, I'd rather go with the Special Raid Unit, y'know? I'd get to play with aradama-chan over with them.\r\nTsugumi: I see, then, please go join them, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: For real!? Never hurts to ask, huh!\r\nTsugumi: The report stated that large numbers of aradama had appeared in the area of the Akabane sword... But, I'm sure the other members will be able to deal with it.\r\nKofuki: Say that first!\r\nKofuki: Oi, what're you guys waiting for! Let's go already!\r\nMirja: I see you're still as skilled at handling her.\r\nChie: Fufu, that's for sure.\r\nChie: Anyway... Investigation team, set out to recover the Akabane sword!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Special Defense Team, All Present\r\n\r\nYukari: Enter.\r\nYomi: Please excuse me.\r\nYume: You're late, Yomi-onee-san! I was getting tired of waiting.\r\nSuzuka: It's been quite some time, Yomi-san.\r\nYomi: ......\r\nMaki: Welcome back, Yomi. Yukari-sama, the Special Defense Team is all present.\r\nYukari: I'm glad you're here.\r\nYukari: Ordinarily, Akane would be the one to deliver orders to the Special Defense Team. However...\r\nSuzuka: We understand.\r\nSuzuka: Acting as both the bureau director and head of the Origami family, Akane-sama's burden grows by the day.\r\nSuzuka: To the point where, even making time to hand down our orders would require adjusting her schedule.\r\nYukari: I need you to be Akane's strength.\r\nMaki: We will.\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYume: Yukari-sama, what kinda mission do you have for us this time? If it's suppressing aradama, I want to do it!\r\nYukari: Unfortunately, this is unrelated to aradama. Your assignment now is the investigation, as well as observation, of an extremist faction within Mokusa.\r\nYume: An extremist faction in Mokusa?\r\nYukari: In addition to the main faction of Mokusa, with Akane acting at the top, there are many smaller sub-factions.\r\nYukari: Among them, there is a faction advocating particularly radical ideals.\r\nYume: That means there's a bunch of dangerous people there, right? So, all we've gotta do is beat them.\r\nSuzuka: This won't be solved so simply.\r\nMaki: Even if they may be extremists, it doesn't make them a criminal group. They're no more than just another group within Mokusa.\r\nYume: So we can't do anything to them until they do something dangerous first... That sounds kind of annoying.\r\nSuzuka: ...Well, it certainly isn't an assignment suited for you, Yume.\r\nMaki: Everybody has things they're suited for and things they're not. I know you just joined us, but I want you to work on this, Yomi.\r\nYomi: ...Will this really be alright?\r\nMaki: Will what?\r\nYomi: With me being here, the Special Defense Team is now composed of all the former members of the elite guard.\r\nYomi: There will be people who won't approve of this.\r\nYomi: If you continue with only the three of you, there won't much protesting, will there?\r\nMaki: Whether there's three of us or four of us, people won't be happy either way. You don't have to worry about our reputation.\r\nSuzuka: We cannot change the things we've done in the past... All we can do is strive to make up for it with our actions now.\r\nYomi: ...But, I don't believe that I am wrong.\r\nYomi: Yet, still...\r\nYume: None of that really matters, Yomi-onee-san. What's important is that we're all back together.\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san...\r\nYukari: I called upon you because you are needed. Will you do it?\r\nYomi: Yukari-sama...\r\nYomi: I understand. I will accept this assignment. Which faction is it I should be monitoring?\r\nYukari: We haven't gathered enough information to pin down a name at this point. But, several factions are showing suspicious behavior, such as in their movements of funds.\r\nYukari: I'll deliver the documentation to you afterward.\r\nYomi: Yes ma'am.\r\nYukari: You three as well, I'm depending on you.\r\nAll the Special Defense Team: Yes ma'am!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Mihono Changing (1)\r\n\r\nMirja: The Akabane sword appears to have been discovered around here.\r\nKofuki: There's not a single aradama-chan in this place!! That jackass lied to me!!\r\nChie: ...That's strange. I even checked it for myself, and it's true that there were reports of large numbers of aradama appearing here.\r\nMirja: I can confirm those reports as well. It seems it would be best to proceed with caution now.\r\nKofuki: Why even bother.\r\nKofuki: If there's gonna be some aradama-chan, then that's great, but if there's not, then let's just hurry it up and go back.\r\nKofuki: C'mon, let's get that Akabane sword already. Where's it supposed to be?\r\nMirja: According to the report... It was there.\r\nMihono: Over here? I'll go check it out!\r\nMihono: Chii-nee! Mirja-saaan! I got the Akabane sword-!\r\nMirja: I'll make the report to Ban Tsugumi that we have collected the Akabane sword.\r\nMirja: In response, she sent a photo of the Akabane sword... Setouchi Chie, will you please confirm this with me?\r\nChie: ...Mm, this seems to be the one.\r\nKiyoka: I'm glad we could finish this easily... This means our mission is over, doesn't it.\r\nYui: We came all the way out here on a trip, so let's at least go pay a visit to some hot springs!\r\nMihono: There goes Yui trying to get us in the hot springs again-.\r\nYui: That's just who I am! So, what do you think? Hot springs aren't so bad every now and then, right?\r\nMihono: Thinking about it... It might be nice. I haven't been sleeping well lately...\r\nYui: For that, I reccomend hot springs! Once you get in the water, it'll improve your circulation, and you'll have no problem sleeping like a baby!\r\nMihono: Ugh, that sounds really nice right about now...\r\nKiyoka: ...That reminds me, Hono-chan. You were looking sleepy in the investigation room too, weren't you?\r\nAradama: ......\r\nKofuki: -! Kiyoka, behind you!\r\nKiyoka: Eh?\r\nMihono: She's in trouble!!\r\nKiyoka: Th-Thank you, Hono-chan.\r\nKiyoka: But...\r\nAradama: ......\r\nMihono: There's so many... Are we surrounded?\r\nMirja: I've never seen such organized behavior before. I would think there is some kind of leader behind this group...\r\nAradama: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nKiyoka: What an awful sound...\r\nYui: There's the king of the hill, or, king of the aradama... I guess?\r\nChie: More intelligent, and more capable... This will be trouble.\r\nMihono: Yeah. That aradama... It's strong.\r\nKofuki: Like it matters!\r\nKofuki: I finally get to see me some aradama-chan! Let's get right to the fun!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Mihono Changing (2)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: KYAA!\r\nYui: Are you okay, Kiyoka-chan!?\r\nKiyoka: I am... But, I can't use utsushi anymore...\r\nKofuki: ...Guess that's that. Stay behind me, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: O-Okay.\r\nKiyoka: ...Thanks a lot, Kofuki-san.\r\nKofuki: It's nothing.\r\nChie: ...What do you think we should do, Mirja?\r\nMirja: We should wait for reinforcements.\r\nMirja: I finished reporting to Ban Tsugumi that we engaged aradama. When no follow-up report arrives, she should assume our circumstances here.\r\nChie: ...I suppose that's our best option.\r\nMihono: Wait.\r\nChie: Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: An aradama like that, me and Kiyomitsu... We can beat it.\r\nChie: Now isn't the time to say things like that! Mirja is considering the whole team here...\r\nMihono: It'll be fine, Chii-nee. This is just what I need to shake off my sleepiness.\r\nMihono: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: Give me your power, Kashuu Kiyomitsu!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Disregarding Orders\r\n\r\nMihono: And this is... The end of them!\r\nAradama: GYAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: Phew... See, I told you it'd be fine, Chii-nee!\r\nChie: Mihono-chan...\r\nMirja: If you find it too hard to say, then I'll be the one to say it. Asakura Mihono, your behavior just now was hardly commendable.\r\nMihono: ...Huh?\r\nMirja: You may not have intended it, but that was a clear disregard for orders.\r\nMihono: ...But, I just thought, instead of waiting for backup, it'd be faster if I beat them...\r\nKofuki: Is this really something worth nagging her over? I do that kind of thing all the time.\r\nYui: Y-Yeah, she's right! More importantly, everyone's tired, aren't they? Let's go see those hot springs, remember!\r\nMirja: ...Let me just say this.\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono, you should be using your strength to protect your allies before you defeat your enemies.\r\nMihono: Fukki was protecting Kiyoka, wasn't she? So, I didn't have to...\r\nMirja: And what if Shichinosato Kofuki was attacked by more aradama than she could hold off alone?\r\nMirja: That was a possibility as well.\r\nMihono: Then...\r\nChie: Let's leave it at that, Mirja.\r\nMirja: But...\r\nChie: Mirja, could you please get in touch with Tsugumi-chan?\r\nMirja: ...Understood.\r\nChie: ...You all did great. We had a rough time today, so how about we wash away our tiredness in a hot spring!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Um... Thank you for before, Kofuki-san.\r\nKofuki: It's not really something you've gotta thank me for. I just did what was natural.\r\nKiyoka: Of course!\r\nMihono: What're you two talking about, Kiyoka-?\r\nKiyoka: Nothing at all, Hono-chan! Anyway, aren't you looking forward to the hot springs!\r\nMihono: Yeah! Hot springs~, hot springs~.\r\n\r\nMirja: ......\r\nMirja: Was this for the best, Setouchi Chie? Asakura Mihono is...\r\nChie: After suddenly getting a lot stronger, she can't get her mental balance right, can she.\r\nMirja: ...So you do understand. Then, why did you stop me?\r\nChie: Well... I don't think you were wrong, Mirja.\r\nChie: But... With how Mihono-chan is now, I don't think she would understand.\r\nMirja: You think she needs to suffer the consequences before she can realize it for herself? ...That's unusually harsh for you, Setouchi Chie.\r\nChie: Of course, I don't plan on neglecting her until she suffers for it.\r\nChie: If we're all careful so that she doesn't get herself hurt... I'm sure Mihono-chan will come to understand it herself.\r\nMirja: I take back what I just said. You really are too sweet on Asakura Mihono after all.\r\nChie: I am her onee-san, aren't I?\r\n\r\nMihono: Yawn...\r\nKiyoka: Ah, you yawned again.\r\nYui: Mihono-chan looks just as cute when she's yawning.\r\nKofuki: Quit making passes at her. Anyway, what're you doing that's keeping you up at night?\r\nMihono: Nngh, I'm not really doing anything.\r\nKiyoka: You say that, but I bet you're training, aren't you?\r\nMihono: I'm not, I'm not.\r\nYui: Are you chatting online?\r\nMihono: I'm not. It's just... I've sort of been having bad dreams lately.\r\nKofuki: Hmm? What kind of dreams?\r\nMihono: Uhh... I can't really remember much about it.\r\nKofuki: Well, dreams are like that. You'll stop having them sooner or later.\r\nMihono: ...Yeah, you're right.\r\nMihono: (You'll stop having them sooner or later... Yeah, that's all there is to dreams!)\r\nMihono: Okaaay! I'm gonna get in the hot springs and sleep nice and sound tonight!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Cracking Glass\r\n\r\nMihono: (Ahh... It's this again.)\r\nMihono: (Who is that anyway... Why are they going to the fire...?)\r\nAsakura Mihono?: ......\r\nMihono: (Eh, it's me!?)\r\nMihono: Gh, agh! It burns...!\r\nMihono: U-Ugh... Aghh!\r\nMihono: (The fire... It's coming into my body... I can feel it burning everywhere from the inside too...!)\r\nMihono: (It burns... It's burning...! Like I'm really burning alive...!)\r\nMihono: UWAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHHH!\r\n\r\nMihono: -!!\r\nMihono: [pant, pant]... What was that dream just now...\r\nMihono: I was being burned by the flames...? I don't get it...\r\nMihono: ...Ughh, I'm soaked with sweat...\r\nMihono: This is so gross... I should get changed and get some water...\r\n\r\nMihono: [gulp, gulp]... Phew. I think I can go back to bed now.\r\nMihono: It'd be nice if I didn't see that dream this time though...\r\nMihono: ...Huh? The glass cracked?\r\nMihono: Ah...!\r\nMihono: This is... just like when I'm using Kiyomitsu's power...!? But, why...? I don't even have my okatana with me...!\r\nMihono: Calm down... Get it under control!!\r\nMihono: [Pant pant pant]...!\r\nMihono: What's happening to me...? Why did Kiyomitsu's power come bursting out on its own!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: The Reason I Can't Sleep (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMirja: Look out, Asakura Mihono!\r\nMihono: Eh?\r\nAradama: GYAAA!!\r\nMihono: -!! Th-Thanks a lot for that, Mirja-san!\r\nMirja: Don't lose your wits in the middle of battle!!\r\nMihono: I'm sorry!\r\nKofuki: If you don't need that aradama-chan, I'll take 'em, Mihocchi!\r\nMihono: Thanks, Fukki. You saved me.\r\nKofuki: Don't mention it, Mihocchi. I'm always happy to play with some aradama-chan.\r\nMihono: Right...\r\nKiyoka: Are you not getting enough sleep again?\r\nMihono: Yeah... I'm no good like this, am I. Losing my focus in the middle of a fight; it's like I've gone back to how I used to be.\r\nYui: It's dangerous spacing out in the middle of battle, but I still love you when you're like that, Mihono-chan!\r\nChie: Mihono-chan. If anything is bothering you, I'll hear you out, but let's focus on the battle right now, okay?\r\nMihono: ...Alright. Thanks, Chii-nee.\r\nMihono: After we're done with the mission and things calm down... Can I talk to you?\r\nChie: Of course you can.\r\nKiyoka: We might not be able to help you, but we'll hear you out too.\r\nMihono: Thanks... All of you.\r\nMirja: We'll wipe out the aradama in one go, and finish this mission!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: The Reason I Can't Sleep (2)\r\n\r\nMirja: A nightmare you see nearly every night... On top of which, Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power unintentionally manifested... Then, is your power running rampant?\r\nMihono: Rampant...\r\nChie: ...And, since when has this been happening?\r\nMihono: The nightmares... I don't really know. I can't remember anymore.\r\nMihono: I think, after I started being able to use Kiyomitsu's power, that's when I first noticed it.\r\nMihono: And, when it went rampant... It was after we searched for that Akabane sword the other day.\r\nKiyoka: So that's why you haven't been getting sleep this whole time...\r\nKiyoka: Seeing the same dream over and over... That's kind of scary, isn't it. And, when it went rampant... It would be dangerous if you used hachimanriki or something by accident...\r\nMihono: I keep thinking, if I sleep, it might happen again, so I haven't been sleeping much...\r\nYui: That dream and your power going rampant, maybe it has something to do with the Akabane sword you found on that mission?\r\nMihono: I wouldn't know...\r\nChie: No, I received a report on that Akabane sword, and there was nothing that seemed related to this in it.\r\nMirja: That's right. I used kantougan to examine it as well, and it didn't have any such ability.\r\nMirja: (That reminds me, when I visited Asakura Mihono's grandfather, Mr. Yoshizumi, he seemed to believe that the tip of Kashuu Kiyomitsu was embedded in Asakura Mihono's body...)\r\nMirja: (If that wasn't a supposition, but the truth... Asakura Mihono would be someone joined with an okatana. Which would mean she is constantly at the risk of her power running rampant.)\r\nMirja: (Even so, at the very least, she must have been controlling it up until now. What would have caused that to change...?)\r\nChie: Mirja?\r\nMirja: ...Asakura Mihono. You are forbidden from fighting with your full strength.\r\nMirja: At least, until our research on Kashuu Kiyomitsu makes progress, please refrain from using Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power.\r\nMihono: I-I can handle it! I've been fighting all this time together with Kiyomitsu! And, I only lost control that one time!!\r\nChie: Mihono-chan. I think you should do what Mirja says.\r\nChie: These nightmares, and Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power running rampant. We can't be sure if these two things are linked, but... It's true that they're having a negative effect on you right now.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee...\r\nKofuki: Linked? You mean, her okatana's showing her that nightmare? I've never heard of anything like that before.\r\nKofuki: Have any of you here seen nightmares like that?\r\nKiyoka: I haven't... I don't think.\r\nYui: I really only remember having good dreams.\r\nMirja: I've never heard of it myself either, but we should proceed with the idea that there is a causal relationship in mind.\r\nMirja: Considering Asakura Mihono, I don't think it's possible for us to be too cautious with her.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMihono: (Chii-nee and Mirja-san, they're both worried about me...)\r\nMihono: (But... Kashuu Kiyomitsu, it's the okatana my mother left me. I've been fighting with it all this time...)\r\nMihono: (There's no way my partner could be something bad!)\r\nMihono: ...I got it.\r\nMihono: But, I can't just wait for the investigation to find something. I want to do something about it too!\r\nMirja: You want to do something...? I see. In that case, why not train to control Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power?\r\nMirja: Regardless of the nightmares, it should be something beneficial to you in the future.\r\nMihono: Alright!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan! I'll look through a lot of records for you, okay!\r\nMihono: Thanks, Kiyoka! I'll do all I can with training too!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: Reunion on the Raid Unit\r\n\r\nMihono: Heeeey! Kaoru-saaan! Itomi-saaan!\r\nSayaka: Kaoru. Mihono is here.\r\nKaoru: Oh-, showed up right on time, huh.\r\nKaoru: Sorry to make you help out with us on the raid unit, Mihono. You're busy with the investigation team too, right?\r\nMihono: No, I was feeling like I wanted to go out on a lot of missions, so this works out great!\r\nKaoru: Wait, were you always this serious about work?\r\nMihono: It's not really me being serious about work, but Mirja-san told me I need to be able to control Kiyomitsu's power.\r\nKaoru: Control it? Does that mean you messed up?\r\nMihono: Err, well... A little.\r\nKaoru: ...Alright. Well, do what you can. Knowing you, you'll figure something out.\r\nMihono: Right, I'll give it my best shot!\r\nSayaka: Kaoru. We should leave soon.\r\nKaoru: That's right, how about we get going.\r\nMihono: Huh? Is it just us three on this mission?\r\nSayaka: No. We'll meet with two toji at the site.\r\nMihono: Ah, okay then. What kind of toji are they, Kaoru-san?\r\nKaoru: What kind...? A habitually late delinquent, I guess.\r\nMihono: A habitually late delinquent?\r\nKaoru: Yep. She's serious deep down, but she always manages to show up late-.\r\nMihono: If she's a delinquent, is she just skipping?\r\nKaoru: Nah, she's an honest kind of person, so even if she's late, she still makes sure to show up. It's just, somehow, she always gets caught up in trouble.\r\nMihono: (She's a delinquent, but she's honest, but she shows up late a lot... Why does that sound familiar...?)\r\nKaoru: Though, it'd be pretty sad if we ended up late ourselves cause we were talking about her, so let's get out there.\r\nMihono: Ah, right!\r\n\r\nSayaka: HA-!\r\nKaoru: Looks like that's finally a quarter of them down. There's a lot more than I was thinking.\r\nSayaka: Mm. This seems like it could take more time than I thought. But, the three of us should be fine.\r\nMihono: That's for sure! ...YAAA!\r\nKaoru: Ohh, you're doing great, Mihono. How's things with your okatana?\r\nMihono: Uhh... Yeah, it seems okay.\r\nMihono: (Like Kaoru-san said, I might be doing great! Kashuu Kiyomitsu isn't showing any signs of going rampant, so I'll try holding onto this feeling!)\r\nMihono: Is that sound a motorcycle...?\r\nKaoru: Huh, she got here faster than I expected.\r\nSayaka: A Minoseki... and Ayanokouji toji?\r\nMihono: That bike, is that... Akira-san?\r\nKaoru: What, you knew her? Well, she is a Minoseki toji and all, that yankee.\r\nSayaka: Yan... kee?\r\nAkira: Oi oi, no need to start praising me up already, Kaoru.\r\nKaoru: I wasn't praising you.\r\nMihono: Akira-san, it's been a while!\r\nAkira: Yeah, long time no see, Mihono. Haven't you been working hard?\r\nAkira: I've been hearin' a lot, about all your heroics. You're a total celebrity now.\r\nMihono: Thank you very much!\r\n???: Akira-nee-sama, is this person Asakura Mihono-san?\r\nAkira: That's the one. This's Mihono.\r\nToribane Yuuki: Pleased to meet you, Asakura-san. My name is Toribane Yuuki.\r\nMihono: You can just call me Mihono, Toribane-san. Nice to meet you!\r\nYuuki: The pleasure is all mine, Mihono-san. And please just call me Yuuki.\r\nYuuki: That girl there... You're Itomi Sayaka-san, aren't you.\r\nSayaka: You can call me Sayaka.\r\nYuuki: Pleased to meet you, Sayaka-san.\r\nKaoru: The delinquent and the lady here always make a weird combo.\r\nYuuki: Should you really be saying that, when you make an odd combo with Ellen-san?\r\nSayaka: Kaoru, are you close to them?\r\nKaoru: ...Eh, it should be fine to let you know. These two are toji from Mokusa.\r\nMihono: Akira-san, you're from Mokusa!?\r\nAkira: Yep. I get told a lot I don't seem like it, but I've been with Mokusa for a real long time.\r\nMihono: I had no idea... Why did you and Yuuki join Mokusa, Akira-san?\r\nAkira: A childhood friend of mine invited us. If I get the chance, I'll introduce you to her.\r\nMihono: Okay!\r\nAkira: Anyway, how 'bout we beat the crap out of some aradama. Don't be slow following me in!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: A Widening Crack (1)\r\n\r\nYuuki: HAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nYuuki: Heh. Yuuki was trained by Akira-nee-sama herself! Aradama of this level are nothing to worry about!\r\nKaoru: (Yuuki's gotten a lot more capable. With this, things should go fine on her end.)\r\nKaoru: (Akira and Sayaka are...)\r\nAkira: ORAA!\r\nSayaka: -!!\r\nKaoru: (These two are just too reliable. Should be completely painless. As for Mihono...)\r\nAradama: UGOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\r\nMihono: Ngh!? I can take this much!\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOOO!!\r\nMihono: YAAAAA!\r\nKaoru: (She's struggling a bit? Feels like her concentration is falling off.)\r\nKaoru: (...Nn?)\r\nSayaka: Kaoru, there's more aradama again.\r\nKaoru: What are these, reinforcements...?\r\nAkira: What should we do, Kaoru?\r\nKaoru: ......\r\nYuuki: I don't think these are anything to worry ourselves over... If Mihono-san were to get serious, these aradama shouldn't be a problem at all.\r\nMihono: Y-You mean me?\r\nYuuki: That's right.\r\nYuuki: You're only not showing your full strength out of some sort of consideration, isn't that right? Akira-nee-sama told me, if Mihono-san were to fight seriously, she wasn't sure if even she could win.\r\nYuuki: And if you're that powerful, this can't be the full extent of your abilities.\r\nMihono: It's not like I'm holding back or anything! I'm making sure to fight seriously...\r\n\r\nMirja: ...Asakura Mihono. You are forbidden from fighting with your full strength.\r\nMirja: At least, until our research on Kashuu Kiyomitsu makes progress, please refrain from using Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power.\r\nMihono: I-I can handle it! I've been fighting all this time together with Kiyomitsu! And, I only lost control that one time!!\r\nChie: Mihono-chan. I think you should do what Mirja says.\r\nChie: These nightmares, and Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power running rampant. We can't be sure if these two things are linked, but... It's true that they're having a negative effect on you right now.\r\n\r\nMihono: ...I am fighting seriously.\r\nMihono: But, I'm also trying not to use Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power until I know I can control it...\r\nYuuki: Control... it?\r\nYuuki: I'm not entirely sure what you mean, but... If you're wanting to control your strength, that's all the more reason you should practice using it.\r\nKaoru: Just leave it at that, Yuuki. Mihono's got her own circumstances she's dealing with. Don't push her too much.\r\nYuuki: ...I'm very sorry. I only wanted to see Mihono-san's strength, after Akira-nee-sama gave so much approval of her... I shouldn't have bothered her.\r\nAkira: ...Sounds like you've got something going on, Mihono. It couldn't hurt, so how 'bout you tell me about it?\r\nMihono: ...Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power started running rampant. I wasn't even trying to use its power, but it started coming out on its own... I broke a glass...\r\nKaoru: Your okatana's power went rampant...?\r\nSayaka: Kaoru?\r\nKaoru: Don't ask me. I've never heard of anything like that.\r\nAkira: I've... heard a story of something like that happening before.\r\nMihono: You have!?\r\nAkira: Yeah... Sounds exactly like something my buddy told me. Though, she'd only heard that story from her mom too...\r\nMihono: Akira-san, who's this buddy of yours? Is she...\r\nAkira: Slow down, Mihono. Their name's Hitakami Makoto. She's that childhood friend I was just telling you about.\r\nMihono: ...Hitakami Makoto-san.\r\nAkira: That's her. If it's Makocchan, she might be able to get you through this.\r\nKaoru: ......The Hitakami faction, huh.\r\nAkira: Mihono, you gotta trust me and use Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power. I swear we can help you.\r\nMihono: Akira-san... I got it. I'll go do it!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: A Widening Crack (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: HAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nYuuki: ...Amazing! So this is Mihono-san's power!\r\nAkira: The power of Kashuu Kiyomitsu... It's even better than I was expecting...\r\nAkira: Looks like... We weren't wrong after all.\r\nSayaka: Is that... Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power getting greater and greater?\r\nKaoru: I've got a sort of bad feeling about this... Mihono! That's enough! We'll take care of the rest of the aradama together!!\r\nMihono: ......\r\nKaoru: Mihono? Oi! Mihono!!\r\nMihono: ......\r\nKaoru: Wait, she's pointing her okatana this way...\r\nSayaka: Kaoru, it's dangerous!\r\nMihono: ......!\r\nSayaka: Urgh!? I blocked it, but... it's forceful. My hands are tingling...\r\nSayaka: Kaoru, what happened to Mihono?\r\nKaoru: Akira!\r\nAkira: ...Must've gone rampant. Yuuki, we're stopping Mihono!\r\nYuuki: Right! Understood!\r\nAkira: (Makocchan wasn't aiming to make Mihono go on a rampage. All we had to do was make sure of her power.)\r\nKaoru: Hold it!\r\nKaoru: (I don't know what they're after, but... Akira and them are interested in Mihono. If that's the case...)\r\nKaoru: ...You two don't get near her. Sayaka. We're gonna stop her. You up for it?\r\nSayaka: Of course. We'll bring Mihono back to normal!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13: Strip My Flesh to Break Your Bones\r\n\r\nMihono: ......!\r\nKaoru: Shit, Mihono's way too damn strong...!\r\nSayaka: She's fast, but also hits hard... What do we do, Kaoru?\r\nKaoru: Good question... This would go easier if someone could tough her out...\r\nAkira: Want some help?\r\nKaoru: Don't need it!!\r\nSayaka: Kaoru, it's getting desperate.\r\nKaoru: Just a little! Akira!\r\nAkira: What?\r\nKaoru: I don't want your help, but you can give me some advice! What should we be doing!?\r\nAkira: Get rid of her utsushi! After that, she'll be back to normal!\r\nKaoru: I'm trusting you on this! If you're lying... You're gonna pay!\r\nAkira: Trust me, it'll work. I wouldn't lie when my cute kouhai there's in a pinch.\r\nYuuki: Akira-nee-sama, are we really not going to lend them assistance?\r\nAkira: Kaoru's a girl of her word. And anyway, if you went out there, Mihono'd just chop you up.\r\nYuuki: ...If she cut me, I would cut her back.\r\nKaoru: If she cuts you, cut her back... Really don't want to do this, but let's go with that!\r\nKaoru: Sayaka! I'll get her attention! You use that to break her utsushi!\r\nSayaka: Understood.\r\nKaoru: Alright... Let's make this work!\r\nKaoru: This way, Mihono!! Don't go looking anywhere else!!\r\nMihono: ......\r\nKaoru: Yeah, just like that...\r\nMihono: ......!!\r\nKaoru: Gagh...!\r\nYuuki: Akira-nee-sama! She got Kaoru-san!\r\nAkira: Ahaha! Strip my flesh to break your bones, huh! Now that's fighting dirty; I like it!\r\nKaoru: Quit laughing!\r\nKaoru: Shit, this hurts...! But, I've finally got you trapped!!\r\nKaoru: Sayaka!\r\nSayaka: Mm!\r\nMihono: ......\r\nYuuki: Nee-sama, she defended against it!? Even though they managed to create an opening...!\r\nAkira: Nah, that was just another feint. She's really after...\r\nKaoru: Your back's wide open, Mihono!\r\nMihono: UAAGH!!\r\nKaoru: We got her utsushi off! She'll go back to normal now, right!?\r\nMihono: ......\r\nKaoru: Hey, the hell!? It didn't take!? Sayaka, cut her again!\r\nSayaka: ...Mihono. She's not using utsushi.\r\nKaoru: ...Huh?\r\nMihono: U-Ugh...\r\nMihono: Huh? What was I...\r\nSayaka: Mihono, are you back to normal?\r\nMihono: Itomi-san? ...Wait, Itomi-san, why's your okatana up like you're about to swing!?\r\nSayaka: I was just... about to slash you.\r\nKaoru: You can put it down now-. ...Sigh, that's finally over I guess.\r\nMihono: Uhh...? Did I do something?\r\nKaoru: You went on a full on rampage. Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power overwhelmed you and you passed out.\r\nMihono: I passed out...?\r\nSayaka: Mihono, you were strong. If Kaoru hadn't sacrificed herself, we wouldn't have won.\r\nMihono: Kaoru-san sacrificed herself!?\r\nKaoru: Don't turn me into a sacrifice. You just cut through me once.\r\nMihono: ...Then, I hurt Kaoru-san...\r\nMihono: I'm so sorry, Kaoru-san... Because of me...\r\nKaoru: I'm sorry for not being able to stop you properly either. Don't sweat it.\r\nMihono: ...Okay.\r\nAkira: That's right, this is my fault. I went and said some things I shouldn't have. Sorry about that, Mihono.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nAkira: But, it's all cleared up now. Everything's like Makocchan predicted.\r\nMihono: ...What do you mean by that?\r\nAkira: Mihono.\r\nMihono: ...Y-Yes?\r\nAkira: We know about this thing that's happening to you. You'd better prepare yourself, before it's too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: The Time Left\r\n\r\nKaoru: Akira.\r\nAkira: ......Is this about Mihono?\r\nKaoru: What the hell else!? What was all that!? I haven't heard anything about this!!\r\nAkira: ...Can't tell you.\r\nKaoru: Are you shitting me!? Mihono's a close friend of ours!!\r\nKaoru: And to you especially... What happened to her being your kouhai!?\r\nAkira: ...Even so, I can't tell you. I've got a reason I can't say anything.\r\nAkira: But...\r\nKaoru: What.\r\nAkira: You don't have to do what I tell you, but, be sure you look after Mihono.\r\nAkira: She hasn't got a lot of time."}, {"paste_key": "ZXPua3nB", "title": "North and South Swordsman Record", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/ZXPua3nB", "timestamp": "", "hits": "95", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "As this event came in 3 parts, it's separated into 3 videos.\r\nhttps://youtu.be/HVOkvuEZX5w\r\nhttps://youtu.be/B5DZsaFp9t0\r\nhttps://youtu.be/w5SUJ2yqPuo\r\n\r\n1: In Order to Overcome These Hardships!\r\n\r\nInami Suu: Hakobune Noa-chan... She's gotten better at MCing since last time, and when I went to shake her hand, she even remembered me!\r\nSuu: And Sonomiya Eden-san winked at me too; this seriously made all the painful missions I've had to go through up till now worth it-! \t[The kanji in their names are puns on Noah's Ark and the Garden of Eden]\r\nAsahina Hokuto: ......Right.\r\nSuu: They're trying so hard...\r\nSuu: You don't know how lucky we are we got tickets for such good seats. That's all thanks to you applying for the lottery for us, Hokuto-san!\r\nSuu: Ah, what did you think, anyway? About Garden's mini-live concert!\r\nHokuto: This was my first time seeing an idol concert, so it felt very fresh...\r\nSuu: I'm glad you liked it then~. I'll give you the CD and scarf towel I bought in case I could turn someone into a future fan!\r\nHokuto: Ah... Thank you. You really like those girls, don't you. I hadn't heard of these idols at all before though.\r\nSuu: Garden still has that feeling like, only those in the know know how good they are, so I'm not surprised-.\r\nSuu: Early on, the two of them both wanted to go solo, so they couldn't get along. Garden back then... You could say it was more of a wasteland.\r\nSuu: But, after all the times they fought, you can see now just how well they get together.\r\nHokuto: Even though they fought, they turned out alright?\r\nSuu: They did! At first, Noa-chan and Eden-san used to be so serious about their idol activities, and apparently they got in lots of arguments over where to take their careers.\r\nSuu: They said that, in order to decide who'd lead them, they had a bunch of battles, like, who could get the highest score in karaoke, or who could hold a smile the longest.\r\nSuu: But, as they did that, it made them start understanding each other better! Isn't that so idol-like!\r\nHokuto: I don't exactly know... what is and isn't idol-like. But it's true that battling can be a way to bring people together.\r\nSuu: That whole story was another reason why I became a fan of theirs.\r\nSuu: I want to watch over them until the day they spread their wings and make it out into the big open sky of showbiz!\r\nSuu: Doesn't seeing cute girls sing and dance just fill you with energy!\r\nHokuto: ...I think I understand you somewhat. It's the fruit of their efforts.\r\nSuu: After that... With the Renpu and Heijou joint-practice starting in three days...\r\nSuu: I think I might be able to make it... maybe... somehow.\r\nHokuto: Be more assertive. Where did the energy you got from those girls go?\r\nSuu: I already used it all up. Ever since I got assigned to be a member of this, I've been depressed... So depressed.\r\nSuu: If you weren't going to be there, I would've faked being sick to get out of it!\r\nHokuto: Don't say that so shamelessly.\r\nSuu: ...The joint-practice this time, if only it were like the Five Traditions sponsored idol event they did before, then I could've just watched all the toji who became idols...\r\nHokuto: Toji who... became idols?\r\nSuu: It's real; I'm not making it up! They all... wore costumes, and sung and danced, and they were all sparkling.\r\nSuu: And I even thought that, maybe... I might find someone new to be a fan of there.\r\nHokuto: ...I see.\r\nSuu: I've got it! Why don't we go have fun somewhere tomorrow, so I can make it through the tough practice?\r\nHokuto: What are you saying? Tomorrow we're going to be training for the practice.\r\nHokuto: I came up with the perfect training regimen for you, Suu.\r\nSuu: Ehhhhh!\r\nSuu: Why do I have to do training before the practice though... You'll make me die from exhaustion.\r\nHokuto: You won't have to worry. I took into account your stamina and muscle mass while making this regimen.\r\nSuu: Hokuto-san, you'd go that far... for me.\r\nSuu: But that doesn't mean I have to do it... Right!?\r\nHokuto: ...I went along with you to your event, so join me in training for a while. Just a little while is fine.\r\nSuu: Ahh-... I don't want to go to training or to practice.\r\nHokuto: An aradama signal...?\r\n\r\nPeople on the Streets: A-ARADAMAAAA!?\r\nHokuto: ...!\r\nAradama: ...GRRUUU!\r\nHokuto: We're going... Suu.\r\nSuu: C-Can't we at least wait for the toji in charge of the area to show up? Let's do that!\r\nHokuto: We can't. We mustn't turn a blind eye to aradama. Even if I have to go alone... I'm going.\r\nSuu: Ahh-, fine~~... I-I got it. I got it, okay, so please, don't go off on your ownnn...!\r\nHokuto: Thank you. Let's hurry.\r\n\r\nHokuto: HAA!\r\nAradama: ......\r\nHokuto: Kh... There are too many people... This could be bad.\r\nSuu: Hokutoo-saaaan... I can't go on any more-.\r\nHokuto: Once backup arrives, this will be easier... Just hold out a little longer. You can still use utsushi, can't you?\r\nSuu: You said that a while ago~~...\r\nAradama: ...GUGGGGI!\r\nSuu: Awawawa... There's a really big one coming our way-!?\r\nSanae: We're here to support you!\r\nSuu: !!\r\nSuu: Th-Thank you so much, thank you so much...!\r\nHiyori: Iwakura-san, let's stop that aradama from moving first.\r\nSanae: That would reduce the damage the most, wouldn't it.\r\nAradama: ...GUOOOOOOO!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: This Was Supposed to Be My Day off to Recharge...\r\n\r\nSanae: --There!\r\nAradama: ooo...!!\r\nHiyori: --HAAAAAH!\r\nHokuto: Those two, we fought in the tournament qualifiers...\r\nSuu: If some strong girls are here, then we should leave it to them and evacuate!\r\nHokuto: I don't think that's going to happen. Don't lose heart now.\r\nAradama: GRRRUUU...!\r\nSuu: Why do they just keep coming one after the other...!?\r\nHokuto: We can't afford to leave everything to just those two.\r\nHokuto: YAAAAA-!\r\nAradama: ...uuuu!!\r\nSanae: Great job.\r\nSanae: Um, would you mind making a makeshift team with the four of us, to stop the aradama together? If we cooperate, I'm sure things will go more safely.\r\nHokuto: I'd be glad to.\r\nSuu: I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't count me as part of that-!\r\nSanae: Err, but that's...\r\nHokuto: The four of us will fight.\r\nSuu: Hey!?\r\nSanae: Then, Asahina-san and Juujou-san will respond to aradama as they appear.\r\nSanae: And, I'll go with the girl from Renpu, um...\r\nSuu: It's... Inami. But, just to be clear, I'm not any good at fighting!\r\nSanae: Mm, that's fine. Inami-san and I will watch for any coming from the rear or your blind spots, and support the two in the vanguard.\r\nSanae: Also, we need to help with evacuations. There should be people who couldn't get away in time.\r\nSanae: That's the basic plan of action, but what do you think?\r\nSuu: I feel like I should be the one evacuating right about now, but... I think I can do that...\r\nHokuto: I don't see an issue with that either.\r\nHiyori: Then, I'll be in your care.\r\nHokuto: Of course, likewise.\r\nHiyori: ! ...Looks like a new one showed up.\r\nAradama: ...GGGIII!\r\nSanae: Inami-san. Let's leave that aradama to them for now and watch the perimeter!\r\nSuu: I want to run I want to run I want to run I want to run... Uuuu...!\r\nSuu: ...Maybe another toji will happen to be passing by and swap with me!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Before I Knew it, I was With Three Heijou Institute Girls!\r\n\r\nHokuto: There were quite a lot of aradama, weren't there.\r\nSuu: S... So tireddd... I was looking forward to this day off too...\r\nSanae: You did well. The toji in charge of the area are here, and the noro is being collected, so everything will be fine now.\r\nSanae: Thankfully, almost none of the people who came to enjoy Harajuku were hurt either.\r\nHokuto: Having your support made a huge difference, Juujou-san, Iwakura-san.\r\nSanae: I think it's more because of how quickly you two engaged the aradama, Asahina-san.\r\nSuu: Umm-, do you three all know each other?\r\nHokuto: I know these two. Though...\r\nHiyori: I remember you too. We faced each other in the tournament qualifiers, after all.\r\nHokuto: ...You remember that?\r\nHiyori: Sure I do. You left an impression on me.\r\nSanae: And, I knew you long before we competed in the qualifiers.\r\nHokuto: You too, Iwakura-san...? I don't think we've ever spoken though. We haven't ever been on a mission together either.\r\nSanae: You're pretty famous around Heijou, Asahina-san.\r\nSanae: I hear a lot about the hard working senpai one year above us who spends an incredible amount of time training.\r\nHokuto: Ahh, that's why. I don't push myself as hard as I used to though.\r\nSuu: No no no, you still train more than enough, Hokuto-san! I feel like, if I didn't ask you to come out with me, you'd be stuck training again.\r\nHokuto: What makes you think that...\r\nSuu: Cause, every time we get together, you're always trying to get me to practice with you, aren't you!?\r\nHokuto: That's because you show a lot of promise, Suu. If you train properly, I know you'll become much stronger.\r\nSuu: ...But, it's not like I want to be stronger.\r\nHokuto: Wouldn't that be a waste of your talents? You were chosen to be a part of this joint-practice as well, weren't you?\r\nSuu: That must've been a mistake... It has to be.\r\nHiyori: You got selected too, Inami? Then that means all four of us will be at the practice.\r\nSanae: That's right. Since we'll all be together, why don't we go get some ice cream for now?\r\nSanae: There's a shop I was thinking of visiting before we ran into the aradama.\r\nSuu: Ah, I'd love to go! This is how a day off should be!\r\n\r\nHokuto: With this many flavors... It's hard coming to a decision.\r\nHiyori: I recommend the chocolate mint then.\r\nHiyori: Ah, I mean, only if you're not sure. It's just my suggestion...\r\nHokuto: Thank you. I'll give it a try.\r\nSuu: This mixed berry is so good~~!\r\nSanae: We were saying, next time we have a chance to come to Tokyo together, we had to come here.\r\nHiyori: I'm glad we came.\r\nHokuto: I've never really had chocolate mint before, but I think I might like this quite a bit.\r\nSuu: They've been having chocolate mint flavored sweets in convenience stores and places a lot lately, haven't they?\r\nHiyori: ! Yeah, that's for sure.\r\nHiyori: There really are some people who get it out there.\r\nHokuto: By the way, have you two heard what exactly we'll be doing in this joint-practice?\r\nSuu: Ah! Why didn't you ask me about that-?\r\nHokuto: Well, you... You wouldn't have closely read over the notice and paperwork, would you?\r\nSuu: I did read them though...! I wanted to see if there was anything scary sounding, or dangerous!\r\nSuu: There wasn't a lot explained in them though...\r\nSanae: I read through the paperwork after I was selected too, but it didn't say much, other than that its purpose was to strengthen our coordination.\r\nSanae: By the way, I couldn't help but notice, but, even though you come from different schools, you two are awfully close, aren't you.\r\nSuu: We are! Every time Hokuto-san is in town, we go out to have a good time, like we were doing today!\r\nHokuto: ...Though I just keep Suu company.\r\nHiyori: Well... That kind of thing happens, even between girls from different schools...\r\nSanae: Fufu, I think it's really nice to be like that.\r\nHokuto: I do too.\r\nSuu: Ahh... Anyway, about the practice... I wonder what we'll be doing...\r\nSuu: Even if I know what we're doing, if I don't like it, I won't like it. But, not knowing what we'll be doing is scary... It's way too scary!\r\nSanae: I think I understand a little how you're feeling. But, if we just keep focused and work at it, it shouldn't be anything that'll hurt us.\r\nSuu: It's hard enough just trying not to get hurt...\r\nHokuto: Suu. After coming this far, resolve yourself to see it through.\r\nSuu: ......\r\nHokuto: If, in three days, either of you get paired with Suu at the joint-practice, please look after her.\r\nHiyori: Sure, if we're together.\r\nSanae: Of course, now that we've gotten to know each other here. Let's look after each other, Inami-san.\r\nSuu: ............Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Joint Training... It Started...\r\n\r\nBefore the start of the Renpu Heijou Joint-Training.\r\n\r\nSuu: ...I'm overwhelmingly out of place here!\r\nHokuto: Could you not start shouting out of nowhere.\r\nSuu: But, will you... just look around!\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nSanae: .....\r\nSuu: Not only is there Juujou-san and Iwakura-san we met in Harajuku the other day...\r\nSuu: There's girls like Itomi-san, who makes sure to finish any mission you give her, and that girl who loves fighting aradama way too much... Aradama-Must-Die-Man Shichinosato-san too!\r\nHokuto: I told you not to be so loud... They'll think it's rude if they hear you. And what's Aradama-Must-Die-Man anyway?\r\nSuu: ...That's slang for her.\r\nSuu: She loves fighting aradama and stuff. To where it's impossible to wrap your head around... Isn't she sort of scary...?\r\nSuu: Please God, I'm begging you... Don't put me in the same group as her...\r\nHokuto: You're right that there are strong fighters here from both schools, but we're only here to train together. You're worrying too much.\r\nHokuto: And besides, she's another student from Renpu, the same as you.\r\nSuu: That doesn't reassure me at a--\r\nSuu: ......\r\nHokuto: ...What is it now? Why are you hiding behind me?\r\nSuu: There, over there... It's Tsubakuro-san... and Satsuki-san, from the elite guard.\r\n\r\nYume: Yomi-onee-san, do I really have to be here for this too-?\r\nYomi: You do. This is a part of our duties as the elite guard.\r\nYume: What do we have to do?\r\nYomi: We need to instruct everyone gathered here on the details of their training. Though, I believe Shidou-san and Konohana-san will handle most of that...\r\nYume: Then, you don't need me, do you? If I don't get to fight all the strong people I want, then I want to go home-!\r\n\r\nSuu: (I don't want to get involved with Tsubakuro-san... No, I don't want anything to do with anyone from the elite guard!)\r\nSuu: (Back then... When we met in Okinawa, they were way too scary...!)\r\nMaki: Well if it isn't Asahina Hokuto and Inami Suu.\r\nSuu: HYAAU!?\r\nMaki: ? What's wrong with her?\r\nHokuto: Don't worry about her, Shidou-san. Anyway, what did you need?\r\nMaki: Nothing, just thought I'd say hi to you two. I'm sure this training will be helpful for you. I hope you'll make good use of it.\r\nHokuto: Of course; we plan on it.\r\nMaki: It's about time for us to get started. Good luck out there.\r\nHokuto: She was only saying hello. You're too jumpy.\r\nSuu: That was just, an irresistible force, or more like, a synergistic effect; a lot happened...\r\n\r\nSuzuka: This training is organized to drill you on small-scale group battles, but it has one other objective. That is--\r\nSuzuka: For you to be able to clearly convey your actions and intent to your allies in a short time, so that, even if you are partnered with someone new, you can work together to dispose of aradama.\r\nMaki: If there's an increase in aradama appearances, the amount of missions will go up too. In which case, you won't only be fighting with the companions you're used to.\r\nMaki: With that situation in mind, you'll be divided into groups by lottery. Don't go swapping your results after you draw them.\r\nMaki: Twenty minutes after the groups are assembled, we'll carry out group battles!\r\nSuu: (Hokuto-san, Hokuto-san! Please let me be with Hokuto-san!)\r\nSuu: (Also, please don't let me be with anyone scary...!!)\r\n\r\nHokuto: This is how it goes sometimes.\r\nSuu: Right, I'm so glad... God granted my prayers!\r\nSuu: Or at least, half of them...\r\nKofuki: What, there's no aradama-chan here? ...This sucks.\r\nKiyoka: You shouldn't say things like that...\r\nHokuto: I'm Asahina Hokuto, first year in the Heijou Institute's high school division. Nice to meet you.\r\nSuu: ......\r\nHokuto: Come on, you say yours, Suu.\r\nSuu: I-I'm Inami Suu... second year in Renpu Girls' School's middle school division. Please go easy on me...\r\nKiyoka: Ah, you're in the same year as me, Inami-san. I'm Musumi Kiyoka. It's nice to meet you.\r\nKofuki: ...Do mine for me-.\r\nKiyoka: ...Honestly, Kofuki-san.\r\nKiyoka: This is Shichinosato Kofuki-san. She's a third year in middle school. We both work together in the Akabane swords investigation team.\r\nHokuto: So you two already know each other as well. That's good then; it should be easy for us to coordinate.\r\nKiyoka: Right. In this situation, what do you think we should go over first?\r\nHokuto: It seems, right after this, we'll be having group mock battles. So why don't we decide on our roles in battle? We'll start with choosing an attacker.\r\nKofuki: I'm not being the attacker. There's nothing fun about going up against other people.\r\nKiyoka: ...Y-You can't be like that right from the get go.\r\nKofuki: But there's no point in teams of toji fighting each other, is there? A toji's job is fighting aradama.\r\nSuu: ...I-Isn't that right?\r\nHokuto: That's true. There might be some logic to what you're saying.\r\nKofuki: Oh, nice to see you two get it.\r\nHokuto: However, being able to coordinate with one another is more important than anything. That's why I won't consider this training a waste of our time.\r\nKofuki: If that's how you feel, then you guys can do something about this yourselves.\r\nHokuto: That won't do. If you won't participate seriously, this training will lose its meaning.\r\nHokuto: And on top of that... If we aren't able to coordinate during our missions, you might be injured beyond recovery.\r\nKofuki: ...Like I'm supposed to care.\r\nSuu: Uhh, umm... Why don't we all take some deep breaths and calm down first!?\r\nKiyoka: ...Asahina-san is right, Kofuki-san. If you ended up getting hurt, I'd be upset.\r\nKofuki: ...Tch.\r\nKofuki: Fine, I get it. Let's just figure this out already.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Coordinating All of a Sudden Is... Hard to Do\r\n\r\nSuu: (The rule is that whichever group has the most people with utsushi removed loses, but everyone's going at it so seriously... It's scary.)\r\nSuu: (...I hope this ends soon. But, getting cut hurts, so I don't want that to happen...)\r\nSuu: (So, right now, this is all I can do...)\r\nSuu: --You can do it, Hokuto-san!\r\nSayaka: HAA!\r\nHokuto: Kh... She's quick!\r\nKiyoka: I'll be right--\r\nSanae: I'm not letting you go, Musumi-san!\r\nKiyoka: Eh, when did you...!?\r\nSanae: Now's our chance!\r\nTsugumi: Understood.\r\nKofuki: You're actually taking this seriously... Really?\r\nTsugumi: That's rude. I'm fundamentally a serious person, aren't I?\r\nTsugumi: It would be a problem if they didn't think I was serious and our research funding was reduced-.\r\nTsugumi: Though, you're not my opponent now anyway, Shichinosato-san.\r\nHokuto: ...Suu, stand firm!\r\nSuu: Thinking about it, they have to be coming after me, right--!?\r\nTsugumi: Sorry about this. Anyway.\r\nSuu: NOOOOOO!?\r\n\r\nSuu: Even with utsushi, it still hurts... Uuu...\r\nKiyoka: I know what you mean... It sure hurts, doesn't it. When you're being slashed, you can't help but flinch against it.\r\nSuu: Ahh, I'm so glad someone here understands! Thank you, Musumi-san!\r\nSuu: I can't be useful at all, so I... I'm thinking of withdrawing from this. I feel like that's the best way for me to contribute!\r\nKiyoka: Eh... P-Please, hold on a minute!? We'll be in trouble without you, Inami-san!\r\nKiyoka: And also, this is just a maybe, but... If Kofuki-san and Asahina-san can't coordinate, then this group won't...\r\nSuu: ...Right.\r\nHokuto: ......\r\nKiyoka: If you won't cooperate some more, we won't be able to practice anything...\r\nKofuki: There's no aradama-chan here, so no thanks-.\r\nKiyoka: ...But, didn't you say you understood that before?\r\nHokuto: ......\r\nSuu: (Ah-... I think Hokuto-san's mad... I'm not even the one who made her mad, but I'm feeling sort of uneasy.)\r\nSuu: (I wish that someone would step in and reconcile this... Even someone from the elite guard would be fine, just, won't someone stop them?)\r\nYume: Nn-? Huh, Onee-san?\r\nSuu: Ah, I didn't mean it after all!\r\nYume: Didn't mean what?\r\nSuu: ...It's nothing.\r\nYume: I think I might've seen you before. Did we meet somewhere, Onee-san?\r\nSuu: Ehh-... Ahh-... Umm-... Uhh-...\r\nSuu: (What should I do, what should I do... Maybe it'd be fine if I said honestly, we met last year in Okinawa? But, but, if I pretend like she's got the wrong person, maybe she'll lose interest and go away!?)\r\nYume: I can't tell what you mean when you just say \"Uhh-...\", Onee-san.\r\nSuu: Th-There's no way we could have met anywhere before, Tsubakuro-sama...\r\nYume: Why're you calling me Tsubakuro-sama even though I'm younger? Wait, this feels familiar for some reason...\r\nSuu: AWAWA...! Umm, umm... It looks like you elite guard are having another tough day of work, huh!\r\nYume: Not really-... There's nothing to do, so I'm just bored. It's not like I get to fight anybody strong either-.\r\nYume: I'm tired of this, so I'm going to go play with Yukari-sama! Bye bye~.\r\nSuu: Tsubakuro-san... You're as free spirited as ever... I'm jealous...\r\nAnnouncer: We are beginning the next match, so will the following groups please prepare straight away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: How Did it Come to This...?\r\n\r\nMaki: So each group has gone through a number of battle exercises at this point. Hm...\r\nMaki: (Though, there's groups that are coordinating well, and those that aren't. The difference is greater than I was expecting.)\r\nMaki: (Even when you gather nothing but people greatly skilled at fighting, they might not function properly as a team in some cases.)\r\nMaki: (Asahina and Shichinosato's coordination is going to take time to improve, won't it...)\r\nMaki: (Getting rid of ignorance within a unit is another part of this training's goals. I'll watch them carefully for now.)\r\n\r\nSuu: We lost again, didn't we...\r\nKofuki: The hell, I fought like you told me to, didn't I? And anyway, she's barely fighting worth anything either.\r\nSuu: Ah, that's true...\r\nKiyoka: Hey... Kofuki-san!\r\nKiyoka: U-Um... Try not to let it get you down, Inami-san.\r\nHokuto: It's true that, with how fearful Suu is acting, I can't call her an asset to the team.\r\nHokuto: Even when I put her through training whenever we meet, I wouldn't say she's very enthusiastic.\r\nSuu: Hokuto-san, even if it's true, when you say it out loud... You're making me depressed.\r\nHokuto: But, you should be capable of fighting harder than that. Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: Yeah and, what about it?\r\nHokuto: I understand full well that you won't get serious unless you're fighting against aradama.\r\nHokuto: However, I'd hate it if this training went on like this. We were given the chance to participate, so I don't want it to go to waste.\r\nHokuto: Which is why...\r\n\r\nSuu: They did! At first, Noa-chan and Eden-san used to be so serious about their idol activities, and apparently they got in lots of arguments over where to take their careers.\r\nSuu: They said that, in order to decide who'd lead them, they had a bunch of battles, like, who could get the highest score in karaoke, or who could hold a smile the longest.\r\nSuu: But, as they did that, it made them start understanding each other better! Isn't that so idol-like!\r\nHokuto: I don't exactly know... what is and isn't idol-like. But it's true that battling can be a way to bring people together.\r\n\r\nHokuto: ...Let's settle this with a match. What do you say we agree the loser will obey the winner for the remainder of this training?\r\nKofuki: ...Huh?\r\nHokuto: If you win, I won't complain.\r\nKofuki: Have you got muscles for brains or what...?\r\nKofuki: But, fine. If I win, then this lameass argument's done with too.\r\nSuu: E-Eh... Is it really okay for you to duel like this?\r\nHokuto: It's not a duel. This is simply practice in the form of a standard match. Move away.\r\nSuu: You can't go pushing yourself too hard just because your leg injury healed.\r\nHokuto: Thank you. I know.\r\nKiyoka: You could have just done the practice properly.\r\nKofuki: It's fine.\r\nKofuki: Let's get this started already.\r\nHokuto: I'm ready anytime.\r\nKofuki: Then I'll get right to it--!\r\nHokuto: You are strong... But!\r\nHokuto: --HAAA!\r\nKofuki: Tch...\r\nSuu: What's going to happen...\r\nKiyoka: ...Mm.\r\n\r\nYomi: It seems like some people have started a match on their own...\r\nMaki: Wait, just leave them for now. If the situation gets worse, we'll step in.\r\n\r\nMaki: Hopefully this can bring about some kind of change in that group.\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san, it seems a mass outbreak of aradama has occurred in Harajuku just now.\r\nMaki: ...!\r\nSuzuka: I only just got the report. This joint-training has been changed to a joint-operation. The elite guard are to direct their suppression.\r\nMaki: Got it. Let's hurry!\r\n\r\nHokuto: It seems like now's not the time for our match.\r\nKofuki: Sounds like a whole load of aradama-chan are out there. Good thing I joined in on this training.\r\nHokuto: We'll be up against aradama, so I'll be depending on you readily.\r\nSuu: Ahhh, why did this have to happen-!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Everyone's... Pretty Motivated, Aren't They?\r\n\r\nYomi: From here, you will be organized into units formed by two or three groups from the earlier practice... and undertake this mission in Harajuku.\r\nYomi: These may be hasty arrangements, but... I ask you all for your support.\r\nHiyori: ...The silver lining is this happened while we were here training. With all these people, we can take care of it quick.\r\nSayaka: Mm... I want to show what we've learned from training.\r\nSuu: Ahhh... Even though the training was hard, I thought we wouldn't be in any danger at least...\r\nSuu: Ah--!?\r\nSuu: With all these amazing people here, do they really need me? They don't need me, do they!\r\nHokuto: That won't do. This is your mission too, so you need to handle it properly.\r\nSuu: But I think I'm definitely not needed here... Sigh... It's scary; I don't want to fight any aradama.\r\nKiyoka: I understand the way you're feeling. Me too... I don't want to have to fight if I can help it.\r\nSuu: ...Musumi-san!\r\nSuu: (They give me support and they help me out; maybe I can depend on people from Heijou...?)\r\nSuu: I'll keep being in your care then!\r\nKiyoka: Nn? ...Mmhm, likewise.\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san, I'm relying on you to get me aradama data.\r\nKofuki: Yeah, count on it.\r\nSuu: (Ah... Thinking about this the other way around, with all these strong people here, doesn't that make this a really safe mission?)\r\nSuu: Shichinosato-san's started looking all excited too.\r\nKiyoka: That's usually how she is before we go on a mission.\r\nKofuki: You better be letting me play with some aradama-chan tough enough to be worth it, okay?\r\nMaki: No need to worry about that. We're expecting a lot from the group with you, Itomi, and Juujou.\r\nMaki: The site you're going to has a high number of outbreaks.\r\nSayaka: Understood.\r\nSuu: Ahhhhh... Why do you want to go to the most dangerous places?\r\nSuu: (I just don't get it... Are Shichinosato-san and Itomi-san actually space aliens or something...?)\r\nHokuto: Don't make that face. If it comes down to it, I'll be there to save you.\r\nSuu: Hokuto-san... I won't leave your side!!\r\nHokuto: Then we wouldn't be able to fight, would we...?\r\nSuu: ...Are you feeling that motivated for this?\r\nHokuto: I am. It's rare to join a mission alongside a select group of top fighters. There's nothing to dislike about it.\r\nKiyoka: I am feeling a little nervous, but let's try our best to keep up, Asahina-san, Inami-san.\r\nHokuto: Of course. It looks like we're about to start. Let's go.\r\nSuu: Ahhh~...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: That's Why I Said I Didn't Want to Do This...\r\n\r\nHokuto: YAAH!\r\nHokuto: Leave the smaller sized aradama to us. Could you handle that big aradama!\r\nTsugumi: Don't worry about any coming up behind you, Itomi-san, Juujou-san.\r\nHiyori: Got it. Let's go, Sayaka.\r\nSayaka: Mm... We'll finish this quickly.\r\n\r\nKofuki: What's wrong, what's wrong!\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOO...!!\r\nKofuki: Oh! Looks like you wanna keep going; so I'll play with you!\r\nKiyoka: It feels like more and more aradama keep coming here...\r\nKiyoka: Kofuki-san, if it's possible, let's try sticking close together to fight!\r\nKiyoka: Ah, she ran off. Please come baaaack!\r\nKofuki: Just gimme a minute.\r\nAradama: ...GUGGGI!\r\nSuu: ...Waaahh!? They came this way!?\r\nSuu: I feel like I'm in danger; I'm running away!\r\nKiyoka: Not you too, Inami-san!? There's still aradama that way!\r\n\r\nAradama: ......\r\nKofuki: This's it for you--\r\nSuu: Save me... pleaseeeeee...!\r\nKofuki: Huh!? Hey... You're getting in the way of the good part!\r\nSuu: Buttt...\r\nKofuki: Well, I'll give you credit for bringing me more aradama-chan at least!\r\nAradama: ...GGGII!\r\nSuu: Eeeeeek!?\r\nKiyoka: ...Inami-san!? Whatever you do, keep your utsushi up!\r\n\r\nElsewhere, Hokuto and the others were--\r\n\r\nHiyori: Things are taken care of over here.\r\nHiyori: It was a real help having you handle the aradama following the big one around, Asahina-san, Ban-san.\r\nSayaka: Mm... We could focus on it thanks to you and Tsugumi.\r\nTsugumi: No need to thank us. It's our mission.\r\nHokuto: I only did what I was capable of.\r\nHokuto: (Itomi Sayaka, Juujou Hiyori... They really are strong.)\r\nHokuto: (It's not that I think I'll get the chance to become that strong just by completing missions with them, but, a toji's strength... There might be no limit to it.)\r\nHokuto: (Though... Why are there this many talented individuals in one group to begin with?)\r\nScreaming Voice: EEEEEEKK!?\r\nScreaming Voice: SOMEBODY HELP MEEEEEEEEEE...!\r\nHiyori: Just now; that's...!\r\nHokuto: ...It's Suu. Let's hurry.\r\n\r\nSuu: Musumi-san... Shichinosato-san! I'm begging you... I'm begging you, so... Hurry!\r\nKofuki: There's still way more aradama-chan to go through, so sit put!\r\nKiyoka: Inami-san, you reapplied utsushi just now, didn't you? That makes the third time... There aren't a lot of toji who can reuse utsushi that much.\r\nSayaka: We came to save you, but, you seem okay...?\r\nSuu: I'm not okay at all... At all!\r\nSayaka: I saw you reapply utsushi just now. You can still fight.\r\nSuu: I've been in a huge pinch this whole time!\r\nHokuto: She can still fight. Suu can use utsushi even more than this.\r\nSuu: Why are you telling them that!?\r\nSayaka: That's amazing...\r\nKofuki: In that case, you can keep on being aradama bait for me!\r\nSuu: Ehhhhh!?\r\nAradama: ......\r\nTsugumi: Certain data does indicate that aradama also tend to attack weaker seeming targets. Though it's still in need of verification.\r\nSuu: Don't just decide that on your own...!! I'm not an aradama charmer, okay!?\r\nSayaka: You don't need to worry. We'll protect you, Suu.\r\nSuu: Th-Thank you very much!\r\nSuu: But still, I want you to save me right now! Get me out of this situation...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: If Possible... I'd Like a Break From Missions for a While \r\n\r\nSuu: Eep!?\r\nTsugumi: Are you doing alright-?\r\nSuu: I just got a little spooked by the sound of okatana hitting an aradama...\r\nSuu: Even though I realize everyone's getting rid of the aradama.\r\nTsugumi: I see. Though, Inami-san, it seems like you can use utsushi a great number of times, so if you were able to overcome your fears facing aradama, it would be very unlikely you would get hurt.\r\nSuu: Thinking about it is one thing, but actually doing it is a whole different story.\r\nTsugumi: I understand. Raw data gathered from aradama will be biased, so it's vital to see the aradama moving about up close like this as well.\r\nTsugumi: Today is looking to be an auspicious day, with all the aradama I've gotten to see and the data to collect.\r\nSuu: Ah.\r\nSuu: (This person too... She's dangerous after all!)\r\nSuu: (I don't know how many times I've thought this now, but... Let this be over already-!)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: I'm leading this aradama over towards you!\r\nKofuki: Sure! Don't worry about beating 'em, just keep sending more and more aradama-chan my way!\r\nKiyoka: We're only doing it like this for today, okay?\r\nKofuki: I'm more than happy to do this anytime though.\r\nHokuto: Shichinosato-san! Would it be alright for me to send one more aradama at you then?\r\nKofuki: I'll take any of them you've got!\r\nKofuki: Step right up, fresh aradama-chan!\r\nHokuto: (We weren't at all able to reach the coordination we were working towards during practice, in the end.)\r\nHokuto: (With Shichinosato-san, we could hardly even take a formation.)\r\nKiyoka: Honestly... You're only paying attention to the aradama that come right in front of you.\r\nHokuto: (But outside of practice, Shichinosato-san is like a different person.)\r\nHokuto: (And Musumi-san, understanding her nature, smoothly supports her while fighting the aradama.)\r\nHokuto: I can't let myself lose here either... can I.\r\n\r\nSanae: Great work, everyone-. Today was a little rough on us, huh.\r\nHiyori: Were you in charge of leading a different group, Iwakura-san?\r\nSanae: Mmhm. I was working together with the people from my group to stop the aradama from leaving the predicted area, and also helping escort anyone who couldn't evacuate on time.\r\nSayaka: I wouldn't really be able to do that.\r\nSanae: Everyone has their own role. I wouldn't be able to fight like you can either, Itomi-san.\r\nHiyori: Sayaka. Since there were so many aradama, you must have taken out a lot of them, right?\r\nSayaka: I stopped remembering how many halfway.\r\nHokuto: If we're comparing numbers, you would have gotten the most, wouldn't you?\r\nKofuki: Probably-. I got to play with so many aradama-chan I couldn't even keep up counting, so I'm satisfied.\r\nKofuki: I've got her to thank for that too.\r\nHokuto: Suu wouldn't feel so fortunate though... You really do love to fight aradama, don't you.\r\nHokuto: I can't overlook that you ignored both orders and the unit's formation, but adaptability is a necessity, and I admire your dedication to the mission.\r\nHokuto: I suppose it's fine so long as you don't cause any trouble for the girls you're assigned to work with.\r\nKofuki: Heh, Kiyoka can handle it so it's all good.\r\n\r\nSuu: I don't know how many times I thought I was going to die today... I mean it, I'm on my last legs.\r\nHokuto: Though, since you weren't hurt in the end, it turned out fine.\r\nSuu: No way; this time was bad enough that I want a special vacation or something. My heart took more than enough damage!\r\nMaki: What's this? I'd heard Inami was about to drop from exhaustion, but you look lively enough to me.\r\nSuu: Shidou-san!? D-Did you need something from us?\r\nMaki: Nothing in particular. Just checking in on the toji who took part in the mission.\r\nHokuto: You elite guard must have had your hands full too. Though, there's something on my mind. Mind if I ask you?\r\nMaki: Go right ahead.\r\nHokuto: Whichever way you look at it, don't you think the group Suu and I were put in had an excessive amount of fighting strength?\r\nMaki: Ahh, that's what you mean. The plan was always to make one team of more average ability and one with more capable fighters.\r\nMaki: Just in order to counter any powerful aradama that appeared. On top of that, there were a lot of unique individuals, so it was Suzuka's thinking that having them all in one place would make them easier to manage.\r\nHokuto: ...Because of that, we had a lot of trouble.\r\nSuu: And I... I ended up being some kind of aradama bait... It was the worst.\r\nMaki: ...That must have been difficult. Though, while the average level of students chosen for this training was high, not many could keep up with that group you were in.\r\nMaki: Knowing you two, I suggested you. And, it doesn't look like I was wrong.\r\nSuu: Sigh... Just because I can use utsushi a little more than usual, I wish you wouldn't forget how weak I am...\r\nSayaka: I... I want to see how many times you can apply utsushi.\r\nSuu: I-Itomi-sama!? How long have you been here for!?\r\nSayaka: Not long. I saw you from the front entrance.\r\nSayaka: But, why are you using \"sama\"? I'm... not that important.\r\nSuu: Itomi-sama... You're way too strong, aren't you... So that's why!\r\nSayaka: There are toji stronger than me. ...You can call me Sayaka.\r\nSuu: No no no... There's no way I could say your name that bluntly! At least let me use Sayaka-san!!\r\nSayaka: Alright. And... How many more times can you apply utsushi, Suu? I want to see.\r\nSuu: How many more times...? I'm all out of stock for today, so I can't show you any more utsushis!\r\nSayaka: That's a shame...\r\nSayaka: But, we go to the same school. I'll look forward to when we go on missions together.\r\nSuu: It's not like it's any fun to see either...\r\nHokuto: ......\r\nSuu: Hokuto-san, why do you look like you're enjoying this. You're a bully.\r\nHokuto: That's not what I was smiling about. I was just thinking, it might have been difficult, but this was a good experience for you.\r\nHokuto: If nothing comes up, I won't be leaving for another two days, so do you want to go out somewhere and enjoy ourselves tomorrow?\r\nSuu: Absolutely! I'll start coming up with a list of places to go right now!\r\nHokuto: You really do change moods at the drop of a hat, don't you."}, {"paste_key": "DduexLTg", "title": "Human Egg", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/DduexLTg", "timestamp": "", "hits": "60", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/xkR1G_BHzCI\r\n[Like last year's Escape from Wonderland event, there was an official competition to guess the identities of all players before the final story update.]\r\n\r\n1: Human Egg\r\n\r\nMirja: ...Hidden among us are two impostors. Asakura Mihono, Musumi Kiyoka. Which faction do you belong to?\r\nMihono: I'm an \"Egg\"! You have to believe me, Mirja-san!\r\nKiyoka: I'm not a \"Human\" either... But, what about you, Mirja-san...?\r\nKanami: Take it easy, you three. It's not going to help if we doubt each other before we can even prove anything.\r\nMai: Mmhm. We've only just started the first sunrise, after all...\r\nHiyori: No, there's nothing wrong with a little investigating, is there? Though, I doubt any Human is going to give themselves up so easy.\r\nSayaka: ............\r\nEllen: Oh? Saaya, what's the matter? If you keep being so quiet, everyone's going to start suspecting you.\r\nSayaka: ...But, I don't know what I should say. This is my first time playing this game...\r\nEllen: Oh! That's right! Then, let's pause the game for a minute--\r\n\r\nEllen: Ahem. Now then, to help out Saaya, I'll go over the rules for \"Human Egg\" once more.\r\nEllen: This is a kind of deduction game, where the players are divided into the Egg faction and the Human faction. The story is that Humans have transformed with magic to sneak into the village where the Eggs live peacefully.\r\nEllen: Eggs are a Human's favorite food. At night, when the Eggs are sound asleep, the Humans reveal their true forms, and go around eating one Egg each night.\r\nEllen: If this goes on, the Egg village will be wiped out. That's why, during the day, the Eggs will hold a discussion and vote on a suspicious Egg to be crack open at a time.\r\nEllen: However, even if you crack an Egg that's actually a Human in disguise, it doesn't mean the transformation magic will wear off. That's what makes this game so fun and hard.\r\nSayaka: Mm. It does sound hard...\r\nMai: Though, it's not as if we won't get hints, Sayaka-chan.\r\nKanami: Yeah. After all, the Egg faction has three kinds of allies with handy special powers on their side.\r\nSayaka: Allies...?\r\nMihono: The first one is \"Humpty Dumpty\". During the night, they have the ability to check one Egg to see if they're real or not.\r\nMihono: They can only check once every other day, but I'd say it's the most important role to play.\r\nSayaka: Humpty Dumpty can check Eggs... Okay. I understand.\r\nKiyoka: The second is the \"Easter Egg\", with the power to resurrect. It only works if that person retires after being eaten by a Human, but after that, when the next Human is out, it revives you.\r\nKiyoka: It only revives you after the morning of the next day, but, if the Easter Egg does resurrect someone, we know that someone who retired the previous day must be an impostor.\r\nHiyori: And then, with the Egg faction, there's an ally called a \"Rabbit\" that uses transformation magic like the Humans.\r\nSayaka: Rabbit...?\r\nHiyori: Yeah. The Rabbit is friendly to the Eggs, and when it becomes night, they secretly reveals themselves, using their power to protect one Egg from the Humans.\r\nHiyori: But, they can't protect themselves. If their identity comes out, the Humans should go straight after them.\r\nHiyori: Also, if Humpty Dumpty inspects them, the result will be \"Not an Egg\", so you have to be careful not to crack the Rabbit by accident.\r\nSayaka: The Easter Egg can resurrect you... The Rabbit isn't an Egg, but they protect Eggs... Nn, I get most of it.\r\nEllen: Okay. Then, that's all for the rules to Human Egg.\r\nEllen: The dedicated app we downloaded to your phone will cover the rest, so you just need to repeat what happens during the night and day parts.\r\nEllen: This time, between the eight of us, there are two Humans disguised as Eggs. Once the humans eliminate all the Eggs, or the Eggs eliminate all the Humans, the last faction standing is the winner.\r\nMai: Ah, if there's something you don't understand while we're playing the game, you can ask us anything, alright?\r\nSayaka: Okay. I'll ask when that happens.\r\nEllen: Of course. So then, let's get the game started again.\r\n\r\nEllen: ...By the way, who is Humpty Dumpty? Since you should finish your judging by the first night, most play with them coming out and saying their results.\r\nSayaka: They do? Then, I'll come out. I'm Humpty Dumpty.\r\nSayaka: I didn't really know what to do, but I checked Hiyori next to me. It said she was an Egg.\r\nHiyori: Alright, good. That means you know Sayaka and I are innocent.\r\nKanami: Nah, we don't know that for sure yet, Hiyori-chan. Somebody might come out and oppose her.\r\nSayaka: Oppose...? Mai, what does that mean?\r\nMai: After someone announces their role, if someone else comes out and says \"I'm the real one,\" then that's called opposing.\r\nMihono: Still, it looks like... nobody's going to oppose it. Which means we know Itomi-san's the real one.\r\nKanami: Huh? Nobody's going to do it? Mmm, It'd be more exciting if somebody opposed her though-.\r\nHiyori: Hm...\r\nMai: Ah...\r\nMirja: ......\r\nEllen: So that's how you feel, Kanamin... I see how it is.\r\nKanami: Eh? What's everyone looking at me like that for? I didn't say anything that weird, did I?\r\nHiyori: Well, who knows...\r\nMirja: Now then, why don't we move on to the first day's voting.\r\nSchool Announcement: Aradama have been confirmed to have appeared in the vicinity of the campus. Toji are to prepare to sortie at once. I repeat. Aradama have been confirmed--\r\nEllen: Wow! We got called to action at a time like this!\r\nKiyoka: We'll have to pause this here, won't we...\r\nMihono: Let's go, guys! The faster we get rid of the aradama, the faster we can start the game again!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Reliable Ally\r\n\r\nMihono: We safely took care of the aradama, so let's get right back to the game!\r\n\r\nKanami: Hmmm, who should I vote for-? It's hard to pick, since it's the very first one... Did you decide already, Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: Sure. I decided a while ago.\r\nKanami: Ehh!? On who!?\r\nHiyori: ...You'll know soon.\r\nEllen: Is everyone ready to go? Then, vote in the app for the person you think is a Human, and push the button.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan, did you figure out how to vote?\r\nSayaka: I'm okay. I pushed the button now.\r\nApp Announcer: Voting has been recorded. I will now announce the results of the voting.\r\nKanami: Ah, here it comes! Alright, who's going to be the first egg to crack~?\r\nKanami: ...Wait, huhhh!?\r\nVoting Results: Hiyori, Mirja, Ellen, Mai, Mihono, Sayaka --> Kanami. Kanami --> Ellen.\r\nApp Announcer: As a result of the voting, it has been decided that Kanami-san will be cracked today.\r\nKanami: J-J-Just like that~!? But, but, why me~!?\r\nHiyori: If someone had opposed Humpty Dumpty, then Sayaka and I would have our innocence disproven. But you were the one saying you wished someone would oppose us. So of course this happened.\r\nEllen: I felt the same. It looked like Kanamin was a Human signalling to her ally to come out and oppose them.\r\nMirja: In the first place, I cannot imagine Itomi Sayaka, who had only just learned the rules, would pretend to be Humpty Dumpty right away.\r\nMai: Sorry, Kanami-chan. Saying what you said didn't really seem like it would help the Egg faction at all.\r\nApp Announcer: Now, Kanami-san, please retire.\r\nKanami: Uwehh~! You're kidding me~! I just wanted to have more fun playingggg~!\r\nMihono: Kanami, rest in peace... So, next is the night part, right?\r\nKiyoka: U-Um... Before that, should we talk about who the Rabbit should protect first?\r\nKiyoka: I think we should pick between Itomi-san and Juujou-san, since they were already proven innocent...\r\nEllen: I think it'd be best to protect Saaya.\r\nMai: I'll agree with that.\r\nMirja: Yes. If Humpty Dumpty is able to remain until the third day, they can then carry out a second inspection. The game would progress in the Egg faction's favor.\r\nKiyoka: That's right... isn't it. Then, I'll agree with that suggestion.\r\nEllen: With that settled, let's start the night part. The app will advance on its own from here, so everyone, close your eyes.\r\nApp Announcer: ...Night falls across the Egg village.\r\nApp Announcer: The Humans may open their eyes and discuss in the chat menu which Egg they will decide to eat.\r\n???: .............\r\nApp Announcer: Now, the Rabbit may open their eyes and decide which Egg they will protect.\r\nSayaka: (Ah... Kanami might have been the Rabbit, but we didn't think of that...)\r\nSayaka: (If she was, then no one will be protected... If they choose Humpty Dumpty, no one will save me.)\r\nSayaka: (I'm a little nervous... I want this bad feeling to be wrong...)\r\nApp Announcer: All selections have been finished. Morning comes to the Egg village.\r\nSayaka: .........\r\nApp Announcer: It is now morning. Everyone, please open your eyes. Last night, no Eggs were eaten.\r\nMihono: Eh? Then, that means...\r\nKiyoka: It looks like the Rabbit's protection worked, Hono-chan!\r\nHiyori: This is getting interesting now. It's safe to say things are going well for the Egg faction.\r\nMirja: Yes. And also, we were able to confirm the Rabbit's existence. If things go well, then we should be able to hear the results of Humpty Dumpty's inspection again on the third day.\r\nSayaka: (Phew...)\r\nMai: Isn't that great, Sayaka-chan? You made it safely to morning.\r\nSayaka: ...Mm.\r\nEllen: Alright then, let's start the discussions for the second day! Let's scope out the Humans hiding in the Egg village!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Doubt\r\n\r\nMirja: The next most suspicious person would be... That's right. If I had to name one, it would be Musumi Kiyoka, wouldn't it.\r\nKiyoka: Eh...? Me...?\r\nMirja: Yes. There was something concerning about what you said yesterday.\r\nSayaka: Something concerning...?\r\nMirja: Yes. Last night, it should have been plainly evident that Itomi Sayaka, as Humpty Dumpty, was more valuable than Juujou Hiyori, whose role has not been identified.\r\nMirja: In spite of that, Musumi Kiyoka expressly asked which of them the Rabbit should protect. If she were an Egg, that would be a slightly unnatural thing to say.\r\nKiyoka: Ah, no, that was... I was just a little curious what everyone wanted to do, so I asked...\r\nMihono: Ahh~! That's super suspicious! I think maybe I'll vote for Kiyoka next time~. Hey, you guys think so too, right?\r\nHiyori: I don't really have a problem with that, but... Ellen. What do you think about what Mihono just said?\r\nEllen: Hmm. I don't mind doing some \"Kiyoka cracking\", but I can't say Mihomiho's leaving a great impression either.\r\nMai: Right... What Mihono-chan said now sounded like she might have been acting as a Human to lead us into \"cracking Kiyoka\"...\r\nMihono: Y-You've got it all wrong, Mai! Mirja-san's the one who was suspicious of Kiyoka, and I was just tagging along!\r\nEllen: I hate to break it to you, Mihomiho, but thinking like you should \"tag along\" with other people's opinions is a very very Human move to do.\r\nSayaka: Then, for this vote, we should vote for Mihono...?\r\nMihono: Uweeeh~! I'm telling you, just hold on~! We know Kiyoka was acting suspicious, so let's think this over some more~!\r\nMai: You do have a point, but... Ah, everyone, how about if we do this then?\r\nMai: Since the Rabbit is here, they should be able to protect Sayaka-chan again tonight--\r\nMai: In which case, if Mihono-chan makes it to the third day, we can have Sayaka-chan inspect her, and then we'll know for sure if she's innocent, won't we?\r\nHiyori: Makes sense. And, on the other hand, if we crack Mihono here, it might be even harder to figure out the truth.\r\nMirja: Then, the one we should vote for this time would be... Musumi Kiyoka. Do you have anything you would like to say for yourself now?\r\nKiyoka: Ah, yes... Whoever the Rabbit is, please make sure to protect Itomi-san tonight. That's all I have to say...\r\n\r\nKanami: Oh, finally, I'll have a friend over here!\r\nMirja: Etou Kanami. While the game is in session, those who have retired are forbidden from speaking.\r\nKanami: Ah, right... I'm sorry.\r\n\r\nEllen: Fufu. I think we heard a voice we shouldn't have been able to hear anymore, but let's move onto the voting now.\r\nEllen: And also, once it becomes the night part, will the Rabbit please protect Saaya, and will Saaya please inspect Mihomiho.\r\nSayaka: Nn, I got it.\r\n\r\nApp Announcer: ...It is now morning. Everyone, please open your eyes.\r\nApp Announcer: The one who was eaten last night was: Juujou-san. Juujou-san, please retire.\r\nHiyori: ...Sure, I understand.\r\nMai: So Hiyori-chan got eaten... Then, that means there's only five of us left.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan, what did the results of the inspection say?\r\nSayaka: I inspected Mihono, like you told me. It said Mihono was \"Not an Egg\".\r\nEllen: Is that so. Then, today we're going \"Mihono cracking\", it looks like.\r\nMihono: Actually, I don't think that's such a good idea. Since, last night, I was the one who protected Itomi-san.\r\nSayaka: Eh...? Mihono, you were the Rabbit...?\r\nMirja: No, no matter how you look at it, I can't imagine that's anything more than a lie in desperation. That's something that she should have come about about yesterday.\r\nMirja: Now, let's start with the voting. If either of Etou Kanami or Musumi Kiyoka were Humans, then this should mean our victory.\r\n\r\nApp Announcer: As a result of the voting, it has been decided that Mihono-san will be cracked today. Mihono-san, please retire.\r\nMihono: Wahhn~! You're all so mean~! I told you I'm the Rabbit, didn't I~!\r\n\r\nSayaka: Ellen, what happens now?\r\nEllen: If Mihomiho was the second Human, the app should announce that the Egg faction wins now...\r\nEllen: ...Hmm, it's not saying anything. Then it looks like the game is still going.\r\nMirja: I see then... Which would mean, we need to re-examine our deductions so far.\r\nMai: Right... But, I think it's for sure that we broke one Human. If two Humans were still around at this stage, it would announce the Human faction had won instead.\r\nEllen: Yes... And, with this number of people, the game should end tomorrow. I don't know who will be targeted tonight, but let's try to win with who we have left.\r\nApp Announcer: With that, night falls across the Egg village. Everyone, please close your eyes.\r\nSayaka: ............\r\nSayaka: (Tonight, I'll probably be the one who gets eaten... I'm the only one left who was proven innocent...)\r\nSayaka: (This was my first game, but, I had fun.)\r\nApp Announcer: ...It is now morning. Everyone, please open your eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Which One is Human?\r\n\r\nApp Announcer: The one who was eaten last night was: Ellen-san. Ellen-san, please retire.\r\nSayaka: Eh... It wasn't me...?\r\nEllen: Oh... It's a real shame I won't be able to join in the last discussion. Good luck with the rest, everyone.\r\nMirja: ...With that, there are only three of us remaining.\r\nHiyori: No, I'm here too.\r\nSayaka: Eh...\r\nApp Announcer: The Easter Egg's ability, resurrection, has activated. Juujou-san, please return to the game.\r\nHiyori: I got the notification just a second ago. After the Easter Egg gets eaten by Humans and retires, once a Human retires, it can resurrect you and bring you back.\r\nHiyori: And this also means we know for sure that Mihono was a Human.\r\nMirja: Which means, there are four of us remaining... However, as we know Itomi Sayaka and Juujou Hiyori have been proven innocent, the only possible Humans are Yanase Mai and myself.\r\nHiyori: Right. But first, let's put everything we know in order.\r\nHiyori: Sayaka was Humpty Dumpty, and I was the Easter Egg. Then, Mihono was a Human, and Kanami, Kiyoka, and Ellen were from the Egg faction. Does that all sound right so far?\r\nMirja: Yes. Nothing about that is mistaken.\r\nHiyori: Okay. Then, what caught my attention next is, who was the Rabbit... For starters, it can't be Kanami. Since, after Kanami retired, the Rabbit's protection activated again.\r\nHiyori: Which means, it could only be Kiyoka, Ellen, Mai, or Mirja.\r\nSayaka: Mai, Mirja, are you not the Rabbit?\r\nMai: That's right. I'm an Egg, Hiyori-chan.\r\nMirja: And I... I'm not the Rabbit either.\r\nHiyori: So neither of you will come out and say you're the Rabbit then.\r\nHiyori: If one of you did claim to be the rabbit, we could ask who you'd protected so far, and we might be able to tell something from that... But it doesn't look like that's happening.\r\nHiyori: Sayaka, which of them do you think is more suspicious?\r\nSayaka: I can't tell... But, Mirja was the first one to suspect Kiyoka.\r\nMirja: No, that shouldn't be considered a reason. There was certainly something off about what Musumi Kiyoka had said the previous day. I recall everyone agreeing as much as well.\r\nSayaka: Then, Mai is the Human...? I remember, Mai covered for Mihono.\r\nMai: I didn't. I wasn't covering for her; I only wanted to make sure whether or not Mihono-chan was innocent. I'm an Egg. You have to believe me, Sayaka-chan.\r\nHiyori: This is tough. Both of their arguments sound convincing. In that case, we're just going to have to go with our gut feeling...\r\nHiyori: ...Sayaka, you should be the one to make the call here. Since I retired partway through, there should be things I didn't notice. So I'll go along with whatever you decide.\r\nSayaka: ...Okay, I understand.\r\nSayaka: Is that okay with you, Mai, Mirja?\r\nMirja: Yes, I don't mind. Whichever way, I have no option but to vote for Yanase Mai in the next voting period.\r\nMai: Mmhm. I can't vote for anyone besides Kitora-san either, so it's up to you who decides which of us gets cracked, Sayaka-chan.\r\nHiyori: Alright, it's decided then.\r\nSayaka: (This decision will mean whether we win or lose. It's a big responsibility. But, since I made it all the way to the last day... I want to do finish it.)\r\nSayaka: (Mai and Mirja both have parts that seemed suspicious. So it wouldn't be strange if either of them were a Human.)\r\nSayaka: (But, if I think carefully back from the first day, there should be some clues...)\r\nSayaka: (...Ah, I know. That means, the Human might be...)\r\nHiyori: Sayaka, did you make up your mind?\r\nSayaka: ...Mm.\r\nMirja/Mai: ...........\r\nHiyori: Alright. Then, tell me who I should vote for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Smile When the Game is Over\r\n\r\nSayaka: I'm going... to vote for Mai.\r\nMirja/Mai: ...!\r\nHiyori: I see... Okay then. Let's get right to voting.\r\nSayaka: Mai, if I got it wrong... I'm sorry.\r\nMai: No, you don't have to worry about that, Sayaka-chan. That's just the kind of game this is.\r\n\r\nApp Announcer: The voting has finished. I will now announce the results of the voting.\r\nVoting Targets: Sayaka, Hiyori, Mirja --> Mai. Mai --> Mirja.\r\nApp Announcer: As a result of the voting, it has been decided that Mai-san will be cracked today.\r\nHiyori: Well, what now? It should tell us which faction won.\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nApp Announcer: Mai-san's egg has been cracked. The Human faction has been completely eliminated. The Egg faction are the winners.\r\nSayaka: ...!\r\nMai: Fufu. Aww, we lost.\r\nMirja: Well done, Itomi Sayaka.\r\nHiyori: Yeah. Looks like I was right leaving it up to you.\r\n\r\nEllen: Yes! Good job, Saaya! I'm so happy the Egg faction managed to win!\r\nKiyoka: Thank you, Itomi-san! I had faith the Egg faction would make it!\r\nSayaka: Ellen, Kiyoka... That's good. I'm glad everyone is happy with this.\r\nMihono: You did great too, Mai. Nnn, I thought you would've have been able to pull it off though-.\r\nMai: I thought I kept it hidden pretty well myself. Sayaka-chan, how did you tell I was a Human?\r\nSayaka: Because... On the first day, you didn't help out Kanami.\r\nSayaka: Since Kanami enjoys things with all her energy, it didn't seem strange that she would say something like that.\r\nSayaka: And, Mai should know that better than anyone, but you didn't say anything. That's why, it seemed wrong to me.\r\nMai: So that's why... Mm. When you put it like that, you're definitely right. When Kanami-chan said that, all I was thinking about was that we could crack her.\r\nSayaka: Also, when you covered for Mihono.\r\nMai: Eh? But, I explained the reason for that, didn't I?\r\nSayaka: Mm. But, even though you covered for Mihono, you didn't cover for Kiyoka.\r\nSayaka: But you would normally be worried about Kiyoka too, Mai. They were both suspicious, but you could have also cracked them the other way around.\r\nSayaka: The time with Kanami, and the time with Kiyoka. Both times, you didn't look like you were acting like yourself to me. That's why I thought you were a Human.\r\nEllen: Excellent! That's something only Saaya could tell, because of how much she adores Maimai!\r\nMai: Mmhm. Sayaka-chan completely got the better of me.\r\nMirja: ...By the way, which of you was the Rabbit? Was it Musumi Kiyoka, or Kohagura Ellen?\r\nKiyoka: Right. That was me, Mirja-san.\r\nMihono: Ehh!? It was you, Kiyoka!? I thought for sure it was either Ellen-san, since she's used to the game, or Mirja-san, since she's so good with strategies...\r\nMihono: Wait? But, on the second day, didn't you ask for the Rabbit to \"please protect Itomi-san tonight\"?\r\nKiyoka: Fufu, that was my strategy to make it seem like the Rabbit would still be alive, Hono-chan.\r\nMirja: Then, that would mean, the question I remembered doubting was also...?\r\nKiyoka: Ah, yes. That was part of my strategy too. I thought that, if I said that, the Human faction would avoid Itomi-san and go after Juujou-san instead, since she was the other innocent person.\r\nHiyori: I see. So then, on the first night, I was the one who got targeted. And Kiyoka pulled a great move protecting me.\r\nKiyoka: But then, because of that move, it also caused me to be suspected the following day... And, for that same reason, I couldn't come out as the Rabbit...\r\nMihono: Uuu, either way, Kiyoka really pulled one over on us-. If we had been able to eat an Egg for the second day, I would have stayed quiet, and then I wouldn't have stood out so much-.\r\nMai: We played right into Musumi-san's hand, didn't we, Mihono-chan.\r\nMirja: With that, it's assured that the MVP of this game was Itomi Sayaka, who secured the victory. Musumi Kiyoka would be the shadow MVP.\r\nHiyori: Definitely. You two really did great this time.\r\nKiyoka: Ehehe. You're making me blush, complimenting me so much.\r\nSayaka: But, everyone helped us to win. That's what I think.\r\nSayaka: And also, it was a lot of fun.\r\nMihono: Yeah. I think we feel the same.\r\nMai: That's right. Even if we lost, it was fun playing on the Human faction.\r\nKanami: U-Uuuu...\r\nHiyori: What, Kanami? What are you crying about? Actually, how long have you been sitting there for?\r\nKanami: Uwahhh-! That's no fair-! I wanted to keep on having fun playing the game too-!\r\nEllen: Oh! Kanamin's frustration from retiring first is bursting out!\r\nSayaka: ...Then, do you want to play again?\r\nKanami: Eh? Can we? Great! This time for sure, I'll do a lot more!\r\nHiyori: You're absolutely hopeless."}, {"paste_key": "ZBZV7Dsp", "title": "Entwining Bonds: Fierce Genius x Strange Genius", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/ZBZV7Dsp", "timestamp": "", "hits": "62", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/xxSvgtSquMk\r\n\r\n1: An Awkward Trip for Two?\r\n\r\nYume: There's a hot spring at the inn we're staying at tonight, right? I can't wait~! When it gets to be night, let's play cards! And also, I brought othello too.\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, we aren't going here to enjoy ourselves. Why not focus on completing our mission here first?\r\nMaki: Yomi's right. Today we're on a joint assignment with other toji. As the elite guard, we need to always keep in mind that we set an example for the others...\r\nSuzuka: Though, with this many of us here, we should be able to settle this quickly.\r\nYume: Yeah, and since I'm here, it'll be over right away. And besides, the other girls look like they're having fun too.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan, that bento was delicious, wasn't it? Would you like to have something sweet for dessert too? I baked cookies, just for today.\r\nSayaka: Wow, there's so many.\r\nMai: Since I heard there would be lots of us on this overnight trip, I rolled up my sleeves making them, but maybe it was too much.\r\nSayaka: No, I'm glad there's so many.\r\nMai: Ufufu, thank you. Would everyone from the elite guard like some too?\r\nYume: Can I? Thanks. If she's offering, we should just have snacktime with them! I'll work extra hard after we get there, so we can do it, can't we?\r\nMaki: I don't see why not; we should be building up our stamina right now...\r\nMaki: This is Shidou Maki. Did something come up?\r\nMaki: What!? Understood. We'll deal with it at once.\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san? What's the matter?\r\nMaki: It sounds like there's been a large outbreak of aradama in the mountain forests here. Every moment counts, so we should get off the train here and deal with that first.\r\nYomi: But, if everyone gets off here, won't we be too late to complete our primary duty with this expedition?\r\nMaki: Right, and HQ has a proposal for that. From here, we'll organize into two groups and carry out our missions separately.\r\nMaki: Yume, along with Itomi Sayaka, the two of you will stay on this train to our original objective and start on the mission.\r\nMaki: The rest of us will get off the train now and hurry to the scene.\r\nSuzuka: Yume and Itomi-san? Those two are being sent alone to the mission point?\r\nMai: Shidou-san, would it be alright for me to to be with Sayaka-chan? Sending the two of them alone is just a little...\r\nMaki: I'm little unsure about it myself, but HQ named them directly, so they must have something in mind. Yume, Itomi Sayaka, what do you think?\r\nYume: Cause I'm so strong, it'll be easy peasy even if I do it by myself~. You can go with them, Sayaka-chan.\r\nSayaka: I can be fine if I do it by myself too. I'll defeat the aradama quickly, then meet up with you.\r\nYume: Nngh~, well I can beat them in a second, and then I'll meet up with you onee-sans faster than Sayaka-chan can!\r\nSuzuka: Sigh... Unfortunately, it doesn't seem they have any intention of working together to defeat them.\r\nMaki: It's not helping my concerns, but, with each of their skills, they should be able to manage.\r\nYomi: We appear to have reached our stop. Everyone, let's go. Tsubakuro-san, I wish you luck.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan, will you really be alright without me?\r\nSayaka: Mm. I can do my best if I have your cookies.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan! In that case, take them all with you! Here! And here! And this batch too!\r\nSayaka: ...It's heavy. But, thank you for all of them. I'll work hard.\r\nMai: Of course! Do your best, Sayaka-chan.\r\nSuzuka: You too, Yume. Try to get along with Itomi-san.\r\nYume: They're gone now.\r\nSayaka: Mm...\r\nYume/Sayaka: ....................................\r\nYume: WAHH-! If we just stay quiet this whole time, I'll get so bored I'll die!\r\nYume: I know! I came up with something good. Sayaka-chan, since it's just us two, wanna have a competition?\r\nYume: A competition?\r\nYume: Yeah. A competition to see who can beat the most aradama! I'm pretty sure I'll win, but it'll still be fun, won't it?\r\nSayaka: ...Okay, but, I probably won't lose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Yume and Sayaka's Showdown Begins!\r\n\r\nAradama: GUOOOOO...\r\nYume: Kyahaha, a whole bunch came out! Anyway, Sayaka-chan, our competition's starting! EIIIII--!\r\nSayaka: I won't... lose either...\r\nYume: Not bad, Sayaka-chan! I think I should start getting serious soon too! YAAAAAHH!\r\n\r\nAradama: Keeeee...\r\nYume: Huh? Is it over already?\r\nSayaka: It looks like it...\r\nYume: Ahaha, they were so weak-! Hey, hey, how many did you beat, Sayaka-chan?\r\nSayaka: I think I got about fifty...\r\nYume: No way-! That's how many I got! Boo~, so it's a draw then, huhh. But, for sure next time, I'm not gonna lose!\r\nSayaka: Mm... I won't lose either.\r\nYume: Hello, Maki-onee-san? It was easy as pie over here, you know? ...Yeah, I got it. We'll go ahead.\r\nSayaka: Shidou Maki? What did she want?\r\nYume: It's about our rooms at the ryokan. The elite guard got a Japanese style room, and everyone else got a Western style room, so she said to go ahead and wait there for them.\r\n\r\nSayaka: Are Mai and the others not here yet? This room is... too big by myself...\r\n\r\nYume: Are those onee-sans still not hereee? I got the cards and othello board all set up, but this is boring-.\r\n\r\nSayaka: Mai, she's still not here. But, we promised... We'd go in the hot springs together...\r\nSayaka: Mai's calling. Hello?\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan, I'm sorry. We safely finished eliminating the aradama, but we didn't make it in time for the last bus, so we won't be able to make it back there tonight.\r\nSayaka: Eh...?\r\nMai: I'm sorry about this. I know you'll be lonely by yourself, but just rest up in preparation for tomorrow, okay?\r\nSayaka: I understand. Okay... Then, bye.\r\nSayaka: I'm alone until morning...\r\n\r\nYume: Hello, Maki-onee-san? Huh? Stop calling over and over? But, it's so boring being by myself.\r\nMaki: If you're bored, then why not play with Itomi Sayaka? Don't you think she's bored by herself too?\r\nYume: I can't do that, because we promised we'd settle things tomorrow morning. If we start getting along, then it won't be a competition!\r\nYume: Hey, if you're busy, Maki-onee-san, then what about Yomi-onee-san or Suzuka-onee-san? I don't care which one, so let me talk to them, okay-?\r\nYomi: She handed the phone to me. Tsubakuro-san, I remembered hearing a very interesting rumor about the inn we booked...\r\nYume: Eh-, like what, like what? Is it a funny story? I wanna know~! Tell me!\r\nYomi: As the rumor goes, a ghost is said to appear in the inn you're staying at. Have you seen it yet?\r\nYume: EHH---!? What do you mean? Nobody said anything like that to me! Where is it? Where's it supposed to come out!?\r\nYomi: Ah, I'm sorry, I'm being called for something, so you'll have to excuse me. Anyway, have a nice night, Tsubakuro-san...\r\nYume: EHHHHH-!? Hang on, Yomi-onee-san! ......She hung up.\r\nYume: W-Well, stuff like ghosts isn't scary or anything! Cause, I'm super strong and all. There's nothing I can't beat... ...Ah-- But, can you beat a ghost with an okatana?\t\t[Minor trivia, Yume's okatana, Nikkari Ao'e, actually got its name for a legend in which it killed a ghost]\r\nYume: I didn't notice it, but it's completely dark outside. ...I can't take this anymore! I don't wanna stay here all alone by myself until morning--!\r\nYume: Oh, I got it! Sayaka-chan might be scared all by herself. Since I'm so strong, I'll go and help Sayaka-chan out.\r\nYume: I'll bring my snacks, and my cards, and othello with me... Okay, here I go!\r\nYume: Wait, th-there it is---! The ghost----!\r\nSayaka: Tsubakuro Yume? What's wrong? Was there a ghost?\r\nYume: Ah-- Sayaka-chan. Th-That's not it! There's no way a ghost was here! Geez-, don't scare me like that, okay? And, what's with you? What do you have all those snacks for.\r\nSayaka: Can I sleep in this room?\r\nYume: Huh?\r\nSayaka: It's lonely, being in a big room by yourself... And, I thought... Maybe Tsubakuro Yume was feeling the same way... Do you want to eat Mai's cookies together?\r\nYume: W-Well I wasn't scared of ghosts or feeling lonely or anything, but if that's what you wanna do, then that's okay-!\r\nYume: (Thank goodness. If Sayaka-chan is here with me, I should be fine.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Result of Their Competition Is...\r\n\r\nYume: These cookies are actually really tasty! I feel like I could eat them forever.\r\nSayaka: That's good. I think Mai will be happy to hear it too.\r\nYume: Hey, hey, Sayaka-chan, after we're done eating, let's play othello! We kept getting ties in cards, but I won't lose for sure at othello!\r\nSayaka: Mm. I'll try it...\r\n\r\nSayaka: Ah, you took a corner again... You're tough, Tsubakuro Yume.\r\nYume: This much is nothing-. Maki-onee-san and them are always training me super hard.\r\nSayaka: So you do things like that too... I'm a little surprised.\r\nYume: Even though they're always treating me like a little kid, they never go easy on me when we're playing games-. Really, they can be so immature it's annoying.\r\nYume: What about you, Sayaka-chan? Don't the onee-sans always treat you like a little kid?\r\nSayaka: Ummm... I... It doesn't bother me at all, but the others, they say that Mai's... She's too overprotective of me...\r\nYume: Hmm. It sorta seems like we both have it hard, being the youngest, don't we.\r\nSayaka: Mm... Ah, if I put this here...\r\nYume: No way! You flipped that many!? You turned the game around in one go. Now I don't have anywhere to put any!\r\nSayaka: I win...\r\nYume: Mmgh... That's only cause I got a little distracted talking to you now! We're playing again! I'm not stopping until I win!\r\nSayaka: That's fine, but... I'm a little tired... I'll take a short rest...\r\nSayaka: [snooze]...\r\nYume: Ehh-, hey, Sayaka-chan! Wait... She's really asleep now.\r\nYume: Well, if you're gonna be like that, then I guess I'll have to let you borrow my futon!\r\nYume: Yawn~, looking at Sayaka-chan while she's sleeping is making me feel sleepy too... Nn...\r\n\r\nSayaka: Tsubakuro Yume, wake up. Your phone is ringing.\r\nYume: It's Maki-onee-san. What's she want? Hello-?\r\nMaki: Yume, take Itomi with you and head to the site of the mission. From the sound of things, the count of aradama there now dwarfs the amount yesterday.\r\nMaki: We're headed there too right now, but it's going to be a while before we arrive. Could you two find a way to hold out there on your own?\r\nYume: Yeah, me and Sayaka-chan'll be fine. We'll finish it up before you onee-sans even get there. Right-, Sayaka-chan?\r\nSayaka: Right... Let's go.\r\n\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOOOO!\r\nYume: Uwah-, it's true! There's way more of them today-!\r\nSayaka: This looks... a little difficult today.\r\nYume: This'll be a piece of cake. Sayaka-chan, let's have another competition to see who can beat the most again today!\r\nSayaka: ......Hey, Tsubakuro Yume... Instead of a competition today, what if we work together?\r\nYume: Work together? But, we can't tell which one of us wins if we do that.\r\nSayaka: We still haven't done... the punishment game for othello last night. So... can I make your punishment that we have to fight together?\r\nYume: Nngh... If you say so, then... Fine, but just for today!\r\nSayaka: Okay. Then... Let's go.\r\nYume: I'm next! HAAAH!!\r\n\r\nSayaka: Pant... Pant... I can finally... see the end of them. Let's finish... the last of them together.\r\nYume/Sayaka: YAAA-----------!\r\nYume: We did it-! I thought it would be a little bit harder, but now that it's over, we beat them pretty easy, huh.\r\nSayaka: Mm. It's because you were helping me, Tsubakuro Yume.\r\nYume: ...Then, let's do a high five! Yaay-!\r\nMaki: What's going on here?\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan and Tsubakuro-san, high fiving...\r\nYume: Ah-- You're late, onee-sans-! We already took care of it with just the two of us.\r\nSuzuka: Eh!? The two of you took care of all those aradama?\r\nYume: When we put our skills together, it was as easy as that! See, Sayaka-chan, she's really strong!\r\nSayaka: No, you did a lot of the work, Tsubakuro Yume.

Even joking about it, these are all tough enemies we fought do or die style, see? Are we really... fine with this? Like, emotionally, this is what we're going with??\r\nMihono: Come on, Kaoru-san.

You'd better let me back in there from time to time!\r\nTsugumi: Of course, I'll consider it.\r\nKofuki: Sure; counting on you!\r\nKaoru: Ughh, I can't believe I got dragged along with this joke. Ahh-, I'm beat.\r\nEllen: You say that, but it looks you got a pretty high score, didn't you?\r\nKaoru: That's only cause Hiyori kept focusing me for some reason.\r\nKaoru: Is her programming bugged or something?\r\nTsugumi: That shouldn't be a bug... It may have been a response to you calling her eternally flat chested.\r\nKaoru: That effects her even in her programming... Hiyori... You're really something...\r\nKaoru: I know just the thing; mind if I mess with part of Hiyori's data? At least with her data, I can make her dreams come true!\r\nTsugumi: If that's what you want, Mashiko-san, I won't stop you... Ahh, you don't need to report which parts of the data you changed either.\r\nEllen: Tsugumin, Tsugumin! I want to try this training too!\r\nEllen: Can't I?\r\nTsugumi: Of course; it would mean fresh data for me, so it would be a big help.\r\nTsugumi: Though, the difficulty for this practice exercise was tuned for three people: Mashiko-san, Shichinosato-san, and Asakura-san...\r\nEllen: Got it!

I guess you're right.\r\nSuzuka: That's how you are, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: It's because we can't stop for anything until we atone for the past.\r\nSuzuka: You aren't entirely wrong to think that way, but... If you obsess over it, you'll only be making yourself suffer, alright?\r\nMaki: I know that, but, still.\r\nSuzuka: You're very serious, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: That's just how I am; I can't help it.\r\nMaki: By the way...

Do you remember before, when Itomi Sayaka appeared in that film?\r\nKofuki: Oh yeah, that happened, didn't it. It was that time with the historical drama thing, right?\r\nYui: If you mean that, I remember it too! Sayaka-chan was extra cute back then, wasn't she!\r\nMirja: It seems the director from then has made another offer.\r\nYui: So they've had their eyes on Mirja-san ever since then... They sure know their stuff.\r\nKofuki: What's she talking about now.\r\nMirja: No, that isn't entirely wrong... It seems that, somehow, they remember me from then, and made an offer.\r\nYui: See!\r\nKofuki: What're you looking all smug for!\r\nYui: Anyway, I'm 100% going to go see it, Mirja-san! I'll see it 7 million 7 hundred and 70 thousand times!\r\nYui: Actually, when are they filming it! I want to go watch!\r\nMirja: On Halloween day.\r\nYui: Halloween day!?\r\nYui: That's when I was supposed to go with Kanami-chan and them to their Halloween event...\r\nYui: Gununu... Do I go see Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan in their costumes, or do I go see Mirja-san...\r\nMirja: I should mention, along with myself, Itomi Sayaka and Iwakura Sanae will also be performing.\r\nYui: Sayaka-chan and Sanae-san too!? B-Both of them are hard to pass up...\r\nKofuki: You're making a pretty funny face now, y'know?\r\nYui: How can I choose though!\r\nMirja: No matter how much you puzzle over it, I won't bring you with me. This is work.\r\nYui: I understand...\r\nYui: I'll wait with bated breath to see the precious sight of Mirja-san when the movie opens, and prioritize the event where I'll only have one chance to see Kanami-chan and everyone!\r\nMirja: That isn't what I meant... Though, if you can accept that, then it's fine.\r\nKofuki: Well, if that's how it is, then you'd better get your body in shape for it.\r\nKofuki: Here, eat these niboshi. Want some milk with that too?\r\nMirja: ...Why niboshi and milk?\r\nKofuki: If they're asking for you, it's cause they want you to play a kaiju, right? You've gotta be at least two meters for it then.\r\nMirja: Of course I wouldn't receive an offer to play a kaiju. ...I will be playing a nun.\r\nKofuki: A nun? That'll be a laugh.\r\nYui: That's not true! She'd look just perfect as one!\r\nKofuki: Well, either way, give it your best shot. I'll be looking forward to it.\r\nMirja: ...Yes, I'll make every effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Halloween 19 - Mirja: End]: Sister Mirja!\r\n\r\nOn the day of filming.\r\n\r\nSanae: We finally have to perform... It's nervewracking. I-I think I should check over the script one more time...\r\nMirja: Will you be alright, Iwakura Sanae?\r\nSanae: Ah, Kitora-san... Since this is my first time doing something like this, I'm so nervous my hands won't stop shaking...\r\nMirja: Nervousness brought on by apprehension?\r\nMirja: Though, knowing you, you must have prepared extensively in advance, didn't you?\r\nSanae: I did; I made sure to practice, and I memorized how to say all my lines right!\r\nMirja: In that case, there should be nothing for you to worry about. You'll do just fine.\r\nSanae: Thank you, Kitora-san... But, if I don't double check, I'll be too nervous...\r\nSayaka: ...The script.\r\nSanae: Th-Thanks, Itomi-san!\r\nStaff: We're starting-. Iwakura-san, Kitora-san, please be ready to go-.\r\nSanae: Ah... L-Let's get going!\r\nMirja: Are you not going to check the script?\r\nSanae: No, I'll be okay even if I don't.\r\nMirja: (Her trembling has stopped.

From upstairs...?\r\nMirja: (...Suspcious of the sounds coming from the second floor, I go to investigate. When I climb the to top of the stairs, next comes...)\r\nMirja: KYAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nSanae: Ahahahaha! For you to be so shocked, my mischief was a big sucess nya!\r\nMirja: J-Just what are you!\r\nSanae: What am I? Just a plain old cat, nya.\r\nMirja: You demon cat... I-I'll destroy you here!\r\nSanae: You can go ahead and try, nya!\r\nMirja: (Iwakura Sanae comes rushing in... I fight back with the candlestick I'm holding.)\r\nSanae: Unyaa!?\r\nMirja: It's afraid of the flames...? Then!\r\nMirja: (Throwing the candlestick, while she's frightened by the flames, I take the knife I had hidden...!)\r\nSanae: UNYAAAAAAAAAA!! I'LL REMEMBER THIS, NYAAAAA!!\r\nMirja: ... It ran away? ...What is happening in this mansion...?\r\nStaff: Okaaay, that's good.\r\n\r\nMirja: Phew, nicely done, Iwakura Sanae. Thanks to your performance, we were able to make a fine action scene.\r\nSanae: Not at all! It's because of you, Mirja-san, that I think I was able to act so well!\r\nMirja: Then, why don't we say it's because of the both of us?\r\nSanae: Alright! Ahh... Now that that's over, I'm feeling kind of hungry.\r\nMirja: In that case, once Itomi Sayaka's scene is finished, how about we go to eat together?\r\nSanae: Sure thing! There's a delicious mizusawa udon place close by!\r\nMirja: Mizusawa udon is the udon of Gunma, isn't it? This isn't Gunma, though?\r\nSanae: I looked it up beforehand, thinking it could come in handy!\r\nMirja: I-I see...\r\nMirja: (What exactly was she expecting to need it for... Though, Iwakura Sanae seems to be happy about it... Well, there's no harm in it.)\r\nMirja: Then, I'll be looking forward to it.\r\nSanae: Sure! Please do!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/SIh8DzG3-h8\r\n[Aradama Hoodie - Kofuki: Start]: Pissing Me Off\r\n\r\nKofuki: GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: !? Just now, that was...\r\nTsugumi: Yes, that was the shrill scream of Shichinosato-san just now.\r\nMihono: Knowing Fukki, an aradama probably didn't get the drop on her or something, right?\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Yes, it's difficult to imagine. I think it's safe to say something else must have occurred.\r\nMihono: Something that would make Fukki scream like that...?\r\nTsugumi: That's right. ...That aside, \"gyaaaaaaa\" is just the sort of scream you'd expect from Shichinosato-san, isn't it.\r\nMihono: Ahaha, you're not wrong. Anyway, let's go see what happened!\r\n\r\nMihono: Fukki!\r\nKofuki: You two're slow. Though, thanks to that, I got to take my sweet time having fun with the aradma-chan.\r\nTsugumi: This is exactly as predicted so far. So then, what was that scream earlier about?\r\nKofuki: What, you heard that?\r\nMihono: When you scream that loud, of course we'd hear it.\r\nKofuki: Whoops, sorry. I couldn't help myself from shouting. Aghh, just thinking about it pisses me off.\r\nMihono: Pisses you off? The aradama?\r\nKofuki: You dumbass, Mihocchi! There's no way an aradama-chan'd piss me off!\r\nKofuki: What pissed me off was that tree there!\r\nTsugumi: ...You love aradama, and you hate vegetation. You're very irritable.\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san, I'm slightly concerned for your future.\r\nKofuki: I don't get what you're getting at, but I can tell you're making fun of me.\r\nTsugumi: You seem to be lacking calcium. Would you like a candy?\r\nKofuki: I've got milk to drink! And like I'd eat that shady looking candy anyway!\r\nMihono: Ahaha! You two sure get along-. So, what happened anyway, Fukki?\r\nKofuki: This here!\r\nMihono: Your jacket?\r\nTsugumi: Oh? It's slightly torn.\r\nMihono: Ah, it is!\r\nKofuki: It got caught on that branch.\r\nTsugumi: I see, so that's why. Though, it's hardly a problem, is it? You have lots of similar jackets you can go back and get.\r\nKofuki: Doesn't matter; what pisses me off pisses me off!\r\nMihono: Then, how about next day we have off, we go clothes shopping together?\r\nKofuki: Clothes shopping? I haven't been in a while, so that sounds good.\r\nMihono: Nice! You should come too, Tsugumi-san! It's a date!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Aradama Hoodie - Kofuki: End]: On To the Shopping!\r\n\r\nMihono: And with that, we're here, Harajuku!\r\nKofuki: Yawwn...

Thanks...\r\nMihono: Ah.\r\nKofuki: BFWOO-!?\r\nKofuki: Oi, what'd you feed me!!\r\nTsugumi: Just something simple to eliminate drowsiness.\r\nKofuki: Don't pass me toxic crap like it's no big deal! You're freaky.\r\nTsugumi: Am I?\r\nMihono: Fukki's looking wide awake now at least, so let's go buy some clothes!\r\n\r\nMihono: By the way, how do you pick out your clothes, Fukki?\r\nMihono: I remember Kiyoka saying, \"Fukki's got a great sense of style!\", so I've been curious ever since.\r\nKofuki: I just pick out whatever. Cruise around the shops and buy stuff...\r\n\r\nKofuki: See, like that? Ohm.\r\nMihono: You say, \"like that\", but... Where'd you find these hoodies?\r\nKofuki: They were in the middle of the store, remember? [chew chew]\r\nMihono: I didn't see it... Nnn, this kind of thing's pretty cute too.\r\nKofuki: It looks good on you, Mihocchi. This's good.\r\nMihono: Thanks, Fukki.\r\nTsugumi: It's somewhat embarrassing the way we all match though, isn't it?\r\nKofuki: You think so? [chew chew] Mm-!\r\nMihono: ...That crepe must be yummy, huh.\r\nKofuki: ...[grin] Mihocchi, you want a bite?\r\nMihono: Can I?\r\nKofuki: Sure, but you get one bite, alright? Here... Open wide.\r\nMihono: Ahh-... Nngh!?\r\nMihono: Hey, Fukki! Weren't you gonna let me have some!?\r\nKofuki: Ahahahahaha! If you wanted to eat some, then go buy it yourself, Mihocchi.\r\nTsugumi: Ohm. ...[chew chew] I see, it is fairly good.\r\nKofuki: Hey, don't you go eating it!\r\nMihono: Now's my chance... Mmm-, so good!\r\nKofuki: Mihocchi too!? Ahh, damnit! Gimme back the bits you ate!\r\nMihono: How am I supposed to do that when I ate it!\r\nTsugumi: You could just go buy another one, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: Like you can talk when you're the one who went and ate it-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/bUqlN1QeE1o\r\n[Stage Girl - Kanami: Start]: Somebody I Want to Spar With!\r\n\r\nMaya: Now then, I'll have you leave the stage. --HAAH!\r\n\r\nKaren: YAH!\r\nKaren: Nice!

They fight differently from a toji, but I'm enjoying myself just watching them go!\r\nYui: Ahh... You can't help but be captivated by them, can you~.\r\nYui: Would you call it their posturing? Every one of the motions they go through grabs hold tight of my heart... It's so good!\r\nKanami: Yeah, I know just what you mean! Ahh, even if only for a little bit, I want to spar with all the stage girls!\r\nKaren: Kanami-chan, Kanami-chan, what's \"spar\" mean?\r\nKanami: Ah, sparring is when you face off... It's a practice match!\r\nKaren: A practice match, huh~. I think I might wanna have one too!\r\nFutaba: It'd be useful reference material for sword fights on stage, wouldn't it.\r\nKaoruko: Sure would. Though, I'm not about to join you.\r\nKanami: Sure! You only have to join in if you want to! I don't think it's good to force training in.\r\n\r\nHikari Slipping through my firmly raised hands, the vow we made that day fell into the abyss. I once again climb towards my stage of destiny. Even if it must end in tragedy... 99th generation, Kagura Hikari. It is all for the sake of Starlight!\r\nKanami: Wow-, being able to recite a line like that so smoothly; people training to be pros sure are something else.\r\nHikari: I am a stage girl, so this much is natural.\r\nKanami: Even still, it's pretty amazing.\r\nKanami: Oh yeah, thanks, Hikari-chan.\r\nHikari: What? Why are you thanking me suddenly?\r\nKanami: For sparring with me. I'm really happy you agreed!\r\nHikari: I just thought this experience might be useful on the stage. Are you ready?\r\nKanami: I'm ready to go anytime!\r\nHikari: Then... --YAH!\r\nKanami: That was a nice thrust, Hikari-chan! Now I'll go! HAAH!\r\nHikari: ...Kh! Then, I'll--!\r\nHikari: ...You're watching my movements closely.\r\nKanami: That's good! Show me more and more, Hikari-chan, of the way that you fight!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Stage Girl - Kanami: End]: It Is All for the Sake of Starlight!\r\n\r\nHikari: ...There-!\r\nKanami: !? That was a little risky just now!\r\nKanami: You're using the spring in your body to get even sharper with your strikes! That was a great thrust!\r\nHikari: ...You were able to dodge that just now? Toji really do have great physical performance.\r\nKanami: It's important to be able to avoid taking hits in battle, after all. That's a part of training too.\r\nHikari: Then, what will you do if I do this?\r\nKanami: Eh!? You threw your weapon!?\r\nHikari: Thank you. You deflected it just how I wanted you to.\r\nKanami: Wawah!? ...She's flying with a wire!?\r\nHikari: And now--!!\r\n\r\nKanami: Seeing that attack just now you did with the wire sent a chill up my spine-. You were right up in front of me all of a sudden.\r\nKanami: So you can fight like that too, huh!\r\nHikari: ...You blocked it so easily though.\r\nKanami: I mean, if I didn't block that right, I'd be done for. It wasn't easy for me at all.\r\nHikari: There's something I want to ask you... Why did you decide to have a match with me?\r\nKanami: Because I saw you not even flinching as you were fighting aradama, I guess.\r\nHikari: That should be the same for the other stage girls too. We all want the auditions to resume soon.\r\nKanami: You're right, but you were still a little different after all. I think it would be scary to fight with that short sword-like dagger, Hikari-chan.\r\nKanami: But still, you have a strong determination to fight. That's the feeling I got. So that's why I wanted to spar with you.\r\nHikari: ......\r\nKanami: And once we got down to it, it was super exciting!\r\nKanami: Ah! I wish I could try moving around with wires like you did, Hikari-chan-.\r\nHikari: You can't; I won't give it to you.\r\nKanami: I can't-? That's a bit of a shame!\r\nKanami: Hey. Hikari-chan, what did you think of sparring with me?\r\nHikari: Hm, real swordfighting was incredible. Teach me. Even if it's only the basic movements.\r\nKanami: Sure thing! I'll welcome anybody interested in swordfighting with open arms! We'll start with your stance, okay?\r\nHikari: This kind of seems like it could take a while...

Shidou Maki and Konohana Suzuka have arrived.\r\nYukari: Good, you're here.\r\nYukari: I'll explain to you the details concerning a great project about to be put underway.\r\nYukari: We received an offer from an international organization to appoint a \"Toji Representative\", to be an ambassador of peace and goodwill toward the world.\r\nMaki: A toji representative...!?\r\nYukari: This is a sign that the world has begun to recognize the accomplishments of toji.\r\nSuzuka: By what manner will we be deciding on the toji representative?\r\nYukari: I've received a list of referrals for prospective candidates from each president of the Five Traditions.\r\nYukari: From the Minoseki Academy: Inago, Etou, Yanase, Asakura.\r\nYukari: From the Heijou Institute: Juujou, Iwakura, Musumi.\r\nYukari: From Osafune Girls' Academy: Setouchi, Kohagura, Mashiko.\r\nYukari: From Renpu Girls' School: Ban, Shichinosato, Itomi.\r\nYukari: From Ayanokouji Martial Arts School: Kitora, Yamashiro.\r\nYukari: From the elite guard: Shidou, Konohana, Satsuki, Tsubakuro.\r\nYukari: To decide on a representative from the aforementioned members, we will hold a \"Miss Five Traditions\" Selection Tournament.\r\nMaki: A... Miss Five Traditions Selection Tournament?\r\nYukari: The judging will be divided into three categories.\r\nYukari: To compete in the beauty of their swordsmanship, a \"performance\". To display a toji's indispensable organizational skills, a \"group examination\". To express their feelings regarding their services toward society, a \"speech\".\r\nYukari: It would only be fitting to call the one who gains the most support through all categories \"Miss Five Traditions\"; someone who can act as an ambassador of spirit, vitality, and peace to the youth of the world.\r\nMaki: It would certainly be a total test of one's talents as a toji then...\r\nMaki: As members of the elite guard, we can't afford to give a bad example here, can we, Suzuka.\r\nSuzuka: That's true. This is a fine opportunity to demonstrate to the public our regular dedication to improving ourselves.\r\nYukari: I will be there as well, on the day of the competition. I have high expectations that the nominated toji will put their best efforts.\r\n\r\nAfter Yukari announced the details of the \"Miss Five Traditions\" Selection Tournament, word spread in a flash among the toji.\r\n\r\nMihono: Being an ambassador of peace toward the world sounds kinda amazing, doesn't it!\r\nMihono: And also, I'm really happy everyone in the investigation team got chosen as \"Miss Five Traditions\" candidates too.\r\nMihono: Cause, this means all the effort we're putting in is getting recognized!\r\nMirja: There's no doubt that we have gained a certain value to our reputation.\r\nMirja: And, at the same time \"Miss Five Traditions\" will be decided upon, the morale of toji will be raised... This is a well thought out event.\r\nMihono: I'll give my best shot at becoming \"Miss Five Traditions\"-! It might be tough, but, where there's a will, there's a way-!\r\nChie: Fufu. Seeing you ready to give it your all like that, I can't let myself be outdone here.\r\nYui: The selection tournament is going to have a, \"Badump-! A great big all girls sports day!\" feeling, right? I mean, of course it'll be like that!\r\nMirja: You would be wrong. In the first place, they already announced the categories they will be judging us on.\r\nMirja: You should look over them as soon as you can, Yamashiro Yui. Every toji will likely be taking this seriously.\r\n\r\nAkira: Yo.\r\nKaoru: Yo-, didn't expect to run into you here.\r\nEllen: That reminds me, I saw the list of candidates for \"Miss Five Traditions\".\r\nEllen: You were picked out for it too, weren't you? I was surprised to see you joining in an event like this.\r\nAkira: Yeah-. I wasn't sure if I'd be doing it, or whatever.\r\nKaoru: Makes you want to do anything to get out of it, huh-. I get that feeling.\r\nKaoru: Hey, how about we skip the day of the tournament together?\r\nAkira: Y'know, I'm not into that type of half-assed attitude.\r\nAkira: We got picked out of the whole Five Traditions. And that means we've gotta put in a good showing for the rest of everybody else.\r\nKaoru: S-Sure. Didn't expect you to be so serious about this.\r\nAkira: (The higher ups didn't put their foot down for this tournament... Which should mean it's fine if I go.)\r\nAkira: (So, why not go wild with it!)\r\n\r\nAnd thus, each harboring their own respective feelings, the toji came to compete for the position of \"Miss Five Traditions\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Let the \"Miss Five Traditions\" Selection Tournament Begin!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so, the day of the \"Miss Five Traditions\" Selection Tournament came.\r\n\r\nMihono: Mmm-, today's the perfect day for a tournament!\r\nMihono: I'll give it my best shot at becoming \"Miss Five Traditions\", yeah-!\r\nAnnouncement: Inago Akira-san. If you have arrived at the tournament hall, please let the administrator's office know at once--\r\nKofuki: Huhh, so somebody's not even here yet. Actually, that should've been me.\r\nKofuki: Let me hunt some aradama instead of playing along with this junk-.\r\n\r\nAt that moment.\r\n\r\nAkira: Ah-... I'm for sure getting stuck in traffic here.\r\nAkira: And after I went outta my way to leave at a different time. No use. Guess I'll try a back road.\r\nAkira: The tournament's gonna be starting around now. I've gotta hurry--\r\n\r\nAnnouncer: Now then, the first round of judging, \"Performance\" will hereby begin.\r\nMihono: Alright, it's finally starting! Let's make it a good competition, guys!\r\nKanami: Yeah! I'm going out there then!\r\n\r\nKanami: HAAAAH--!\r\n\r\nMihono: Kanami, that's amazing...!\r\nKiyoka: Her performance is beautiful, like she's flowing through the motions... I can't take my eyes off her.\r\nChie: But along with that, her movements look so sharp they could slice the air apart. She's naturally gifted, isn't she...\r\nSayaka: That's how good Kanami is. But, I won't lose.\r\nYukina: Sayaka. Show everyone in the hall the might of Renpu Girls' School.\r\nSayaka: I will.\r\n\r\nSayaka: HAA--!\r\nYukina: The toji here couldn't possibly compete with Sayaka.\r\nKanami: That was a great performance, Sayaka-chan!\r\nSayaka: Thank you.\r\nAnnouncer: Please pardon this interruption of the judging. Inago Akira-san. If you have arrived at the tournament hall, please let the administrator's office know at once--\r\n\r\nAkira: Like I figured, this way's got hardly any traffic. I might make it only a bit late now...\r\nAkira: Huh? My tire popped!? I'm still nowhere near the tournament either!\r\nAkira: Am I supposed to push now... Damnit...\r\n\r\nKiyoka: It's going to be my turn soon... I-It's making me nervous...\r\nChie: You'll don't have to work yourself up over it so much, Kiyoka-chan.\r\nChie: After all, this isn't a battle, so how about you show them just how much you've grown?\r\nKiyoka: Chie-san...\r\nChie: Anyway, I have to go out now. Please cheer me on.\r\n\r\nChie: After the advice I gave Kiyoka-chan, as her onee-san, I'll have to give it my best attempt.\r\nChie: HAA--!\r\nKiyoka: Wow, she's incredible...\r\nMihono: You can do it, Chii-nee!\r\nKiyoka: From watching Chie-san's performance, I feel like I've calmed down a little... But, my heart still won't stop racing.\r\nKiyoka: I have to do a performance here, in front of all these people...\r\nKofuki: Can't you just do whatever out there? You take this stuff so seriously.\r\nKofuki: Actually, I'm up next, aren't I? This's lame, so maybe I'll bail.\r\nKiyoka: Y-You're going to leave!? Please don't go...!\r\nKofuki: Why not. Isn't it all the same if I'm here or not?\r\nKiyoka: But... It makes me feel, discouraged...\r\nKofuki: Tch... Fine, whatever. I just have to go out there, right?\r\n\r\nKofuki: What's so fun about this waste of time... Here goes.\r\nKofuki: That good enough for you? Aghh-, so lame.\r\nMihono: Uwah-... Fukki, you didn't even try at all, did you.\r\nChie: It was very like her though... Ah, Kiyoka-chan's performance is next.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: [inhale, exhale]... [inhale, exhale]...\r\nKiyoka: (Thanks to Kofuki-san, I feel like I can be a little braver...)\r\nKiyoka: (If my friends are here with me, then I know, even I can do it...!)\r\nKiyoka: Here I go...!\r\nMihono: Ooh-... Way to go, Kiyoka!\r\nChie: Mm, it was a nice performance that expressed all the effort she's put in.\r\nKofuki: If she was gonna go and do all that, why couldn't she just do it from the start.\r\nKiyoka: Ah, Kofuki-san!\r\nKiyoka: I was able to try my best because you stayed... Thank you very much!\r\nKofuki: Hey, I've got nothing to do with this.\r\nMihono: Isn't the last performance yours, Konohana-san? Good luck out there!\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, thank you. Well then, I'll be going.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: So in a showcase of the beauty cultivated in our swordsmanship, I'll be last to perform...\r\nSuzuka: As an elite guard, as a toji, I can hardly put on a shameful performance now.\r\nSuzuka: Konohana Suzuka will now begin-- HAAH!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Woww... Her performance is so elegant...\r\nChie: When they say, \"to flow like water\", I suppose this is exactly what they mean... What else can you expect from the elite guard.\r\nMihono: Yeah... With how great all the performances were, it wouldn't be crazy if anybody won!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: School Separated Opposition Battle\r\n\r\nAnnouncer: Continuing on, everyone will be divided by their respective schools so they may display their tactics as a unit in this \"group examination\".\r\nAnnouncer: Now then, ready, start!\r\nYume: Ahahahahah! Here I go-!\r\nToji A: Tsubakuro Yume of the elite guard is moving up quickly!\r\nToji B: If we draw her out here, we can finish this! All members, forward!\r\nYume: Hmmm, so you're trying to outnumber me. That's fine.\r\nYume: I'll tear through you one by one-- I'll show off just what makes me so great!\r\nMaki: That's our Yume. Even surrounded by toji from other schools, she treats it like it's nothing.\r\nSuzuka: Though, I feel leaving things as they are won't give room to gauge our organizational skills.\r\nMaki: No need to worry about that. The strength of the elite guard isn't just in those who push out.\r\nYomi: There is an ambush waiting behind the cover ahead. I'll attack pre-emptively.\r\nToji C: Kh, we got spotted...? Uwahhh!\r\nYume: Thanks, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYomi: You don't need to thank me. I only did what I needed to, as an elite guard.\r\nMaki: Yume's wild movements, and Yomi's precise support of her. That's just another part of group tactics, isn't it?\r\nSuzuka: We can't simply stay here admiring them either. We need to move up as well.\r\nMaki: Right, let's go!\r\n\r\nMai: If we hold them off at the front line here, the momentum will push toward the elite guard--\r\nMai: Kanami-chan, keep Tsubakuro-san back!\r\nKanami: I'm on it-!\r\nYume: Onee-san!\r\nKanami: I'm not letting you go any further, Yume-chan!\r\nYume: Ahahah, this is fun, right!\r\nKanami: Yeah!\r\nMai: I can see a group appraching from the south-- All members, spread out into two units!\r\nMai: Leave this here to Kanami-chan and perform a pincer attack to the south! Mihono-chan, take care of the other unit!\r\nMihono: Got it-!\r\n\r\nEma: Yanase-san is as resourceful as always. With her control over myougan, she can give commands based on her understanding of the situation in all directions.\r\nEma: When put in charge of a raiding unit, I don't know that any toji could get the better of her.\r\n\r\nMihono: The toji over there still haven't noticed me yet...\r\nMihono: Which means, first come, first serve-! TAAAAH-!\r\nToji A: A-A surprise attack!?\r\nToji B: They're counterattacking! Intercept-!\r\nMihono: Too late-!\r\n\r\nMihono: Kanami and Mai are both pretty great, aren't they... You can tell, standing on the same battlefield as them.\r\nMihono: I can't let them beat me either!\r\n\r\nMirja: The battle is becoming more chaotic... Ayanokouji's line is falling back.\r\nMirja: Don't falter, Kitora Unit! Suzumoto Hana, Hasui Mayumi, take the vanguard and push the battle forward!\r\nMirja: Nakano Jun, preserve the main unit; Yamashiro Yui, guard the rear!\r\nYui: Yes ma'aaam-!\r\n\r\nYuzuki: --So they've rallied from a disadvantageous position.\r\nYuzuki: Commands issued with faith in each member, arranging the unit to best make use of their skills-- Just as I've come to expect of you, Mirja.\r\n\r\nKaoru: Oh...? Those guys from Ayanokouji, they've started fighting the ones from Renpu.\r\nKaoru: Osafune Squad, take the chance to run away-. We don't have to fight a pointless fight here.\r\nToji A: R-Right!\r\n\r\nSana: Hey, don't take the initiative to run when you're the commander!\r\nSana: Though, considering it's Kaoru, she probably won't come away without gaining anything...\r\n\r\nEllen: Are you sure about this, Kaoru? You're going to get a talking to from Sana-sensei later.\r\nKaoru: It's fine; this is just thinking two steps ahead is all-.\r\nKaoru: See, now Heijou Institute's unit's in shambles. If we move over there, we can create an opening.\r\nKaoru: So anyway, go get 'em-.\r\nToji A: H-Huh? Osafune Unit is moving here at speed!\r\nChie: Please don't think too badly of us for this. YAAA-!\r\nHiyori: --I'm not about to let you.\r\nChie: Juujou-san...!\r\nEllen: Hiyoyon!\r\nKiyoka: I-I'll back you up, Juujou-san...!\r\nHiyori: Thanks. Come on, let's make our counterattack.\r\nToji A: Renpu Unit is approaching from the right!\r\nSanae: Understood! If we can stop them here, Renpu Unit should run out of steam...\r\nSanae: Take a close formation with our backs to the wall! We'll withstand this and find a good opportunity!\r\nToji A: Right-!\r\n\r\nIroha: That's the way. By restricting the enemy's space to move, you won't be so easily broken through...\r\nIroha: To find victory from defense is a very appropriate style of fighting for her.\r\nEma: The state of the battle is getting awfully mixed up.\r\nSana: Now then, whose side is it going to turn in favor of?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Put Your Feelings in Your Speech\r\n\r\nAnnouncer: The third judging category will be a speech. Your speech's theme will be: \"What you hope to accomplish as a toji.\"\r\nAnnouncer: Please share with us your dreams, as well as your thoughts regarding your contributions to society.\r\nMihono: What we hope to accomplish as toji...\r\n\r\nMaki: This is Shidou Maki, first seat of the elite guard.\r\nMaki: As a toji, what I hope to accomplish is to reach a future where everyone can laugh together.\r\nMaki: The threat posed by aradama still runs deep, and I understand it won't be as simple as it sounds.\r\nMaki: Even still, I have many allies with me here. There have been harsh battles I was able to overcome only because of the friends I had at my side.\r\nMaki: And, as an elite guard, I've come to understand how admirable it is to protect you all.\r\nMaki: I believe a great future is waiting ahead for us... And I intend to keep walking the path toward it. That's all. Thank you for listening.\r\n\r\nMihono: Ohh~... Shidou-san did as good as you'd expect! She's got the attitude of a first seat-!\r\nYui: That was too beautiful! I knew it; I love Maki-san too! Okay, now it's my turn!\r\nMihono: Good luck, Yui!\r\n\r\nYui: I'm Yamashiro Yui, a second year in the middle school division at Ayanokouji Martial Arts School.\r\nYui: There's something that's been on my mind this whole time, ever since the first day I became a toji.\r\nYui: And that's... All these girls who're toji, they're all so cute!\r\nYui: There's good looking girls of every type, and their serious faces when they're fighting are so dreamy... Don't you think this situation is just too perfect?\r\nMihono: Yui... Even in a place like this, she doesn't change.\r\nYui: And, what I enjoy most of all is getting in the baths with everyone!\r\nYui: I get to relax in there, charge up my energy, and we can do this and that to deepen our friendship! You know, this and that-!\r\nYui: Getting to be surrounded by alllll these amazing girls, I'm the happiest person in the world!\r\nYui: Miku. I don't know how exactly it'll get to you, but I know you're going to hear this speech, won't you?\r\nYui: Like you heard me say, I'm doing just fine. Because I'm having fun doing my job as a toji.\r\nYui: Ah, about Miku, she's my super cute little sister! That's all-!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: That was a nice speech.\r\nYui: Thank you very much, Tsugumi-san!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Hello. I'm Ban Tsugumi, a second year in Renpu Girls' School's high school division.\r\nTsugumi: Ordinarily, I work with the aradama research team I'm a part of.\r\nTsugumi: I compile information to build a database on aradama, and occasionally go to collect data myself.\r\nTsugumi: Unlike the other girls, I may be poor at expressing myself, but I am surrounded by a supportive team and curious colleagues.\r\nTsugumi: Many times have I been brought out to support these unthinkable friends of mine, however... I don't think those days are so bad.\r\nTsugumi: In the days to come, I'd like to continue gathering much more data.\r\n\r\nMihono: Tsugumi-san, you said you couldn't express yourself, but... I thought you expressed yourself really well!\r\nTsugumi: I know. That was a bit of humor.\r\n\r\nHiyori: Third year in middle school at the Heijou Institute. Juujou Hiyori.\r\nHiyori: I'm honestly not very good with this sort of thing, but... I think I'll talk a little about myself today.\r\nHiyori: Ever since I can remember, I've done nothing but train my skills.\r\nHiyori: I spent my days pursuing only strength and my own ideals. I thought that would go on always.\r\nHiyori: But, now... My days are far more fulfilling than I ever could have imagined back then.\r\nHiyori: And that's all because of the allies I have with me. No, I guess I should call them my friends.\r\nHiyori: Rather than only working to improve myself, I can feel that finding the time to laugh together over foolish things is just as important.\r\nHiyori: Every day I find a new side of myself that even I never realized was there.\r\nHiyori: There will probably be lots of changes in my future, and maybe that's what people call growing up. But I'm also looking forward to seeing what \"new me\" will come next.\r\n\r\nEllen: Nn~, that was a good speech, Hiyoyon! I'm going to have to try to to be outdone! \r\n\r\nEllen: Ah-, test, test. I'm Kohagura Ellen, a first year in high school at Osafune Girls' Academy!\r\nEllen: This has to do with the theme of, \"what you hope to accomplish as a toji,\" but I'm going to start with a quick story.\r\nEllen: When I was little, I always couldn't wait to hear what stories Grandma would tell me.\r\nEllen: With a dream forming in my young heart, you could say it was only natural I would yearn to see the Japan filled with wonders I had heard about.\r\nEllen: And, when I came to Japan... It was a wonderland even greater than I had pictured! I felt inspired by the okatana wielding toji--\r\nEllen: And, seeing up close the friendship that could be formed between people and aradama, I thought, how fantastic is that!\r\nEllen: The dream I've always had was to make an aradama park and tours of the netherworld a reality.\r\nEllen: It might be a faraway dream at this point, but I'll absolutely make it come true someday!\r\n\r\nMihono: Everyone's speeches are so great... \r\nMihono: Just from listening to them, I've feeling hyped up too!\r\nEllen: Okay, Mihomiho. You're the last to go!\r\nMihono: Right-!\r\n\r\nMihono: Umm, I'm Asakura Mihono, a second year in middle school at the Minoseki Academy.\r\nMihono: This might seem out of nowhere, but my motto is, \"Leap before you look!\"\r\nMihono: With my job as a toji, and with this okatana... I've done my best so far thinking I might have the power to make somebody happy.\r\nMihono: I've seen lots of tough enemies, and been through lots of close calls.\r\nMihono: But, during those times, what kept me going was one thought deep in my heart.\r\nMihono: I don't know how to say anything that sounds great yet. But, still!\r\nMihono: Maybe I can't understand all the hard stuff, but I'll keep trying my best every day!\r\nMihono: Whatever trouble I run into, together with my friends, I've been able to leap before I look out of it.\r\nMihono: From now on, so long as I'm with everyone, I know I'll be able to go as far as I can-- Because I believe, \"where there's a will, there's a way!\"\r\n\r\nYui: You stole it away at the end, Mihono-chan. That hit the spot!\r\nMaki: True. The volume of the applause shows you just how much the audience expects of Asakura Mihono.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Whose Hand Will Take the Glory\r\n\r\nAfter all the judging had been concluded, the toji each waited for the results to be announced.\r\n\r\nKanami: You all did great, everybody-!\r\nMai: You too. We've done all we can now.\r\nMai: It's good we were able to have such a satisfying tournament, since we did the best we could with our current ability.\r\nKanami: It was neat getting to learn things about each other I never knew before too!\r\nHiyori: I get the feeling I talked a bit too much though...\r\nSanae: Really? I thought it was great to hear.\r\nKaoru: This whole tournament was just an excuse to get us to work unpaid overtime, wasn't it-. Feels like working over the weekend.\r\nEllen: Now now, Kaoru. Making wonderful memories like these is priceless.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan, good work on your performance. You must be hungry, aren't you?\r\nSayaka: Mm, a little.\r\nMai: I baked cookies, so here. If you'd all like, why don't we all share them together?\r\nKanami: Can we? Thanks, Mai-chan! I'll have some-!\r\n\r\nKofuki: Sigh, that's fiiinally over with. Oi, get some aradama-chan ready for me.\r\nTsugumi: Understood. Please give me a moment.\r\nKiyoka: You two have gone right back to usual, haven't you.\r\nKiyoka: Umm-, aren't you curious about the results being announced?\r\nKofuki: Yeah right. It's not like I even planned on becoming \"Miss Five Traditions\" in the first place.\r\nKiyoka: What about if you were chosen, Tsugumi-san...?\r\nTsugumi: It would cut into the time I have for research, so I would want to turn it down.\r\nKiyoka: (That's how they both are... But, if I were chosen, what would I do...?)\r\nKiyoka: (It's no use! After all, I know someone like me could never become \"Miss Five Traditions\"... But, still~...!)\r\n\r\nYui: Who do you think it'll be-; \"Miss Five Traditions!\"\r\nYui: They'd probably get a bunch of cute outfits and things for her, right?\r\nMirja: I doubt those would be anything like the outfits you're imagining, Yamashiro Yui.\r\nChie: Mihono-chan, with how good your speech was, you might even be picked to be \"Miss Five Traditions\".\r\nMihono: Ehh-, you think so? But, everybody else's were great too, and yours was amazing, Chii-nee, so I think it wouldn't be weird if anybody won!\r\nMihono: What'd really make me happy is if somebody from the investigation team ended up getting picked as the winner!\r\nMihono: Ah-, now that I'm thinking about it, my heart won't stop pounding. I can't wait to see the results-!\r\nChie: Fufu, I know what you mean... Oh?\r\nChie: Look, outside. A girl is pushing a motorcycle up.\r\n\r\nAkira: [pant, pant]... I'm here, damnit...\r\nAkira: Though, it'll for sure be over at this point... Aghh-...\r\n\r\nYume: Hmmm, I wonder if I showed off enough to the judges.\r\nMaki: Sure you did. Though, while appealing to the judges is important for getting chosen to be \"Miss Five Traditions\", your general accomplishments as a toji are also taken into account.\r\nMaki: Considering the toji that were entered in the competition, everyone should still have a chance.\r\nSuzuka: I've done all that I can. The rest is in the hands of fate.\r\nYomi: Everyone, I've prepared omusubi if you'd like.\r\nYume: Yaaay, I'll have some-!\r\n\r\nAnnouncer: Thank you very much for waiting. The one selected to be \"Miss Five Traditions\" is...\r\n\r\nYou will decide who becomes Miss Five Traditions! By all means, please vote for your favorite toji!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: Keep Watching to See My Even Greater Side! ~Miss Five Traditions~\r\n\r\nAnnouncer: Everyone, thank you very much for waiting. The person selected to be \"Miss Five Traditions\" is...\r\nAnnouncer: Tsubakuro Yume-san!!\r\nAnnouncer: Congratulations on your victory! Please tell us how you are feeling now!\r\nYume: Thanks for picking me to be \"Miss Five Traditions\"!\r\nYume: But, I can be even greater than this! I'll show you even more of how great I am, so look forward to it!\r\nAnnouncer: Thank you for your comments!

Everybody tried really hard, so, no matter how it turns out, let's thank them!\r\nMihono: Or something like that!\r\nKofuki: Fine by me?\r\nChie: Then, I'll make us some food.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee's gonna cook!\r\nMihono: ...But wait, why don't we just go do karaoke?\r\nMihono: I do want to eat Chii-nee's cooking, but I want it to be something more casual and fun where we can let loose.\r\nChie: Fufu, you're just being considerate. Karaoke, hm. I'll look forward to it.\r\nMirja: That's right, I'll have to tune my throat beforehand.\r\nYui: I can't wait to hear Mirja-san's singing! Let's sing a duet together!\r\nKiyoka: Are you only going to be inviting the investigation team?\r\nMihono: Since we're doing this, I want to reach out to Kanami and them too.\r\nKiyoka: It would be more fun with everyone going, won't it? I'll talk to Juujou-san.\r\nChie: Then, I'll ask Kaoru-san and Ellen-san. Tsugumi-san, can you speak to Itomi-san about it?\r\nTsugumi: Understood. I'll ask Itomi-san.\r\nMihono: Alright-, Kiyoka, Yui, Fukki-! Let's go do karaoke now! We've gotta build up our stock of songs!\r\n\r\nMihono: Wait, that was what we talked about, so why'd it turn into a party at such a fancy place!?\r\nKanami: I heard the elite guard and Yukari-sama found out about it, and it sounds like Yukari-sama decided to hold a great big party to thank everyone.\r\nMihono: Our karaoke meetup turned into a real party!\r\nMihono: Hey, Kanami! Since Yukari-sama did this, that means she had to have gotten some yummy food for us, right!\r\nMihono: Mmmm, I can't wait!\r\nKanami: I know what you mean, Mihono-chan.\r\nMai: Kanami-chan, Mihono-chan, it seems like they have dresses ready for us over there.\r\nMihono: She got us dresses too!? Let's go quick, Kanami!\r\nKanami: Ah, wait up, Mihono-chan!?\r\nMai: You don't have to be in such a rush you two; they have enough for everyone...\r\nMai: They're already gone.\r\nSayaka: Mai?\r\nMai: Oh, Sayaka-chan.\r\nSayaka: Kanami and Mihono were running. Did something happen?\r\nMai: Nothing's happened, you don't have to worry. More importantly, what did you need?\r\nSayaka: I came to get you.\r\nMai: Thank you. I'm looking forward to seeing the dresses.\r\nSayaka: Mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Dress 20 - Mihono: End]: Earrings and a Necklace\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, I'm going on ahead.\r\nMihono: Okay-, I'll be out in a minute.\r\nKiyoka: Alright!\r\nMihono: (It's just me and Itomi-san left, huh.)\r\nMihono: (I just need to put this ear piercing in, and... There! It's all set!)\r\nMihono: Okay, Itomi-san, I'm going to get going too now.\r\nSayaka: ...\r\nMihono: Itomi-san? What's wrong?\r\nSayaka: I can't attach this necklace right.\r\nMihono: Necklace?\r\nMihono: ...Ah.\r\nSayaka: I'll be okay, so you can go, Mihono.\r\nMihono: Since I'm already here, let's go together. Could I see your necklace? I'll put it on for you.\r\nSayaka: ...Okay.\r\nMihono: Doing this much is no big deal. And besides, this necklace; it's cute, isn't it!\r\nSayaka: Thank you, Mihono. Your earrings are cute too.\r\nMihono: Ahaha, thanks! There, it's on!\r\nMihono: Okay, let's go!\r\nSayaka: Mm.\r\nMihono: Huh, did somebody come back? I'm coming-.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee and Mai?\r\nChie: I thought, if you were still getting ready, I could give a hand, but... It looks like you're fine.\r\nMai: You look like you're finished too, Sayaka-chan.\r\nMai: ...Mmhm, you look very cute.\r\nSayaka: Thank you, Mai.\r\nSayaka: Mihono put this necklace on for me.\r\nMai: I see; Wasn't that nice of her.\r\nSayaka: Mm.\r\nChie: So you were late because you were helping Itomi-san finish up.\r\nMihono: There was that too, but it's mostly because I couldn't decide what earrings to go with. What do you think of these?\r\nChie: I like them; they look great on you, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Ehehe, I'm glad to hear it then!

I'm really excited for it!\r\nMai: (That girl, her name was... Etou-san, wasn't it? So she was looking forward to our swordfighting lessons that much...)\r\nMinoseki Academy Teacher: Looks like we've got a lively one with us. To start us off, we'll have you learn what your classmates are capable of.\r\nMinoseki Academy Teacher: You'll be fighting against everyone... But first, pair up with the person next to you!\r\nKanami: I'll be in your care, Yanase-san!\r\nMai: S-Sure, likewise.\r\nMai: (We'll have to fight each of our classmates? Which would mean, I'll have to think about how to conserve my energy...)\r\nMinoseki Academy Teacher: Now then... Begin!\r\nKanami: ......\r\nMai: (Wait, she's not attacking?)\r\nMai: (That's sort of a let-down. With how she was acting, I thought she'd come straight at me as soon as we began...)\r\nKanami: I'm ready anytime.\r\nMai: (Her stance is... Seigan. It's so orthodox that there doesn't seem to be any scheme behind it. There's no need for tricks like that in our very first lesson anyway.)\r\nMai: (In which case... I'll go!)\r\nMai: YAAAAH!\r\nKanami: -!\r\nMai: ...Eh!?\r\nMai: (She dodged it... And so easily too...)\r\nKanami: There's hardly any wasted movements... You love swordfighting too, don't you, Yanase-san!\r\nKanami: Show me more of your swordsmanship!\r\n\r\nMinoseki Academy Teacher: That's enough!\r\nMai: Pant, pant...\r\nMai: (I wasn't any match for her at all...

Kanami-chan...\r\n\r\nFriend A: Mai's been together with Kanami all the time lately, hasn't she?\r\nMai: ...Eh?\r\nFriend B: Ah, I was thinking the same thing. Ever since that swordfighting lesson, right?\r\nFriend A: Well, Kanami was pretty amazing.\r\nMai: Th-That's only because... See, Kanami-chan may be strong, but, don't you think she's unsafe in some ways? Like, she might prioritize swordfighting over her own well being...\r\nFriend B: You say that, but isn't the truth that you just wound up having a crush on her?\r\nMai: I do not!! Don't go making assumptions like that!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Misogi- Mai: End]: The Name of This Feeling is Admiration\r\n\r\nFriend A: Eh, Mai...?\r\nMai: I-I'm sorry!

I'd better... apologize to her, shouldn't I...)\r\nMai: (But... I don't understand it myself, why I reacted like that... I could tell right away she was only joking...)\r\nMai: But, Kanami-chan...\r\nKanami: You called?\r\nMai: K-Kanami-chan!? Why are you...?\r\nKanami: Actually... I saw what happened before. And then, I followed you here.\r\nKanami: If it's alright with you, you can talk it over with me, okay?\r\nMai: ...Thank you, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: Why'd you get so mad? Can I ask you that?\r\nMai: That's because...\r\nMai: (I can't exactly tell her it's because they asked if I liked you, can I...)\r\nMai: It was my fault. They were only teasing me a little, but I got seriously upset...\r\nKanami: ...Was it because, they made fun of something important to you?\r\nMai: Eh?\r\nKanami: When I think, \"If it were me, what would I get mad if someone made fun of?\", it's got to be swordfighting of course!\r\nMai: Fufu, I could see that, Kanami-chan.\r\nMai: (But then... That means, I got upset because Kanami-chan is important to me?)\r\nKanami: And also... If somebody made fun of somebody you respect, you'd feel bad too, wouldn't you?\r\nMai: Someone you respect... Yeah, respect! That's it, Kanami-chan!\r\nMai: Thank you for letting me talk this over with you!\r\nKanami: Sure! Wait, huh?

You misunderstand!\r\nFriend A: ...It's not?\r\nMai: That's right. Kanami-chan, she's the first opponent I didn't think I could beat in swordfighting, so I respect her a lot.\r\nMai: But, when you teased me about it... I think that's why I couldn't help but get angry all of a sudden.\r\nFriend A: So that's what it was. It happens, huh.\r\nMai: We might be the same age, but... Kanami-chan was just so much stronger. That's why... Someday, I'd like to be about as strong as Kanami-chan.\r\nFriend B: She definitely is. We'll have to work real hard ourselves-.\r\nMai: Mmhm!

Cause you know, there's a life of taking the overnight bus north to south and back waiting for me ahead!\r\nKaoru: How'm I supposed to get through that without drinking this!\r\nNene: Nene!\r\nMai: Still...\r\nKaoru: Hey, Mai... Have you ever rode on an overnight bus?\r\nMai: I haven't...\r\nKaoru: See? It's a place where you can never get a good sleep, you'll get woken up at every service area, your strength gets worn down hour after hour...\r\nMai: Kaoru-chan...

It's good.\r\nKaoru: This big piece of chicken too, and that roast beef I had before, they used some pretty high grade meat, right?\r\nNene: Ne-?\r\nKaoru: Nn? Nene, you want this meat? You can't, it's mine.\r\nNene: Ne!\r\nKaoru: I'm the one who got it, so it's my meat!\r\nNene: Ne-...\r\nKaoru: Anyway, that dress looks good on you, Mai.\r\nMai: Thank you, Kaoru-chan. You look good in yours too.\r\nKaoru: What, this? They didn't have many dresses in my size, y'know-.\r\nMai: They didn't?\r\nKaoru: Yeah. They had a whole bunch in the size just above mine though.\r\nNene: NE--------!\r\nMai: Kyaa!\r\nKaoru: Nene stole my meat!?\r\nNene: Ne!\r\nKaoru: Stop it, Nene! That's my meat!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Dress - Mai: End]: Dress Close Call\r\n\r\nKaoru: Hey!

I'll get some more for you.\r\nKaoru: That's not gonna work! That was the last of the meat there!\r\nMai: Oh dear-...\r\nKaoru: And Nene, he knew that, and he still went after my meat!\r\nNene: Nene-!\r\nMai: S-Still, if you want meat, there's plenty of other kinds laid out...\r\nKaoru: But that's the last of that kind of meat!\r\nMai: Ah...\r\nKaoru: Kukuku, I've got you cornered now, Nene...\r\nKaoru: Okay, time to choose.

I'm surprised you knew.\r\nKuroko: I didn't think you interested in those experiments normally.\r\nMikoto: Well, it's fine every once in a while.\r\nMikoto: (There's no way I can tell her I got roped in because this company makes collab novelty Gekota merchandise that they don't sell anywhere...)\r\nKonori Mii: What will they be having you do, Misaka-san?\r\nMikoto: They need a fixed electric current... They asked me to provide an electromagnetic wave. An especially strong one.\r\nSaten Ruiko: That sounds like it could be kinda interesting. Can we go along to see?\r\nMikoto: Sure, I think that'll be fine?\r\nUiharu Kazari: Saten-san, didn't you say you'd be busy gathering gossip about that urban legend that there's a door to another world hidden in some school district?\r\nRuiko: It's fine, it's fine. Urban legends aren't going anywhere!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisitors (Gallery)\r\n\r\nMikoto: HAAAA...!\r\nRuiko: That's as incredible of an electric shock as ever, Misaka-san.\r\nKazari: I wonder what the theory is behind creating a new type of metal using electricity, anyway?\r\nRuiko: Beats me? I'm not all that interested in that stuff.\r\nKazari: Then... Why did you go and say we should come along?\r\nRuiko: Doesn't it sound kinda crazy that they're making a new type of metal? That's why, if we're doing it, I want to be there, you know?\r\nMii: It's good to have lots of interests. There's nothing wrong with those kind of motivations.\r\nMikoto: It really is easier getting into the experiment having you all here, as opposed to being surrounded by people I don't know.\r\nMikoto: So, I'm glad you came.\r\nKuroko: My very existence... Thinking of that as the source of Onee-sama's strength isn't so bad.\r\nMikoto: Kuroko... Couldn't you have phrased that better?\r\nKuroko: I have only stated the truth.\r\nShokuhou Misaki: Honestly... Thanks to you, Misaka-san, the static electricity is making my hair act funny. What a bother.\r\nMikoto: Shokuhou Misaki...! What are you doing here!?\r\nMisaki: Hmm-, just to see the sights?\r\nMikoto: Whatever... If you're going to complain, then just go.

All I did was go along with their experiment to create a new kind of metal.\r\nMikoto: Saten-san and Uiharu-san are okay too, so you should be fine...\r\nMikoto: Actually, where are Kuroko and Konori-senpai at?\r\nKuroko: The Kuroko you seek is right here, Onee-sama! And, just as you want me, I can be locked in your arms once more!\r\nMikoto: As if!!\r\nMii: Shirai-san. Isn't there something we should tell them first?\r\nKuroko: I suppose...\r\nMikoto: Did something bad happen?\r\nKuroko: Your vision still hasn't returned to normal, so you may not have noticed, but... This isn't where the experiment was taking place.\r\nRuiko: Eh... Then, where are we? Uiharu, can you look it up?\r\nKazari: Just... give me a minute. Huh, I can't get it to turn on!?\r\nMikoto: Let's just ask someone around here then.\r\nMikoto: Excuse me--\r\nScreaming People: UWAAHHHHH, ARADAMA!? G-GET OUT OF HERE!!\r\nMikoto: Eh... Wait...\r\nMisaki: Maybe it would have been for the best if someone besides Misaka-san had asked them?\r\nMikoto: ...I didn't even do anything!\r\nMii: More importantly, \"aradama\"? I'm curious what that means.\r\nRuiko: Umm... This is totally just going off my intuition here, but! Maybe they meant that!?\r\nAradama: ...GUOOOOOOOHHH!\r\nMikoto: Geez... And what's this, this weird thing! Let's go, Kuroko. Help me out.\r\nKuroko: Of course, I'll be right with you, Onee-sama.\r\nMisaki: Do your bestt.

Did you need something?\r\nMirja: This information is still unverified, but we've received a report that a group of citizens are fighting with aradama.\r\nMai: Eh!?\r\nMirja: As time was of the essence, Etou Kanami, Mashiko Kaoru, Setouchi Chie, Shichinosato Kofuki, and Iwakura Sanae have been sent to the scene.\r\nMaki: Ordinary citizens, fighting aradama; I can hardly believe it. ...Is there something strange going on? Just to be sure, we should go too.\r\n\r\nKanami: Still, why would they fight and not run away?\r\nKofuki: Seriously; those're my aradama-chan.\r\nKaoru: It's probably just some idiots wanting to test their courage. It happens every now and then.\r\nSanae: Whatever it is, we have to get there soon!\r\nChie: I can hear an aradama roaring. It's just up ahead!\r\nKanami: Whoa, why's the air all crackly!?\r\n\r\nAradama: GUGIII...!\r\nKuroko: Onee-sama-! It's getting up once again!\r\nMikoto: Seriously... Just how stubborn can they be! I'm going to hit it one more time!\r\nSanae: That's dangerous; please get back!\r\nMikoto: Huh?\r\nKanami: We'll take care of the rest here!\r\nKofuki: Out of my way! Those're all mine--!\r\nKuroko: Er... Who might you be? You aren't from Judgement, are you?\r\nKaoru: Judgement? We're toji.\r\nMikoto: \"Toji\"? What's that?\r\nChie: (...They don't know what toji are?)\r\nChie: Putting it simply, we're something like experts at suppressing those aradama you're fighting.\r\nRuiko: Sorry, we found a lost girl and took her with us, but what should we do about her?\r\nMii: Also, we weren't able to access the database to check evacuation guidelines, and we were in trouble since we couldn't call for help.\r\nChie: I understand. I'll call someone to help then.\r\nKaoru: Well, until help shows up, I'll guide her to somewhere safe the aradama can't get to.\r\nChie: Thank you, Kaoru-san. The rest of you should all hurry to safety as well!\r\nKazari: Why is it that they all have swords... They don't seem like some special tool for an ability enhancement test, do they?\r\nKuroko: Though, it looks as if they're telling the truth when they say they're specialists.\r\nAradama: GYAAAAAAAA...!\r\nKofuki: Hey, hey, what's wrong? You're not gonna satisfy me like that!\r\nSanae: Etou-san, I'll drive them over your way!\r\nKanami: Sure, I'm ready whenever!\r\nKanami: HAAA--!\r\n\r\nMaki: Etou, Mashiko, Iwakura, Shichinosato, Setouchi. Good work on making it here quickly and suppressing them. And then... You girls.\r\nYume: They're kinda weird, aren't they? They don't know about toji or aradama.\r\nRuiko: That was so cool, the way you were like, whoosh, with your swords! Girls with Japanese swords just have that appeal to them, don't they-.\r\nKazari: Saten-san, before you go off like that, we should make sure of what those aradama things were first.\r\nMai: Well, thinking over it, aradama are a sort of false organism created from a fusion of noro, I guess?\r\nMai: Without using the okatana we toji fight with, you won't be able to exorcise them. No matter what you attack them with.\r\nMikoto: So that's why they kept coming back every time I hit them with electric shocks.\r\nKuroko: Still, for Onee-sama, the electromaster, boasted as third rank in Academy City, to be unable to defeat them...\r\nMikoto: There are still some people my esper powers don't work on... Very very few of them though.\r\nKanami: Esper powers? You mean like, you can use telepathy or control fire, like you see in movies or manga?\r\nMikoto: What are you talking about? It's common knowledge that Academy City is working to develop esper powers.\r\nMirja: Academy City... Development of esper powers. I find this hard to believe all of a sudden.\r\nMii: Toji, and aradama... It seems there are many things we're both unfamiliar with. Perhaps we should start by confirming some things with each other.\r\nRuiko: Ah, before that, shouldn't we do the easy thing and all introduce ourselves? If we don't, it'll get confusing while we're talking.\r\nRuiko: I'm Saten Ruiko, a first year in Sakugawa Middle School! Nice to meet you! Okay, now Misaka-san!\r\nMikoto: I'm Misaka Mikoto. A second year in Tokiwadai Middle School. Nice to meet you.\r\nMisaki: Likewise, second year at Tokiwadai Middle School, Shokuhou Misaki. Misaka-san and I are verrry close~. Good to meet you all~.\r\nMikoto: Since when... Could you at least do your introduction right?\r\nMisaki: Awww, Misaka-san's so scaryy.\r\nKanami: So you two come from the same school. I'm Etou Kanami, a second year in the Minoseki Academy's middle school division. Nice to meet you!\r\nKuruko: Then, I will go next. I am Shirai Kuroko, a first year from Tokiwadai Middle School. And a member of one of Academy City's organizations for maintaining public order, Judgement.\r\nKuroko: Ah-! I can't believe myself; I nearly forgot to mention something important.\r\nKuroko: I also happen to be Misaka Mikoto-onee-sama's roommate at Tokiwadai's dorms. Pleased to make your acquaintance.\r\nKazari: ...Leave it to Shirai-san to go out of her way to let people know that.\r\nKazari: Ah. My name is Uiharu Kazari. I'm a member of Judgment, the same as Shirai-san, and also, a classmate of Saten-san's.\r\nMii: Then, it looks like I'm the last one on our side. I'm Konori Mii. Good to meet you.\r\nMii: Like Shirai-san and Uiharu-san, I work for Judgement.\r\nMii: Oh, and, come to think of it, I'm the only one in high school among us.\r\nKazari: She's our dependable senpai.\r\nMii: Thank you, Uiharu-san.\r\nMirja: Then, we should finish our introductions as well. I'm Kitora Mirja, second year in the high school division of Ayanokouji Martial Arts School.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Tamahagane?\r\n\r\nMikoto: With my power, it's like this.\r\nYume: That's so cool, Onee-san! It's all sparky and crackly!\r\nKaoru: They really do have esper powers.\r\nKuroko: Still, now things are finally clear. This may sound unbelievable, but... We've all arrived in a world without Academy City or esper abilities.\r\nMii: I'm sorry to ask for this, but is there any way you could provide for us a place to live for the time being?\r\nMaki: Of course. I'm sure you don't have anyone else to rely on, so we'll arrange a place for you to stay at the nearby Renpu dorms. You don't have to worry.\r\nMikoto: Thanks a lot. That really helps.\r\nChie: Anyway, Shidou-san. Everyone must be tired, so let's move over there.\r\n\r\nMirja: Now then, could you explain what it was you were all doing just before you came here?\r\nMikoto: Just before we ended up in this world, I was actually helping with an experiment to create a new kind of metal.\r\nMikoto: And then, after I made electric current, in just 10 seconds, we were blanketed in this white light...\r\nKuroko: The next thing we knew, we had been transported to this world.\r\nKaoru: I guess what sounds reasonable is, this metal you were trying to make might've been the cause?\r\nKaoru: What kind of metal was it?\r\nMikoto: Sorry, I don't know the details myself...\r\nMikoto: (And that's cause, after they said they'd give me corporate novelty Gekota merchandise... I got too excited and wasn't listening.)\r\nMisaki: If only Misaka-san would pay more attention to that sort of thingg.\r\nMisaki: That side of you can be so childish; it's a real botherr.\r\nMikoto: Wha!? Listen, you... I do feel a little responsible for this, but... Why'd you even have to come along in the first place!\r\nMisaki: Purely by chance. I just happened to have something to take care of at that research institute too.\r\nMirja: Misaka Mikoto, Shokuhou Misaki. We are getting off topic. Is there anything else you can remember?\r\nMikoto: Ah, come to think of it, the metal we were creating, I think they gave it the temporary name \"Tamahagane\"...\r\nChie: Eh, tamahagane?\r\nMikoto: ...Wait, huh? Is there something about tamahagane?\r\nChie: It might be a simple coincidence, but our okatana are made from a special iron sand known as tamahagane.\r\nChie: It's a word we're a little used to hearing, so I couldn't help but react.\r\nKazari: That sure is an interesting coincidence though.\r\nMaki: Mind if I butt in for a moment? Looking over the report from the noro recovery team just now, there's a detail I'd better tell you about.\r\nMaki: From the sound of things, they found an unidentified metal mixed in with the samples of noro, though only in small quantities.\r\nMikoto: Then... Does that mean what I think it does?\r\nMaki: It's not at the point we can speculate yet, but it is concerning.\r\nMai: In that case, why don't we have Ellen-san ask Friedman-san and the Special Rare Metals Utilization Research Institute to look into it?\r\nMai: This metal mixed in with the noro might be just what Misaka-san is talking about, after all.\r\nKaoru: It's best to leave what you don't get to the professionals.\r\nMisaki: What's the harm in asking? If they send it back to us, we can't do very much investigation ourselves, can we?\r\nMikoto: That's right; we'll follow any clues we can get. You're all okay with that, aren't you?\r\nMii: I think that's the best option we have available now.\r\nMai: Then, I'll get in touch with her right away.\r\nMaki: I'll get the procedures taken care of then, so the noro can be transported smoothly.\r\nSanae: In the meantime, everyone, would you like to have dinner? With all that's happened, I figure you must be hungry.\r\nRuiko: Ah-, that'd be great. I was starving, actually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Toji are Highly Busy\r\n\r\nSeveral days had passed since Mikoto and the others came to this world.\r\nThey offered to help gather from the aradama the tamahagane metal that their experiment had created.\r\n\r\nAradama: GGGIIIII...!!\r\nMikoto: Don't go running wild in the middle of town!\r\nAradama: Gu... Gguu...\r\nMai: The aradama's movements have slowed. Let's finish it off, Iwakura-san!\r\nSanae: Understood! --HAAAAAH!\r\nAradama: ......\r\nKuroko: What excellent coordination.\r\nSanae: Thanks for the help, Misaka-san.\r\nMikoto: You're welcome, but, I didn't do all that much.\r\nMai: We're plenty glad just to have you stopping their movments. Right?\r\nSanae: Exactly. It buys us time to get people to safety, and it makes it harder for the aradama to fight back. You're a huge help.\r\nMikoto: I'm just glad to be able to help somehow. This much is nothing to pay back what you've done for us, so whenever you're suppressing them, go ahead and give me a call.\r\nMai: Thank you. Now then, it looks like the noro is finished being recovered too, so why don't we head back to Renpu for now?\r\n\r\nRuiko: Ah, welcome back, Misaka-san, Shirai-san. You too, Yanase-san, Iwakura-san; good work out there.\r\nRuiko: How'd it go? The usual metal collection.\r\nMai: If I had to say one way or the other, it's going well. But, it isn't as if we're gathering lots of metal at once, so it could take a while.\r\nMikoto: I guess we have no choice but to go slow and steady. There's no use rushing it.\r\nMikoto: Though, the aradama... I'm a little surprised at how often they're appearing.\r\nKuroko: They show themselves so many times per day. Working as a toji must be challenging.\r\nChie: I'm sorry to have you two come with us to the fighting even though you aren't toji yourselves.\r\nMikoto: We're the ones who said we wanted to come along.\r\nChie: Even so, you shouldn't push yourselves, alright? If anything happens, don't hesitate to tell your onee-san here.\r\nRuiko: That's some impressive broad-mindedness you've got there... But, you won't beat out Konori-senpai!\r\nMii: Just what... kind of competition is that?\r\nMai: By the way, what have you been up to there, Uiharu-san?\r\nKazari: I asked the toji at Renpu to provide me with their data, and did a little looking into the distribution of appearances of aradama containing the newly created tamahagane metal.\r\nKazari: Please take a look. It seems like many of the aradama appearing in Kanto match those cases.\r\nMirja: I see; this is a discovery, isn't it.\r\nMirja: Hardly any were found outside the range of Kanto. We should be able to collect these metals to a more efficient degree using this.\r\nKazari: Sure; I thought I might be able to help out some, so I'm glad to hear it.\r\nMisaki: And I see even more appearing now. There really are too many aradama in this world of yours.\r\nMaki: Which toji can be dispatched there fastest...\r\nYume: I'll go-. If I leave it to Kuroko-onee-san, she can get me there in an instant, right? I wanna try teleporting!\r\nKuroko: I'd just like to make one thing clear, I am not an amusement park attraction, understand?\r\nMikoto: Don't be like that and let's get going, Kuroko! You too, Tsubakuro-san!\r\nKuroko: I suppose there's no helping it. Then, let me see the location information of where they appeared.\r\nKuroko: Now then, let's go. Are you two prepared?\r\nMikoto/Yume: Anytime!\r\nKofuki: Hey, take me with you! ...Or they're already gone, I guess. Don't go stealing my aradama-chan like that.\r\nChie: No matter how many times I see it, it still surprises me. These esper abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: What's the Reason for Why They Gather?\r\n\r\nAnd so, by cooperating with the toji, Mikoto and the others steadily gathered the metals the experiment seemed to have created.\r\n\r\nRuiko: Everyone's out on missions again today, huh.\r\nRuiko: With the aradama showing up every day, it figures they'd need special schools for raising toji.\r\nKazari: Academy City deals with some incidents of its own, but in this world, these are more like hard to prevent natural disasters.\r\nRuiko: Misaka-san and the others must be working hard too-. Hey, the chocolate mint ice cream they have here might also be pretty good!\r\nMisaki: Maybe soo. ...Mm, this is delicious too~.\r\nKazari: Still, doesn't it feel a little bad sitting in here eating sweets while all the toji are out working?\r\nMisaki: Uiharu-san, you're worrying too much~.\r\nMisaki: At times like these, the best thing to do is leave it all to those used to big flashy fights, like Misaka-san.\r\nMisaki: Besides, if we went to do something we aren't used to, we'd be nothing more than a burden, wouldn't we?\r\nRuiko: And also, you're already helping out here and there yourself, Uiharu.\r\nKazari: I'm not doing anything!\r\nMisaki: Neither am I, you knoww?\r\nKazari: Ah, Konori-senpai came in with Yanase-san and Iwakura-san.\r\nSanae: There you are. We were thinking of taking a short break. Do you mind if we sit with you?\r\nMisaki: Go right ahead-.\r\nMii: What were you three talking about?\r\nKazari: About how, all the toji are still students, but they're so responsible. It has to be tough, going out on missions every day.\r\nMai: It may be difficult, but this is just daily life here in our Japan.\r\nSanae: On top of that, exorcising aradama is an important duty for toji.\r\nMai: When you all came here and saw aradama for the first time, you tried to protect the people, didn't you?\r\nMai: I think that's far more incredible. Thanks to you, I'm sure there were people who could get to safety unhurt.\r\nSanae: Yeah. It would be normal for you to run away scared.\r\nKanami: So you were in here, Mai-chan.\r\nMai: Good work suppressing the aradama, you two.\r\nMirja: What are you drinking, by the way, Konori Mii?\r\nMii: Just milk. It doesn't seem like you have my favorite brand over here, so I took what I found.\r\nMirja: I see. I happen to like milk myself, but I never paid much attention to the brands I drink. You have distinctive tastes.\r\nMii: They aren't quite so distinctive as you think.\r\nMii: Anyway, did you find more of that metal during your work today?\r\nMirja: Yes. However, it's still proving difficult. We seem to need a specific amount to meet our goal, and what we've found is insufficient.\r\nKanami: We got less than I thought... I know you must all want to get home as soon as you can too.\r\nMisaki: That's nothing for you to feel bad about, Etou-sann. The only reason we can get them in the first place is thanks to you toji.\r\nKazari: That's right.\r\nMirja: This is...\r\nMirja: Everyone, this is a request for aid from Setouchi Chie, Shichinosato Kofuki, and Mashiko Kaoru's group, who were accompanying Misaka Mikoto and Shirai Kuroko today.\r\nMirja: It seems aradama are gathering there one after another, and the situation is urgent.\r\nKanami: Let's get over there on the double then!\r\n\r\nMikoto: There seriously is... just no end to them, is there. What's going on?\r\nKofuki: Business is booming today, huh?\r\nMikoto: I'm going to shock them into slowing down, so hang o--\r\nKofuki: Keep it to yourself!\r\nMikoto: Huh!? What do you mean!?\r\nKofuki: There's no challenge in playing with aradama-chan after they've been tripped up! You go help Chichie or something.\r\nKofuki: Come and show me a good time; gimme some fresh aradama-chan!\r\nKuroko: Honestly, what is her problem? Refusing Onee-sama's assistance like that.\r\nChie: Sorry about her. She just really loves fighting aradama is all...\r\nKaoru: I'd be glad for anything you can do to make things easier. Just keep making 'em sit still over here, Mikoto.\r\nKaoru: And then Chie'll take care of them all.\r\nChie: You'll be helping too, Kaoru-san.\r\nMikoto: Then, this'll sting--\r\nAradama: ......!\r\nKaoru: These ones are still squirming around.\r\nMikoto: ...I'll pay them a visit then!\r\nKaoru: Alright, until Kanami and them get here, I guess I'll work a little.\r\nKaoru: --KIEEEEEE!\r\nChie: If you could please keep it coming, just like that. --SEII!\r\nKuroko: Despite all her talk of skipping out, she does her job well, doesn't she.\r\nMikoto: ...And now, more showed up? If I just have to keep doing this, then...\r\nChie: It isn't normally like this though... I wonder why.\r\nKaoru: Kuroko-. If you think things're looking rough, take Mikoto and get out of here right away-.\r\nKuroko: I would do that regardless. Onee-sama's safety is my top priority.\r\nMikoto: HAAAAAAAH!\r\nKanami: Oh, good timing! Mai-chan, let's finish them off!\r\nMai: Sure. I'll be with you! --SEEEI!\r\nKuroko: Those two harmonize almost as well as Onee-sama and myself. As if they can read each other's minds.\r\nMikoto: You're not wrong. At least, about the part where they're in sync.\r\nMirja: They truly are gathering here... Shichinosato Kofuki must be overjoyed at the situation, but where is she?\r\nKofuki: Agh, why'd you guys come out here. Don't go taking my aradama-chan from me.\r\nMaki: You don't get a say in this. We'll all wipe them out at once. That's the most reliable way.\r\nMaki: Sorry, but it'd help if you lent us your power, Misaka.\r\nMikoto: Sure, you got it.\r\nYume: Well, it's not like it's that different for me whether the aradama get stopped or they're still moving-.\r\nKanami: With Yume-chan here, we've got the strength of a hundred people. Though, I'm not about to get outdone!\r\n\r\nSanae: As you'd guess, after all the aradama we defeated today, we managed to collect a lot of tamahagane.\r\nSanae: Though, why were those aradama appearing around Setouchi-san and the others, anyway?\r\nMaki: Did anything different from usual happen?\r\nKaoru: Nah, nothing I can think of. Right?\r\nMikoto: I can't think of anything either. I just gave my support like I always do.\r\nEllen: Big news, I have big news!\r\nMai: Ellen-chan? What's going on?\r\nEllen: Here's the story: we've found out something about this newly created tamahagane metal!\r\nEllen: It seems like, if you apply a fixed electromagnetic wave to it, it becomes easy to bond the metals together!\r\nEllen: Though, we don't know if this is the result of it being created from an applied electric current, or if it had these properties from the beginning.\r\nMikoto: An electromagnetic wave?\r\nKaoru: Oi... Don't tell me.\r\nKaoru: If there's aradama with that metal in them nearby, that won't make them come running, will it?\r\nEllen: Since we haven't investigated these aradama themselves, I can't say either way. But, I think there's a possibility. Since it was incorporated into the aradama, it must have kind of effect.\r\nMikoto: Then, the reason they kept gathering together today was because...\r\nYume: Cause Biribiri-onee-san was calling them all there?\r\nMikoto: C-Come to think of it... I was firing off electricity harder than usual, because there weren't many people nearby.\r\nMikoto: ...Is that what caused it!?\r\nEllen: Hmm hmm, I do think this is a very interesting case.\r\nMii: So long as we gathered lots as well, it all turned out alright, Misaka-san.\r\nMikoto: That's true, but... When I think of my own power causing trouble...\r\nMaki: This is just a layman's opinion, but, if Misaka's elecric shocks are gathering the aradama, could we not use that to bring them all to one place?\r\nRuiko: That's it! I think that's a great idea!\r\nKaoru: That might make dealing with this easier. If all goes well, we can could finish this up in one shot.\r\nKanami: If we take out all the aradama gathered there at once, it'll mean Misaka-san and the others can go home sooner.\r\nMikoto: None of us object to that. Right?\r\nKazari: I think it's a good plan.\r\nMisaki: It seems like Misaka-san is the cause of lots of problems, so you'll have to work hard enough to make up for it.\r\nMikoto: You don't have to chime in on every little thing... You're not doing anything either.\r\nMaki: It'd be best to get this taken care of as soon as we can. Tomorrow, we'll start preparing to carry out the operation.\r\nMaki: Kitora, Yanase, Iwakura, and Setouchi, I want you working together on the strategy.\r\nMaki: The rest of you are dismissed. Rest up for tomorrow!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Steel, a Flash of Light, and a Twist of Fate\r\n\r\nThe following day--\r\n\r\nKanami: Misaka-san, are you nervous?\r\nMikoto: No, not particularly. Ah, not to make it sound like I haven't been thinking this through...\r\nKanami: I get it. I know how much you've been helping us suppress aradama this whole time.\r\nKanami: We'll pull this off for sure; today's operation.\r\nMikoto: Of course!\r\nMikoto: Do you know where we're doing it? I think it'd be good to be someplace like yesterday, out in the mountains where there aren't many people around.\r\nMai: We do too. The plan is to have Misaka-san fire off her electricity and call the aradama to a place with little people nearby.\r\nMii: That would be the best strategy for avoiding casualties.\r\nRuiko: Wah!? Th-That surprised me...\r\nChie: Oh no... It looks like there's multiple appearances of aradama! These readings, they're increasing little by little?\r\nMaki: The site isn't far. All toji here will leave straight away. Misaka, it'd help if you came with us, just to be safe.\r\nMikoto: That's what I planned on from the start. Let's hurry! --Come on, Kuroko!\r\nKuroko: Of course, Onee-sama!\r\nKazari: ...Wait? Isn't this place where the aradama are appearing... It's right near where we first came to this world, isn't it?\r\nRuiko: Eh, weren't there a lot of people walking around there? ...Is this going to be okay?\r\nMisaki: Hmmm.\r\nMisaki: You knoww, since this might be the last time and alll, what do you think about going to take a look?\r\n\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOOO!!\r\nKofuki: What's going on here? Today's aradama-chan are biting at the bit! There's loads of 'em too!\r\nMirja: This isn't good... Evacuations haven't been fully completed yet. As things are now, the civilians will come under attack... Shichinosato Kofuki, Setouchi Chie, hold off that large aradama!\r\nKofuki: Leave it all to me!\r\nChie: You're going to take care of the evacuations, right, Mirja-san? We'll handle things here.\r\nMirja: It would be too optimistic to think aradama wouldn't approach civilians in the process of evacuating, after all.\r\nMikoto: Can I suggest something? What if Kuroko and I go around hitting the aradama one by one with my electricity, and Shidou-san and everyone follows along taking them out?\r\nKuroko: It can give you some time to help lead the evacuations. Onee-sama and I should be able to do that much.\r\nMaki: I hate to put you two in such a dangerous role, but could I ask you to do that?\r\nMikoto: I know, just leave it to me. Help me out here, Kuroko!\r\nKuroko: I can't say I don't object to you diving into danger, but you've always been one to take action at times like these, Onee-sama.\r\nKuroko: Then, if you'd give me your hand.\r\nMaki: We'll take care of what we need to also.\r\nSanae: I know, there's one thing we have to make sure of. We can't let any of the civilians to get hurt...\r\nMai: Let's eliminate the aradama. Quickly!\r\n\r\nMikoto: Take some of this--!\r\nAradama: Gu... Ggu...!\r\nKuroko: Well done. Then, on to the next.\r\n\r\nKuroko: My positioning could steal one's heart, if I say so myself. Now, Onee-sama--\r\nAradama: Gg... Ggg...!\r\nMikoto: Kuroko, next!\r\n\r\nRuiko: Misaka-san and Shirai-san are incredible out there, but Etou-san, Tsubakuro-san, and Shidou-san are pretty amazing too... ...They're taking out aradama left and right!\r\nKazari: Still, there's some people who haven't evacuated yet... Is there anything we can do to lend a hand?\r\nMii: I think we should try not to get in their way, but I understand how you feel. Should we go ask to see if we can help a little?\r\nKazari: Alright...!\r\nRuiko: There they go. I should go with. What about you, Shokuhou-san?\r\nRuiko: ...Wait, what're you taking out your remote for?\r\nMisaki: Just a little somethingg.\r\nMisaki: I myself plan on getting to safetyy, but, more importantly, won't those two leave you behind if you don't hurry?\r\nRuiko: Ah! Wait up-. Uiharu-, Konori-senpai-.\r\nMisaki: And, beep. With that--\r\nMisaki: (By altering the memories of the people here juuust a little, so that they leave immediately, it should speed up the evacuations, shouldn't it?)\r\nMisaki: Now it's up to Misaka-san to go at it like a workhorse.\r\n\r\nKanami: It looks like they've finished up evacuating, but with more and more aradama coming, can you really keep up with this!?\r\nMikoto: I'll be fine. Though... We need to do something about them.\r\nMai: Looking at the the spectrum finder, the aradama detected in the area... all seem to be gathering around Misaka-san.\r\nKaoru: At this rate, it'll turn out just like that operation we were setting up today.\r\nMikoto: ...Still, we'll just have to go along with it. I don't think we can try taking the them somewhere else at this point. If they're coming to me, we'll use that and finish them all off at once.\r\nKaoru: You're saying you can take care of this many of them!? Seriously...? That's crazy.\r\nMikoto: I have a secret weapon. I'll make sure to aim it off in the sky, so it should be safe.\r\nMikoto: But this could be a little dangerous for all you toji, so stand back.\r\nMikoto: I'm going to put an end to all the mess you're causing. ...This is me at... FULL POWERRRR!!\r\nMai: A-Amazing...\r\nYume: But hey, doesn't it look like they're all turning into one big aradama!?\r\nAradama Roar: GUOOOOOOOOONN!!\r\nMikoto: Ah...\r\nKaoru: Ellen said the metal'd bond together, but I didn't think that meant the aradama would too...\r\nMikoto: Is this going to be okay...?\r\nMaki: It shouldn't be a problem for us. You did a great job. Thanks.\r\nYume: Yeah, yeah. To pay you back for that, I'll let you see what makes me so great now~.\r\nYume: You just sit back and watch, Biribiri-onee-san!\r\nKofuki: I don't get to see aradama-chan like this all that much. Damn... I'm getting goosebumps!\r\nMirja: Heh, it's only at moments like this I can depend on your enthusiasm, Shichinosato Kofuki.\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan gets so lively at times like these, doesn't she?\r\nSanae: If we just handle this like we usually do, it should be fine.\r\nMai: Mmhm. We just need to pool our strength--\r\nKanami: We can do this, everyone! Let's go!\r\n\r\nAfter supressing the aradama--\r\n\r\nMai: We managed to gather lots of that metal, but, will Misaka-san and the others really be able to get home with this?\r\nMikoto: To be honest, I'm not sure. Though, it's not like we'll get anywhere if we don't give it a shot.\r\nEllen: Grandpa said we should aim to get as much of the newly created tamahagane metal that would be needed to make one okatana. We have just enough!\r\nKofuki: Besides, if we just kept on picking up metal, who knows when it'd end.\r\nMisaki: We don't know just how much of this metal came over here with us in the first placee.\r\nRuiko: Now that you mention it, this could be the end of our parallel world lifestyle here, huhh.\r\nKazari: At least be happy that we could get to go back home-.\r\nKazari: Though, I would have liked to have eaten more of the B-grade gourmet Iwakura-san showed me about.\r\nRuiko: So you feel the same, Uiharu-!\r\nRuiko: I wanted to look more into rumors and things unique to this world too. Who gets chances at stuff like this.\r\nYume: Ahaha, you onee-sans are funny!\r\nSanae: It's a shame we can't say we'll do that next time, but I'm glad to hear it got your interest.\r\nMirja: What do we need to do in order to replicate the experiment that will send you home?\r\nMii: When we arrived, Misaka-san sent out a strong electric current, so doesn't it seem possible doing the same thing might have the same effect?\r\nKaoru: If it doesn't work, we can figure something out then.\r\nKanami: And if it does, it might really mean goodbye. Ah, I shouldn't say \"might\", should I.\r\nMikoto: Yeah. We caused you a lot of trouble, but tha--\r\nKuroko: Ahh... Once Onee-sama and I return to our love nest, we can start with a gentle hug and passionate kiss.\r\nKuroko: And then, Onee-sama and I will, ahhhn--!!\r\nMikoto: K-Kuroko! Don't go causing a misunderstanding... saying things like that at a time like this!\r\nKuroko: Calling it a misunderstanding is too too much... And after, ever since we came to this world, I've been refraining from our everyday skinship; you're heartless, Onee-sama! \r\nKuroko: I can't... I can't stand it any longer, Onee-samaaahhn!\r\nMii: In its own way, things are already back to normal.\r\nMikoto: I told you, get off of me!\r\nRuiko: Doesn't this kind of feel like how it was like when we first came here?\r\nMisaki: That's truee. This feels like it really could be goodbye.\r\nKazari: All of you toji should get away, quick! Just to be safe!\r\nMii: Thank you so much, for all the accomodations you gave us.\r\nMikoto: Aghh, come on! I wish I could've given a proper goodbye at least... Thanks for everything. We won't forget about you--\r\nKanami: Stay safe-! Or, they're already gone, huh.\r\nMaki: I wonder if they managed to make it home okay.\r\nYume: There's not much point in asking that, is there? We can't make sure either way.\r\nChie: Tsubakuro-san isn't wrong. But we can at least pray for their safe return.\r\nKaoru: Still, esper powers, huh-. There might be all kinds of worlds out there that we just don't know about.\r\nKanami: Yeah! They really were unbelievable people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: What Do We Need to Do to Get Home?\r\n\r\nKanami: Shidou-san. I brought Mikasa-san and everyone-.\r\nMaki: Thanks. I'll get straight to the point then.\r\nMaki: I'm sure you can all imagine why I've BROUGHT you here. The investigation into this metal found among the noro has made progress.\r\nRuiko: Then, you found something out?\r\nMaki: Kohagura, can I leave the explanation to you?\r\nEllen: Understood! Nice to meet you, I'm Kohagura Ellen. Let's all get along, okay!\r\nRuiko: Wow-, check it out, Uiharu. She's huge.\r\nKazari: You know you shouldn't do that... Even if you're thinking it, don't say it.\r\nMai: Ellen-chan is the granddaughter of Dr. Friedman, the man investigating this metal, and she got us in touch with their research institute.\r\nEllen: First, I'll share what we've learned.\r\nEllen: According to Grandpa and the Special Rare Metals Utilization Research Institute, although this metal is being found in the noro, it did not exist in our world beforehand.\r\nEllen: Although it's similar in composition to Tamahagane, it is a different metal. Even with the same volume, it's slightly lighter, for example.\r\nMikoto: If it's a different metal, then that means it did come with us from our world...?\r\nEllen: I think there's a good chance of that.\r\nEllen: Of course, it's also possible that it was created at the point you all arrived here, for some still unknown reason.\r\nMii: It seems clear that the tamahagane created from the experiment Misaka-san helped with is something brand new.\r\nKuroko: Though, that much won't help us find a means of going back to our own world.\r\nKaoru: Oi, Ellen. How about you tell them the theory you were talking about before?\r\nEllen: I guess I should. This isn't confirmed yet, but we have a hypothesis about our world, your world, and what caused them to be linked together.\r\nEllen: According to Grandpa, this metal, which closely resembles tamahagane, may have been a catalyst for going through the netherworld to here.\r\nMikoto: So, if we came here through the netherworld, how would we go about getting back home?\r\nEllen: If we assume that the tamahagane you tried to create also exists in your original world, if we try to form the same tamahagane here, then--\r\nKazari: You mean, the same thing that happened when we came here might happen again?\r\nEllen: We're only talking hypothetically, but that's exactly right! And, for that reason, we'll need to gather as much of that generated metal as we possibly can.\r\nKanami: So then, when we're on missions, there might be aradama with that metal inside them, so we need to watch out.\r\nMai: Yep! From the aradama we've defeated in the past few days, there seems to be lots of cases of finding noro containing that metal, though only in small amounts.\r\nKanami: We'll get up a whole bunch of it so you can go home, so just wait a little while longer.\r\nMikoto: Thank you.\r\nMikoto: But, let us do what we can too. We might not be able to defeat aradama, but I think we can help. It seems like we're the cause of this, after all.\r\nKanami: With your electric shocks, and depending on how we use Shirai-san's teleportation, it might be effective in fighting aradama?\r\nKuroko: If that's what Onee-sama plans on doing, I, Kuroko, will offer you toji my assistance.\r\nMikoto: Shidou-san. Will you allow us to help you eliminate the aradama?\r\nMaki: I'd honestly like to refuse you here, but, alright. Only on the condition that you never put yourselves at risk. Fighting the aradama is our duty.\r\nMikoto: Understood, thank you very much! Alright-, let's go!\r\nKanami: Let's give it our all, Misaka-san!\r\nMisaki: Do your best, everyone~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/JHZISRWAzhM\r\n[Railgun - Kanami: Start]: The Mysterious Use of the Remote\r\n\r\nOne day, Kanami was having tea with Mikoto and the rest.\r\n\r\nKanami: Are you used to living here yet?\r\nKuroko: Yes, entirely. Though, the one thing I'm still not used to is sleeping apart from Onee-sama.\r\nMai: You two sure are close, aren't you. Misaka-san and Shirai-san.\r\nMikoto: Just so you don't get the wrong idea, we only sleep in the same dorm room together... It's not like we sleep in the same bed.\r\nKanami: It's okay, we get it.\r\nMikoto: And also, I'm used to living here too. You do a lot for us. And just having to shoot aradama with electricity is easy for me.\r\nKanami: I'm glad to hear it. What about you, Shokuhou-san? Is anything bothering you?\r\nMisaki: I'm doing just fine too. It's pretty fresh, this lifestyle over heree.\r\n--[clatter]\r\nKanami: Shokuhou-san, you dropped something just now. ...Is this a remote?\r\nMisaki: Thank youu, Etou-san.\r\nKanami: Why are you carrying a remote around with you?\r\nMisaki: Hmm, why exactlyy? Why do you think that is, Etou-san?\r\nKanami: If you ask me, I think you can leave a remote in whichever room it belongs.\r\nKanami: Maybe if you have to lend a remote to somebody, but I've never had to. What about you, Mai?\r\nMai: There was one time Kanami-chan has said she couldn't find her remote, so I brought mine over to her room, but I think that's about it?\r\nKanami: Ahaha... My room was a real mess then.\r\nKanami: Ah, I know! You didn't have a remote, and, when you were on your way home from buying one, you went to see Misaka-san's experiment!\r\nMisaki: If that were the case, would you just happen to be carrying one with you?\r\nMai: Thinking about it normally, I can't imagine why you'd carry one around, so does it have something to do with your power after all, Shokuhou-san?\r\nMisaki: Well, maybee.\r\nMisaki: I haven't felt like using my power in this world, but, by force of habit, I end up bringing it with mee.\r\nYume: I really wanna know what kind of power you're hiding-!\r\nMisaki: Then, how about you try guessing what it is? If you get it right, I'll let you knoww. But, each person only gets one guess.\r\nMisaki: And, Misaka-san, Shirai-san, giving them hints is off limits, understood?\r\nMikoto: I get it.\r\nKuroko: This is another form of recreation. I wouldn't do something so rude.\r\nKanami: So you two really do know after all.\r\nKuroko: Anyone in Academy City, whether or not they were aware of the full details, would have heard of just what power a level 5 like Shokuhou Misaki has.\r\nKanami: I guess that makes sense, since she has a strong power. But still, what kind of power could it be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Railgun - Kanami: End]: It Could Be That Kind of Power!\r\n\r\nYume: A power that uses a TV remote, huh-.\r\nKanami: Remotes turn things on and off and can change the channels, but does that have anything to do with it?\r\nYume: Hmm~...\r\nYume: Ah, I got it! It's a power to make machines do whatever you want!\r\nMisaki: Bzzt-. Tsubakuro-san, that's wrongg.\r\nYume: Ehh-, but I was sure that was it-!\r\nMai: I was thinking something like that too, but I guess not. Then, is it a power that can send a sort of message to people far away? Like telepathy.\r\nMisaki: You were closee, but Yanase-san got it wrong too.\r\nMai: I thought it might send some sort of signal, but it's hard to narrow down, isn't it.\r\nMisaki: You're the only one left, Etou-san.\r\nMai: Give it your best shot, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: My answer is, simply-- A beam!\r\nYume: Huh?\r\nMai: Kanami-chan?\r\nMikoto: ...A beam? What made you think that??\r\nKanami: I was thinking, instead of a signal coming out the end of the remote to turn things off and on, it could shoot out a beam like, \"Bibibibi-!\"\r\nKanami: Kind of like, like this!\r\n\r\nMisaki: Fufufu, Etou-san. Now that you've learned the secret of my power, I won't be letting you off so easy~.\r\nMisaki: Take thiis, bibibibibibi-!\r\nKanami: Wahh! Save me, Shirai-san!\r\nKuroko: This way! Etou-san!\r\nMisaki: I can shoot a beam with lots of different effects, so you can't escape my beams~.\r\nMisaki: Take this, and that! Ahahahaha!\r\n\r\nKanami: And basically, Shokuhou-san's power is to control a beam that changes depending on the buttons she pushes!\r\nYume: Kanami-onee-san, that whole thing you acted out... What was that?\r\nKuroko: And also, why did I appear in this fantasy of yours?\r\nKanami: I mean, it just felt right for a battle between people with superpowers, so it popped in my head. Anyway, did I get it right?\r\nMisaki: Nope, my power isn't like that.\r\nMisaki: If I did have a beamm, I'd have helped you defeat the aradama a little.\r\nKanami: I guess that's true.\r\nMikoto: You think? If you had a power like that, even if you tried to help out, you'd be so out of shape you'd just slow us down for sure.\r\nMisaki: Sighh... Why don't we ignore Misaka-san, who cant go through a tiny hypothetical without showing her powers of rudeness, and have some more tea?\r\nKanami: More tea sounds good, but let's have it with Misaka-san too!\r\nMisaki: If we mustt. As a prize just for trying, I'll allow Misaka-san to join us.\r\nMikoto: Don't treat me like a consolation prize just because I was right.\r\nMai: Do these two maybe get along after all...\r\nKanami: That's what it seems like.\r\nKanami: But still, what's that remote for anyway?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/UMDuFWf-sOc\r\n[Railgun - Chie: Start]: Sightseeing Kamakura with Onee-san\r\n\r\nRuiko: I was thinking this seeing it up close, but, doesn't the Great Buddha of Kamakura seem kind of hunched over?\r\nChie: Now that you mention it, it is, isn't it. Maybe it's to make it easier for visitors to see his face?\r\nKazari: Ah, that sounds like it could be the reason why.\r\nKazari: What should we do next? There were other places I wanted to go see, but it's probably going to get dark soon.\r\nRuiko: Still, isn't it a little early to be heading back?\r\nChie: That's right, in that case, why don't we go get something sweet to eat? There's a place I want to visit.\r\nRuiko: I'm all for it!\r\nKazari: I can't wait!\r\n\r\nRuiko: Ahh-, that shiruko was so good. They went all out with the azuki beans. I'm a fan now!\r\nChie: The mochi was just the right size too, so it felt fine eating before dinner.\r\nKazari: The cream anmitsu was delicious too. If only Misaka-san and everyone were here to taste it.\r\nRuiko: Right-? I get the feeling they've been working a little too hard.\r\nChie: That's true. Let's buy something to bring back as a present for them.\r\nKazari: Sure! Setouchi-san, thank you very much for taking us sightseeing around Kamakura today.\r\nChie: You're very welcome. I'd never taken a good look at the sights here myself, so it was fun.\r\nRuiko: On top of that, you treated us to oden at that shop just now. Thanks a lot!\r\nChie: Fufu, it was nothing. Don't mention it.\r\nRuiko: The croquettes we tried on the way were tasty too; I'm really glad you came with us, Setouchi-san!\r\nChie: Sanae-chan is the one who told me, if you're going into Kamakura, you have to stop by that croquette shop.\r\nKazari: I see. So that was one of Iwakura-san's picks.\r\nRuiko: We'll have to tell her thanks later then. Anyway, to finish off our sightseeing, let's pick out some souvenirs!\r\nRuiko: What would be good-? It's gotta be something for everyone to eat, right? Since there's a lot of people, we should buy a variety of stuff.\r\nRuiko: It would've been great if we had gotten some of that shiruko from before as a present.\r\nKazari: I want to get some Kamakura Great Buddha candy and something else. Come to think of it, we've been eating different things all day, haven't we?\r\nChie: Isn't that fine? Savoring tasty foods is one of the goals of sightseeing.\r\nChie: But the shops might be closing up for the day soon, so we should hurry.\r\nRuiko/Kazari: Okaaay~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Railgun - Chie: End]: Lets Make Lovely Flower Decorations with Onee-san\r\n\r\nRuiko: I want to do something to thank her, you know? Not just for taking us around Kamakura yesterday, but for everything Setouchi-san's been doing for us.\r\nKazari: Me too. Though, I can't come up with any good ideas.\r\nChie: Ah, do you two have some spare time right now? There's something I'd like your help with.\r\nRuiko: Sure thing, whatever we can do to help! Right, Uiharu?\r\nKazari: Right! Whatever you need us for!\r\nChie: Fufu, thank you. Could you come with me for a minute?\r\n\r\nRuiko: Where are we going? Are we leaving the school?\r\nChie: No, it's only just in the courtyard there. There were some pretty flowers in bloom, so I wanted to stop by.\r\nKazari: Hmm. I'm a little curious in seeing what kind of flowers they have now.\r\nRuiko: ......\r\n\r\nRuiko: I was wondering what you needed our help with, but we're making a wreath of flowers for some reason!?\r\nKazari: Don't fool around, Saten-san. Let's make this properly.\r\nRuiko: You say that, but-. It's pretty hard working with flowers.\r\nKazari: You're great with sewing, so if you just do it carefully, you should be fine.\r\nRuiko: Fine, I'll get a little serious I guess-.\r\nKazari: Ah, Setouchi-san. What do you think of using this next?\r\nChie: Oh, that would be great. This is turning into a fine flower wreath with all the nice ones you're picking out, Uiharu-san.\r\nKazari: Do you think so? I'm just choosing the ones that catch my eye.\r\nChie: I really like this wreath we've made together.\r\nKazari: Ehehe... I'm happy to hear you think that.\r\nRuiko: Still, why are we making a wreath of flowers all of a sudden?\r\nChie: Uiharu-san's wreath is so adorable that I sort of felt like making one.\r\nKazari: ...?\r\nRuiko: Ah-, so that's what this is about.\r\nChie: And, I thought I'd give this wreath as a gift. The one we're making now, I think it would look perfect on you, Uiharu-san. The color combination, and the types of flowers we used.\r\nChie: I'd be happy if you're happy with that.\r\nKazari: ......\r\nRuiko: ...U-Uiharu?\r\nKazari: Um... Thank you very much. I can't let your kindness go to waste. I'll treasure it.\r\nRuiko: That's great-... I was worried for a minute there.\r\nKazari: ? What are you talking about, Saten-san.\r\nRuiko: Ehh-...\r\nChie: Now then, how about we make another one for Saten-san~.\r\nKazari: Sure~."}, {"paste_key": "x9d6yMvZ", "title": "Rumored Urban Legend Watching", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/x9d6yMvZ", "timestamp": "", "hits": "89", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/2M6zbLwwmAo\r\n\r\n1: Aradama and a Strange Rumor\r\n\r\nRuiko: Every time aradama suddenly show up, I'm hit with the feeling of, we really did get reincarnated in another world, you know?\r\nKofuki: Wouldn't you guys have to die first to get reincarnated here?\r\nRuiko: I mean, you're not wrong, but isn't it easier to understand that way? It sums up what's happening.\r\nMii: I do understand what you're getting at though.\r\nMaki: By the way, Konori. Is there anything we can do to make things more comfortable for you here?\r\nMii: No, we're fine right now. Thanks for asking. You've done so much for us. It's been a huge help.\r\nChie: We want to look out for you too, but there might be things we've missed. So, not only you, Konori-san, but if any of you need anything, feel free to ask.\r\nYume: Biribiri-onee-san. Show me how you make it all crackly again.\r\nMikoto: Biribiri-onee-san, huh...\r\nMikoto: Well, it beats being called just \"Biribiri\" at least.\r\nMikoto: Since we're indoors, I'm only going to do it a little.\r\nKanami: Isn't it kinda cool how she can manipulate electricity like that?\r\nSanae: While we're on the topic Misaka-san can shoot electricity. Shirai-san can teleport. What kind of powers do the rest of you have?\r\nKaoru: Those kind of powers are pretty exciting, after all. You can't help but want to see more-.\r\nMii: My power is clairvoyance. Let's see; I could tell you what kind of cakes are inside that box.\r\nMii: A strawberry shortcake, a cheesecake, a Mont Blanc, and a Pudding a la Mode. They each look delicious.\r\nMai: Wow... That's amazing, you got them all right.\r\nKanami: You're all so crazy. What kind of powers do Uiharu-san and Saten-san have?\r\nKazari: When you look at me so expectantly, I can't help but feel like you'll be disappointed... I have the power to keep whatever I touch at a fixed temperature.\r\nKazari: Its name is \"Thermal Hand\", but since I'm just a level 1, I can't do anything significant with it.\r\nRuiko: Uiharu-. When you put it that way, it makes it hard for a level 0 like me to speak up.\r\nRuiko: Mine's \"Aero Hand\", but since my level's too low, the effects of it are too weak to even see-. Sorry about that.\r\nMirja: No, there's nothing you need to apologize for, Saten Ruiko. It's very interesting being able to learn about the Academy City you come from.\r\nKaoru: They seriously are from out of this world.\r\nTsugumi: I'm slightly curious about one point. Level 1, level 0; are they divided based on the power, range, duration, and so on?\r\nKuroko: In general, it's fine to assume as much.\r\nKuroko: There exist levels 0 through 5. And, up at the top, among the many espers, there are only seven level 5s. And, one of those seven is Misaka Mikoto-onee-sama herself!\r\nYume: Huh, so Biribiri-onee-san's one. Is she that great?\r\nMikoto: ...Hey, Kuroko! Do you have to praise me up even after coming to another world? And besides, Shokuhou's a level 5 too.\r\nKuroko: I only ensured that everyone had a more proper image of you.\r\nKanami: What kind of power do you have, Shokuhou-san?\r\nMisaki: My power isss--\r\nMisaki: A secret~. It's not the kind of ability that's any fun to show off, you know?\r\nKanami: It isn't...? That's too bad.\r\nKaoru: Well, everybody's got their own circumstances.\r\nMikoto: ...Can we talk for a minute?\r\nMisaki: What abouut? I don't have that much time to spend chatting with you.\r\nMikoto: Under no circumstances are you going to alter these people's memories or anything, right?\r\nMisaki: Sigh... Now why would I go and do that? There's no merit in it for me.\r\nMikoto: That's fine then.\r\nRuiko: When you toji are fighting aradama, you can jump around really far. Is that some kind of special power?\r\nMaki: We can enhance our strength like that, using our okatana as a medium.\r\nMii: Then, is the reason aradama's attacks don't hurt you also because of your okatana?\r\nMaki: That's right. It can temporarily raise our body's endurance.\r\nChie: As far as defense goes, there's also one more aspect to it. We can apply something called \"utsushi\".\r\nChie: It's a technique that converts our bodies to something of a state of pure energy.\r\nChie: With utsushi applied, even if we were fatally injured, when utsushi is removed, the injury is gone as well.\r\nChie: There's still some mental damage left over though.\r\nKazari: It's like a kind of barrier, or like a body replacement technique, isn't it!\r\nKaoru: Sure, let's go with that.\r\nMikoto: From hearing about them, your toji powers... Aren't your skills pretty incredible too?\r\nMii: They might have been developed to combat aradama, but some are awe-inspiring to see.\r\nYume: You think so-? Isn't it way cooler if each and everybody has their own power?\r\nMaki: I think we'd both feel that way about the things we're less used to.\r\nMaki: As far as I can tell, there aren't any major issues with you living here, but I hope we can find a method of getting you back home soon.\r\nMaki: We're doing all we can to collect that metal that we sometimes find mixed in with the noro, but we haven't gotten very far. All we can do is wait for more news from the investigation.\r\nRuiko: That reminds me...\r\nRuiko: I don't think this has anything to do with the aradama with that metal from Misaka-san's experiment, but I did hear a sorta interesting rumor about an aradama.\r\nKazari: You really can't stop thinking about rumors and urban legends, can you, Saten-san.\r\nKuroko: I can't believe you would keep that up even after coming to this world. Could I ask you not to stick your neck into trouble?\r\nRuiko: I just got curious if there were any urban legends unique to here, so I asked around a little.\r\nTsugumi: If you've heard an interesting rumor regarding aradama, I'd be interested in knowing more too-. I do research into aradama.\r\nTsugumi: What was this urban legend about?\r\nRuiko: I heard that, even though aradama look like scary monsters, there's an aradama that's small and cute too...!\r\nRuiko: Though, the toji who told me about it hadn't actually seen it herself.\r\nRuiko: But still, don't you just want to get to the bottom of this!? Is it some kind of mutant? Was it made by some mad scientist's experiment ...My imagination's running wild here!\r\nKazari: That's a bad habit of yours, Saten-san.\r\nTsugumi: Hmm hmm. You're right, that is fascinating. I'd like to know the truth behind it-.\r\nMai: Umm, isn't that...\r\nKaoru: ......\r\nKanami: ...!\r\nTsugumi: Though, I am busy, so I won't be able to chase down this mystery. How bothersome-.\r\nRuiko: In that case, I'll get to the bottom of this one for sure! It's not like I've got anything better to do anyway!\r\nTsugumi: I'll look forward to it then. Ah, but please, don't go doing anything dangerous.\r\nRuiko: I got it-. Uiharu, starting tomorrow, we've got an important mission to hunt down the truth of an urban legend!\r\nKazari: Ehh-- I'm a part of this too-!?\r\nKanami: When we have the time, we'll join you! You'd be in trouble if you actually ran into an aradama.\r\nRuiko: Thanks so much! Whenever you're free, just come on board!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Chasing Urban Legends\r\n\r\nRuiko: Thanks for everything-.\r\nRuiko: Hmm, none of the info I'm getting sounds all that convincing. Though, getting clues bit by bit is the real fun of urban legends!\r\nKuroko: Everyone we've asked about about a small cute aradama has given us blank stares or looks of confusion.\r\nMirja: Aradama are inherently something to be feared. Reactions like those are only natural.\r\nMikoto: They go on rampages and attack people after all. Are you sure this urban legend isn't just completely made up?\r\nRuiko: You don't get it, Misaka-san. Even the fact that it might be made up is what makes hunting down the truth so romantic.\r\nSanae: You really do love this sort of thing, don't you, Saten-san.\r\nRuiko: More than loving it, it's like it just gets stuck in my head, I guess?\r\nKazari: And, in the end, we all wound up going along with Saten-san's search for urban legends.\r\nMii: It's fine, it's fine. I don't have anything else to take care of here either.\r\nMikoto: Actually, it's strange seeing you of all people coming along. What brought this on?\r\nMisaki: If I were the only one off on my own, the toji would get overly fussy about me, wouldn't they? So. That's. All.\r\nMikoto: (She has a point there, but the way she said it is annoying...)\r\nRuiko: Thanks for coming along too, Iwakura-san, Kitora-san.\r\nSanae: So long as we don't get any emergency calls, we should be fine for today.\r\nKanami: Saten-saaan. I brought Yume-chan along to pitch in-.\r\nYume: I don't really care about a tiny aradama, but you onee-sans looked like you're having fun.\r\nMii: This has turned into a fairly bustling group, hasn't it.\r\nMirja: Then, what should we do next? It might be a good idea to split into two parties.\r\n\r\nKazari: We looked into that big discount store just now, but you don't seem have any cans of strawberry oden or strawberry monjayaki in this world...\r\nKanami: We have a few differences, like this side has aradama and your side has special powers, but things are basically the same... So I thought, \"Maybe they'll have it!\" But, no luck...\r\nRuiko: I thought it'd be good to split up for a bit, but Uiharu, that's what you were looking for!?\r\nKanami: We were just a little morbidly curious. I wanted to know what it'd taste like.\r\nSanae: Yeah. Uiharu-san said we just had to try it. I thought it might be tasty...\r\nYume: Mmm, I like strawberry daifuku and stuff a lot, but oden is going too far...\r\nKazari: It has a highly refined flavor, you know? You can't judge it from appearances alone.\r\nRuiko: No way, it's pretty much what you'd expect!\r\nMisaki: Might if I say somethingg?\r\nRuiko: Don't tell me, Shokuhou-san's a fan of strawberry oden too!?\r\nMisaki: What are you talking about? I mean about the aradama we're searching for, of coursee.\r\nRuiko: Did you come across something important?\r\nMisaki: If there were a cute aradama out there, wouldn't it be possible lots of people might not even recognize it as an aradamaa?\r\nMii: Now that you mention it...\r\nMirja: You've honed in on an interesting point, Shokuhou Misaki.\r\nMikoto: So basically, there could be some kind cute small animal you wouldn't be able to tell was an aradama!\r\nMisaki: Wasn't that the rumor from the start? Why do you look so happy noww?\r\nKuroko: It is Onee-sama after all... She's surely picturing some sort of fancy aradama moving about, with an indescribable sense of excitement... What will I ever do with her.\r\nMikoto: I-I'm not getting excited...  Can you not go making it sound weird?\r\nMikoto: I was only thinking, maybe there's a cute frog looking aradama, okay!\r\nYume: Hmm, you like cute things, Biribiri-onee-san?\r\nMikoto: ...Well, I do, a little.\r\nYume: Then, do you like stuff like this?\r\nMikoto: Ooh... Hey, this is cute... Are these special mascots they only sell in this world?\r\nYume: This one's called Ichigo Daifuku Neko. It's my favorite.\r\nMikoto: Then, I'll do you one better...\r\nMikoto: Here's my Gekota strap!\r\nYume: Ahh-. So that's why you were talking about a cute frog looking aradama.\r\nMikoto: Yep. Isn't it cute!\r\nRuiko: Sorry to bust in when you're getting all worked up over your favorite mascots, but... Could we get moving soon?\r\nMikoto: Y-Yeah, sure. Let's go... Ahaha.\r\n\r\nKazari: At any rate, we can search tomorrow for any information on sightings of strange small cute creatures.\r\nSanae: I think it's a good idea to follow that line of thinking.\r\nKanami: (It looks like this'll go fine without us having to do anything unnecessary to help them along. The rest just depends on Kaoru-chan's missions.)\r\nRuiko: Let's go at it hard again tomorrow!\r\n\r\nThe next day--\r\n\r\nMii: Just from asking around, it seems like there have been sightings of a small unknown creature in the area.\r\nKuroko: On top of that, a toji was sometimes seen bringing it around. What's going on here?\r\nChie: ...Th-That sure is strange.\r\nRuiko: A toji together with the aradama they're supposed to beat! That sounds kinda sorta cool, doesn't it?\r\nRuiko: They say mysteries invite mysteries, but that kind of combo really heats this up.\r\nKazari: If those are the conditions, then, instead of asking people about town, I think it'd be faster if we started asking toji.\r\nRuiko: Let's head back to Renpu Girls' Academy! Since we're getting close to the truth, I want to give a heads up to Shokuhou-san too.\r\nMai: Mmhm... I think that should work fine too.\r\nMai: Umm, Chie-san and I have something to take care of, so we'll catch up with you later.\r\nChie: That's right. If you go from here to Renpu, you shouldn't be in danger of getting attacked by any aradama either.\r\nMikoto: Thanks for coming along with us, you two.\r\nMikoto: Anyway, we'll see you later!\r\nMai: Phew... I think they're having a good time, but I feel kind of bad.\r\nChie: I know... We're conspiring with Kaoru-san and the others on the side.\r\n\r\nMisaki: ...Even so, it's not as if you had to come all the way to get me.\r\nRuiko: Come on, we're right at the end. From asking around campus, people said they just saw it here!\r\nKazari: But, would there really be an aradama at a toji school?\r\nMii: And also... They said that a petite toji had a strange small animal riding on her head... It's quite the report.\r\nKuroko: Then, an eyewitness also said they were headed toward the entranceway. For an urban legend... It's too specific in many ways.\r\nRuiko: You've got to pin down the truth even with weird things like that, Shirai-san.\r\nMikoto: We've come this far, haven't we.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: A Playful Heart and the Rumor's Truth\r\n\r\nRuiko: Ah! Mashiko-san!\r\nRuiko: That strange thing riding on your head... Is that it!\r\nKaoru: So you made it to the truth, huh. That was faster than I was expecting.\r\nNene: Nenene-!\r\nMii: The toji who got along with the aradama was you, wasn't it, Mashiko-san.\r\nKaoru: This little guy's the guardian beast of the Mashiko family. We've been together since I was a kid.\r\nRuiko: Then, that means Etou-san and Yanase-san and everyone must've known, right? You're close and all.\r\nMai: Sorry for keeping quiet about it.\r\nKaoru: But hey, it'd feel rude just handing the answer to somebody who's set on chasing it down.\r\nMikoto: Saten-san was so excited to find the truth at that point, wasn't she?\r\nRuiko: Well, sure-. As soon as I hear about an urban legend, I can't help it. I get caught up in this feeling, like, \"Let's do this-\".\r\nKanami: We wanted to let you have some fun. So, we played along a little, alright?\r\nKanami: We knew the truth behind the rumor wasn't going to be anything dangerous either.\r\nTsugumi: I was the first to spur you on. I was telling the truth when I said I was interested in the aradama of the Mashiko family, but I'm sorry to instigate you like that.\r\nRuiko: Nah, you don't have to worry about it. It was a lot of fun.\r\nRuiko: And, if you'd just told me the truth straight away, I don't think I would have felt that excitement of getting to the bottom of this.\r\nMisaki: I only went along with you for a little, but it wasn't such a bad way of killing time, was it?\r\nRuiko: For sure. I got to experience all sorts of things while we were investigating too.\r\nKaoru: That's all we wanted to hear. Right?\r\nNene: Ne~~.\r\nMikoto: It doesn't look like how I pictured it, but... This is cute too... I want touch it.\r\nKaoruko: In a sense, your reaction was just as I pictured, Onee-sama...\r\nKazari: What's this little guy's name?\r\nKaoru: It's Nene.\r\nMirja: Cases of aradama such as Nene are exceptionally rare, so I'd say none outside of Mashiko Kaoru's acquaintances would believe it. In actuality, Nene has in part become a rumor.\r\nRuiko: This guy sure is nothing at all like the aradama we've seen so far. Let me pet him.\r\nRuiko: --Eh, he jumped!?\r\nMii: KYA. Th-That took me by surprise. It's a good thing I caught him at least.\r\nNene: Ne~!\r\nKuroko: This is... He seems to be somehow attached to you, Konori-senpai.\r\nMikoto: You're so lucky, Konori-senpai...\r\nMii: I'm not quite sure why that is myself.\r\nMikoto: C-Can I try hugging him too? Nene-cha...\r\nNene: Nene~!\r\nMisaki: Honestly, what's with this little guyy... Head on over to Misaka-san already.\r\nKaoru: Well-, that's just how he is.\r\nChie: I thought things might turn out this way, when Nene-chan came in touch with Konori-san and Shokuhou-san...\r\nMai: Ahaha...\r\nRuiko: Ah-. Does that mean, Nene-chan's...\r\nMisaki: Basicallyy, does that mean he's more attached to girls with bigger bust power? How unfortunate for youu, Misaka-san.\r\nMikoto: ...!?!?\r\nKuroko: Now, now. Onee-sama, you still have me as your partner in skinship. Please love and caress me to your heart's desire.\r\nKazari: Ahaha... It might cause other problems, but it'd be nice if the other aradama could all be as friendly as Nene-chan here.\r\nRuiko: Yeah. I think it'd be best if they got along like Mashiko-san and Nene-chan here.\r\nMai: That's for sure.\r\nKaoru: Hopefully things could end up like that someday.\r\nMii: By the way, is there any way of getting along better with Nene-chan?\r\nRuiko: I wanna know!\r\nKaoru: Fine, I guess we can try some things out-. It's not like he doesn't like you or anything, Mikoto.\r\nMikoto: !\r\nKaoru: Nene, c'mere for a sec.\r\nNene: Nene~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Qn8sW115TSU\r\n[Railgun - Kofuki: Start]: It's Bizarre! The Human Aradama of Renpu Girls' Academy!\r\n\r\nRuiko: Shichinosato-san! Is it really true that Renpu Girls' Academy is researching human aradamas behind closed doors!?\r\nKofuki: The hell are you talking about?\r\nRuiko: It's a rumor I've been hearing from all the toji!\r\nRuiko: Since I like learning about urban legends, I thought you toji might have some, so I asked a bunch of people!\r\nKazari: I'm sorry about her, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: Then, why'd you decide to ask me about this? I don't really care about rumors and whatever, y'know?\r\nRuiko: Even if you aren't interested, you're still a toji at Renpu Girls' Academy, right? And also, I've heard you hang around the research labs a lot.\r\nKofuki: Well, you're not wrong, but still, human aradama...\r\nRuiko: It's exciting!\r\nKofuki: Like I'd know anything.\r\nRuiko: What, so it was only a rumor after all-?\r\nKazari: See, that's what I was telling you. There's no way that kind of thing would be real!\r\nRuiko: You say that, but, if it really was real, wouldn't you be interested, Uiharu?\r\nKazari: In that case... I think I would, a little...\r\nKofuki: Then, wanna go see the research labs? I was just about to head over there actually.\r\nRuiko: Can we!?\r\nKofuki: Sure, do whatever you want. Though, whatever happens when you get there, it's not my problem.\r\nRuiko: W-Whatever happens...? Then, are there really human aradama!?\r\nKazari: S-Saten-san, maybe we should just give up on this...\r\nRuiko: It sounds interesting! Let's go, Uiharu!\r\nKazari: Of course it came to this...\r\n\r\nRuiko: ...Gulp. This is the lab from the rumors... Shichinosato-san... Wait, huh? She's not here?\r\nKazari: She was right with us until a minute ago... Wh-Where'd she go?\r\nRuiko: ...Maybe the toilet?\r\nKazari: Do you think?\r\n???: Excuse me.\r\nRuiko/Kazari: HYAAAAAAAA!?\r\nRuiko: I'm sorry, it's not like we wandered in here on our own! Shichinosato-san just led us here is all!\r\nKazari: This is why I told you to stop, didn't I!\r\nTsugumi: Really now... This was mean of you, Shichinosato-san.\r\nRuiko/Kazari: Huh?\r\nKofuki: Ahahahahaha! Sorry, sorry.\r\nTsugumi: Honestly... My name is Ban Tsugumi. You wanted to look in on our research, didn't you? Make yourselves at home.\r\nRuiko: I-I thought you'd be mad at us...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Railgun - Kofuki: End]: Take it Easy With Gathering Rumors\r\n\r\nRuiko: When you suddenly popped out at us, I was thinking, \"We're gonna get turned into human aradama experiments!\"\r\nTsugumi: Human aradama... Ahh, it's about that rumor, isn't it.\r\nRuiko: You know about it!?\r\nKazari: Saten-san, let's stop asking them weird questions.\r\nSaten: But, we finally met someone who knows about it!? Aren't you curious, Uiharu?\r\nKazari: Well, I am a little bit curious...\r\nTsugumi: That rumor is completely made up. We don't carry out experiments fusing humans with aradama or the like here.\r\nRuiko: So that's all-.\r\nKazari: Then, what kind of research do you do here?\r\nTsugumi: We gather data on aradama and toji. To put it simply, we have toji fight with aradama, and we collect the resulting data.\r\nRuiko: Kind of like that?\r\nKofuki: ORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nTsugumi: Yes, just like that.\r\nRuiko: Is it alright for us to watch on for a while?\r\nTsugumi: It's perfectly fine. Just, hold on...\r\nKofuki: Alright, I'm done!\r\nRuiko: Hey, it looks like she just finished beating the aradama too, so let's go!\r\nTsugumi: Ah, please wait a moment!\r\nTsugumi: Uiharu-san, please stop Saten-san! The current turn hasn't finished yet!\r\nKazari: Ehh!? S-Saten-san, hang on!\r\n\r\nRuiko: Huh?\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nKofuki: Hey, what'd you come running in here for!!\r\nRuiko: I-I thought you were finished already!\r\nKazari: Are you okay, Saten-san!?\r\nKofuki: You two aren't supposed to be in here! Whatever! I'll take care of these guys fast, so just hide in the back!\r\nRuiko/Kazari: O-Okay!\r\n\r\nRuiko: Th-Thank god we're safe...\r\nKazari: This is all because you didn't listen to Ban-san finish talking.\r\nRuiko: ...Sorry about that.\r\nKofuki: Take it easy with chasing these weird rumors, will you.\r\nRuiko: Right, I'll be more careful about it from now on!\r\nTsugumi: ...I notice you didn't say you were going to stop."}, {"paste_key": "Ac0PkHaG", "title": "4-8 The Changing World", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/Ac0PkHaG", "timestamp": "", "hits": "147", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/gDDa4lpWeQo\r\n\r\n1: To Where You Need to Return (1)\r\n\r\nMinato: So, you're Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: I am.\r\nMinato: You're just like what I heard.\r\nHiyori: What were you telling her, Kanami?\r\nKanami: N-Nothing special.\r\nMinato: Fufu, you're totally like Kagari.\r\nKagari: Kanami-san resembles you as well, Minato-senpai.\r\nMinato: Ehh~, we're nothing alike. Kanami's the cute type, while I'm the sexy type.\r\nKanami: Are you actually the sexy type...?\r\nMinato: What else am I then!?\r\nKagari: The ill-mannered type.\r\nMinato: KAGARIII! Geez, you haven't changed at all!\r\nMinato: But anyway, both of us managed to have such cute daughters, huh. Isn't that great? ...Kagari.\r\nKagari: It is.\r\nMinato: Go on, Kagari. Call her by her name.\r\nKagari: Alright.\r\nKagari: ...Hiyori...san.\r\nMinato: She's your daughter! You don't need the \"san\".\r\nKagari: ...H-Hiyori.\r\nHiyori: Ahh...\r\nMinato: Alright, you too, Hiyori-chan. Call her \"Mom.\"\r\nKanami: Ehh-, but you always hate it when I call you that~.\r\nMinato: It's fine right now!\r\nHiyori: ......Mom...\r\nKagari: Hiyori.\r\nHiyori: What's that?\r\nKagari: Perhaps this small gap drifting in the netherworld is being swallowed into its depths.\r\nKanami: Mother, I'm glad I got to be with you at the end.\r\nMinato: What're you talking about? You two are going home.\r\nKanami: Huh? Wait, how are we supposed to go home?\r\nMinato: How... Well, I don't know that much.\r\nKanami: Ehhh~~~!?\r\nHiyori: I thought anyone who went to the depths of the netherworld wouldn't be able to return?\r\nMinato: And who said that?\r\nKagari: There's no precedent for anyone ever returning.\r\nMinato: Really?\r\nKagari: Though, since you two still have your bodies, you might be able to.\r\nKagari: In order to do that--\r\n\r\nMinato: We're gonna have to do this after all!\r\nKanami: Why did it come to this anyway?\r\nKagari: It's best to break off any lingering attachments you have left. They might prevent you from returning.\r\nKanami: Lingering attachments...?\r\nMinato: You say that, but Kanami just wanted to fight me so bad she couldn't sit still, am I right?\r\nKanami: Ehehe, so you could tell after all.\r\nMinato: A mother can tell it all.\r\nKanami: Here I come!\r\nMinato: Bring it on!\r\nKanami: You really are tough...

Are you happy now?\r\nHiyori: ...I am. Because, when it was difficult, I had someone special to help carry my burden... I have all these friends.\r\nKagari: I see... Then, I don't regret anything.\r\nHiyori: Alright!\r\n\r\nMinato: Oww... I went and lost...\r\nKagari: Even Minato-senpai can be surprisingly helpless at times. That inconsistency is the nature of Minato-senpai's swordsmanship.\r\nMinato: Ahaha. That's why I couldn't win at the tournament either~.\r\nKanami: But, you've beaten me so many times...\r\nMinato: Hup. Yep, that's just how it is.\r\nKanami: And that means, Kanami, you're already just as strong as me now. You're a full fledged master!\r\nKanami: ...Ah, thank you very much!\r\nMinato: My sweet, sweet, Kanami. I wish I could have held you with my real body instead. But, the sword is my everything. I gave it all I had.\r\nKanami: Motherr....!\r\nKagari: Hiyori...\r\nHiyori: Mom... Mom! Uu...\r\n\r\nKagari: Once you've gone ahead, you can't come back.\r\nHiyori: Right.

And how am I supposed to do that?\r\nKagari: You've always been so lively though.\r\nMinato: Watching those girls, you can tell just how happy we must have been on the other side, can't you.\r\nKagari: I know.\r\nMinato: Heyyy, why don't you come out and join us-? You're here with us too, aren't you?\r\nMinato: Want to have a match with me, before we disappear? I bet you're still sore about losing to me.\r\nTagitsu: ...Very well. Though, I cannot say how much time we have remaining.\r\nMinato: Eheheheh!\r\n\r\nHiyori: Kanami.\r\nKanami: It's alright. I'm right here.\r\nHiyori: Don't let go of my hand, no matter what.\r\nKanami: Yeah. I'll never let go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Recent Activities Report\r\n\r\nAnd then, several days passed. When the cherry blossoms were in full bloom--\r\n\r\nMihono: It's been a while since we got to meet face to face like this, huh!\r\nKiyoka: You say a while, but it's only been about a week, right?\r\nMihono: Wait, really? I've been way too busy lately, so I've kinda lost my sense of time.\r\nKiyoka: There are so many more aradama appearing then before, aren't there. It happens often that you think you're done suppressing some, but then they send you straight on to the next.\r\nMihono: There's that too, but, I've been busy studying...\r\nKofuki: Huhh? If you're gonna lie about it, at least come up with something better than that.\r\nMihono: Rude-! Is it that weird for me to be studying?\r\nKofuki: No duh, it's weird. Putting it straight, you're a moron, Ahocchi.\r\nMihono: Gagh! That's way too straight! I mean, sure, my grades aren't great, but...\r\nKofuki: They're not even at the level of \"not great\". You're at the level where you'd get called into the guidance counseling office even though you're in an escalator school. That's the place you're supposed to go for advice, not where they have to call you.\r\nMihono: Aha... Ahahahaha...\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, that's not something you should laugh about...\r\nMihono: I know, right... But, still! You're the weird one for being able to pass on into high school, Fukki! You traitor!\r\nKofuki: What do you mean, traitor? It's a damn escalator school! You normally just pass right into high school! You're the weird one whose grades are too bad to do that!\r\nKofuki: ...Ah! Mihocchi! I mean, Ahocchi! Hey! You think that I'm a moron like you, don't you!\r\nMihono: .........Uhh. S-So anyway, Chii-nee, what's it like in college? It's probably different from high school, right?\r\nKofuki: And now you're forcing your way off the subject!\r\nChie: Hmm~, the lectures are so technical, and everyone looks so adult. I'm feeling nervous every day.\r\nKofuki: You look plenty adult yourself, Chichie. Especially your tits.\r\nChie: Ufufu, that's very funny of you. Kofuki-chan, will you come with me under the shade of that tree?\r\nKofuki: Hey, come on... That smile freaks me out, so quit it... Okay? Miss Vice Captain!\r\nChie: Ah... You know, is it really alright for me to take the position of vice captain of the investigation team?\r\nKiyoka: I think you're perfect for the job!\r\nMirja: You were appointed to the position precisely because those in charge found you suited for it. Rather, I believe you should have been officially given this position long ago.\r\nChie: If that's how you feel, then I'm happy to hear it. You've been busy researching Kashuu Kiyomitsu, haven't you, Mirja, Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKiyoka: We have! There's been so many documents to search through... It's a lot of work!\r\nMirja: We've spent day after day secluded in the Sword Administration Bureau's reference room.\r\nMihono: And what've you been up to, Fukki?\r\nKofuki: What, me? I've been joining Kaoru and Sayaka's raid unit, spending the days having fun with aradama-chan.\r\nKofuki: Ah~, by the way, where's Yui at?\r\nMirja: She has a routine health examination today. She should be at the hospital right now.\r\nKiyoka: She told me earlier, along with getting her checkup, she's going to check in on Hana-san.\r\nMihono: That's right, Hana's doing her best with her rehab, so I've gotta try my hardest too!\r\nMihono: Huh? Kashuu Kiyomitsu is crying out? Is it resonating?\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, what is it?\r\nMihono: Sorry, I'm gonna go check on something!\r\nKiyoka: Wait, where are you going?\r\nMihono: I don't really know either! But, I'll be back before the operation starts!\r\n\r\nHana: Come on... Didn't I tell you, you shouldn't come back! My rehabilitation's going fine. That's all you have to tell the others.\r\nHana: You should get it, don't you! Since you were a Myouga toji too... Yui!\r\nYui: Hana-san...\r\nHana: How could I face them, if I saw them again...\r\nHana: The more the spell Tagitsuhime had over me comes undone, the more I get control over myself... The more I feel this stabbing in my heart...\r\nYui: Nobody in the investigation team thinks it's your fault for what you did!\r\nYui: We're waiting for you... For you to come back to us. We're all waiting.\r\nHana: If only... that's true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Return of Those You Await\r\n\r\nMihono: I had this feeling, like Kashuu Kiyomitsu was telling me to come here, but, what am I even doing?\r\nMihono: The operation's going to start soon too, so I'd better get back.\r\nMihono: It did it again... You're telling me not to go? Kiyomitsu... What are you trying to get me to do?\r\nMihono: Hey... Kiyomitsu!\r\nHiyori: The cherry blossoms...\r\nKanami: It's already spring, isn't it...\r\nKanami: What do you want to do first, Hiyori-chan? You'd want to eat chocolate mint, right?\r\nHiyori: I wouldn't mind...!\r\nMihono: K-Kanami! Juujou-san!?\r\nKanami: Eh? Mihono-chan? That means, we really did...\r\nHiyori: We made it back, didn't we...!\r\nMihono: Welcome back!\r\n\r\nMihono: Aww~, I couldn't win in the end this year either. Guess it wasn't going to go that easy!\r\nMihono: But, next time for sure...!\r\nReferee: Those who will be advancing to the finals, both of you, step forward!\r\nKanami/Hiyori: Yes ma'am!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Swords Gathered at Their Master's Side\r\n\r\nOne day, in May. After the tournament, yet another month has passed. The toji are now in the midst of their new routine--\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Since the \"Great Year-End Disaster\", each organization has grown more active, and on top of that, there are sign of various groups forming behind closed doors. Fending each of them off is only becoming more difficult.\r\nSuzuka: The burden on Akane-sama as well, though it may not appear to be great at the moment, will only grow, as I believe it's only it's only a matter of time before someone appears to openly challenge her.\r\nSuzuka: At present, this is about all I am able to report.\r\nYukari: ...I see, I understand. I'm sorry, you three, for asking so much of you today.\r\nYukari: But, I wanted to hear it directly from the Special Defense Team... From you, who work immediately under Akane.\r\nMaki: Yukari-sama, how is your body doing now?\r\nYukari: I'm fine. Doing well enough, at least, for me to finish what business I have left to pass the torch on.\r\nSuzuka: Don't say that... Someday, we'll need you to return to your office, Yukari-sama...\r\nYukari: No, I plan to leave everything to Akane, and remove myself from the public eye.\r\nYukari: At any rate, in the state I'm in now, I've lost even my power as a toji.\r\nMaki: ...From when you sealed off the netherworld?\r\nYukari: That's right. It consumed all my strength to finish. Right now, I can hardly even wield an okatana.\r\nYukari: Even if my body were to make a full recovery, being able to stand again as a toji is something I can't much hope for.\r\nYukari: That's how things are, Yume. You won't be able to charge me without warning like you once used to.\r\nYume: So I won't get to play with Yukari-sama anymore... That's so boring.\r\nMaki: Hey, Yume! Yukari-sama, I'm very sorry about her.\r\nYukari: Don't think anything of it.\r\nYume: Still, wouldn't it be great if Yomi-onee-san could be here with us too! Just like things used to be! We'd all be together then!\r\nYukari: There are some concerning aspects to Yomi's condition, but she seems to be gradually recovering.\r\nYume: Then, when Yomi-onee-san gets back, I want us to go somewhere together again! Like, when we all went flower viewing!\r\nYume: Don't ask the impossible, Yume. You know what position Yukari-sama is in...\r\nYukari: No, when Yomi comes back to us, I'll work something out.\r\nYume: You mean it!? Hooray-!\r\nYukari: It won't be long before the four of you are together once more, as the Special Defense Team.\r\nYukari: ...And, from here on, Akane will face more enemies than I did. Please, do all you can to look after her.\r\nYui: Sure thing! No matter who crosses us, I'll keep Akane-sama safe!\r\nYukari: I see... I'm depending on you, Yume.\r\nYume: Yeah! Just leave it to me!\r\nSuzuka: If only we could afford to spare more personnel. As of now, we're short of hands wherever we go.\r\nYukari: I'd like to have Yamashiro Yui join as well, though I have my concerns after her doubled usage of the ampoules. It's a difficult decision to make.\r\nMaki: If only the rate of aradama appearances would go down at least. At this rate...\r\nYukari: There's no use lamenting what can't be changed. All that's left is to search for the best solution at hand.\r\nMaki: Still, under Yanase's guidance, the next generation of toji are noticeably improving their skills.\r\nSuzuka: If the shortage of toji is solved, and we can reinforce each station, the number of opportunities we'll have together should grow.\r\nYume: And then, I'll let you see a whole lot of what makes me so great! Okay, Yukari-sama!\r\nYukari: Of course. Once that time comes, that is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Push On, Special Raid Unit! (1)\r\n\r\nKaoru: Oh, there you are, Kofuki!\r\nNene: Nenne-!\r\nKofuki: Yeah, thanks for letting me tag along again today.\r\nTsugumi: 1104 hours. Shichinosato Kofuki makes contact with the captain of the Special Raid Unit, Mashiko Kaoru, as well as the aradama \"Nene\".\r\nKaoru: I'll have you working your butt off again, Kofuki. It's a real big help having you around.\r\nKofuki: I'll take care of all the aradama-chan, so you can take a nap or whatever!\r\nKaoru: That's a great idea. I'd love to!\r\nNene: Nenne-!\r\nTsugumi: 1105 hours. Mashiko Kaoru accepts Shichinosato Kofuki's proposal to take a nap.\r\nSayaka: Kaoru. Director Maniwa will get mad again.\r\nKofuki: You can go ahead and take a break too, Sayaka. I can handle this just fine on my own!\r\nTsugumi: Likewise, 1105 hours. Shichinosato Kofuki makes contact with the vice captain of the Special Raid Unit, Itomi Sayaka.\r\nSayaka: Carelessness isn't allowed. And also, suppressing aradama is my job.\r\nKofuki: Man, you always love doing things by the book.\r\nKaoru: But hey, haven't you been working with us more than the investigation team lately?\r\nKaoru: Everywhere you go, they're short on people, but we've got it real bad here. Wouldn't it be best if you just officially transferred to us?\r\nKaoru: You'd get to fight all the aradama you want. They totally ignore the Labor Standards Act, so you'd get worked you to the bone till you're run ragged.\r\nTsugumi: 1107 hours. Mashiko Kaoru solicits Shichinosato Kofuki to join the Special Raid Unit, while criticizing the organization.\r\nKofuki: But, if I can't see Ahocchi's Miho side... Ah, I messed it up!\t\t[Aho means dumb, and it's just a play on the nicknames]\r\nKofuki: I'd get lonely, not getting to see Mihocchi's aho side! So I'll pass on that for now!\r\nKaoru: Sayaka's value's going way up too. If we added you to us, we'd be unstoppable.\r\nKaoru: And then, as the captain, my value'd go up as well, and I might even get promoted out of here.\r\nNene: Nene-!\r\nTsugumi: 1109 hours. Mashiko Kaoru expresses her desire to withdraw from the Special Raid Unit, and to raise her own status.\r\nSayaka: Kaoru, you want to be promoted?\r\nKaoru: If I make it big, I'll get to make others do the work, and I'll get to kick back, won't I?\r\nSayaka: If you make it big, I think you'll get even busier.\r\nKaoru: .........Aghh~, I don't wanna work anymore-!\r\nTsugumi: 1110 hours. Mashiko Kaoru expresses a clear desire to sabotage the chain of command. I posit that this is necessary to report to General Director Maniwa.\r\nKaoru: Hey, shut up already! What's your deal, anyway!? This whole time! You've just been going on to yourself, like you can't even read the mood! You know we can hear everything you're saying!?\r\nKofuki: Ahh, she's an operator from the aradama research team. You should've at least seen her around before.\r\nTsugumi: I'm to accompany you today, so that I can gather practical combat data from Shichinosato-san. My name is Ban Tsugumi. Nice to meet you.\r\nKaoru: Is it really okay, letting an operator tag along to the scene of a fight? Wouldn't it be best to get her some bodyguards?\r\nKofuki: She'll be fine. She knows what to do with this sorta thing. She used to be a toji herself, so she's got skills of her own.\r\nTsugumi: Today, I will be dedicated to gathering data, so please don't pay me any mind.\r\nKaoru: Okay then. Well, if Kofuki says you'll be fine, then you probably will. Though, try not to do anything too crazy.\r\nTsugumi: Of course, I won't.\r\nSayaka: Kaoru, it's almost time to start the operation.\r\nKaoru: Can't catch a break... Then, start doing what you can.\r\nKofuki: Hell yeah! Here I come, my lovely aradama-chan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Push On, Special Raid Unit! (2)\r\n\r\nKofuki: Give me more! I still haven't had my fun yet! Where's the next aradama at!?\r\nKaoru: She's seriously so full of energy it's unbelievable...\r\nSayaka: It would be good if you could learn to be a little more like Kofuki, Kaoru.\r\nKaoru: I'm best suited to be a boss for capable recruits like you two! That's how the Special Raid Unit should work! Right, Nene?\r\nKaoru: ...Huh? Nene?\r\nTsugumi: [fluff fluff]... [fluff fluff]...\r\nNene: Nenne-! Nenne-! Nenenenne-!\r\nTsugumi: [fluff fluff]... [fluff fluff]... [fluff fluff fluff]... \r\nNene: Nenenenene-!\r\nTsugumi: Aradama Nene shows a tendency of preferring to be touched to the side of the abdomen rather than straight on...\r\nKaoru: What are you even doing playing around with Nene?\r\nTsugumi: You see, there are practically no opportunities to make direct physical contact with an aradama, so I thought I would gather some data.\r\nTsugumi: Today I have been able to gather practical combat data from not only Shichinosato-san, but also from Itomi-san and you, Mashiko-san, which will make for very good reference material.\r\nKaoru: I see, well that's good to hear then.\r\nTsugumi: 1308 hours. Today's record will come to an end for the time being.\r\nTsugumi: Now then, I will gather there recordings into a report and present everything to General Director Maniwa today. Thank you very much for having me.\r\nKaoru: Sure, thanks for putting in the effort. Wait, hold on... You're gonna present everything to the director... Hey!\r\nKaoru: You're not seriously gonna report every single thing I said to her, are you-!? GIVE ME A BREAAAAAAAK!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: We Aren't at Our Limit Yet!\r\n\r\nKanami: Ah, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: Kanami-chan, it's been a while!\r\nKanami: Yeah, it really has, hasn't it! Are you finished working at that whatever it was institute?\r\nMai: The Special Rare Metals Utilization Research Institute. For now, it feels like we've come to a stopping point, I think?\r\nKanami: That's good then. It means you can take it easy for a while, right?\r\nMai: I can't exactly do that.\r\nMai: As a representative of the Yanase Group, I need to help with the development of a new model of Storm Armor.\r\nMai: And also, to counter the increasing amount of aradama incidents, I have to put even more effort into raising up our underclassmen.\r\nKanami: You're amazing... It's hard to even think I'm in the same grade as you anymore, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: You're amazing in that regard yourself, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: Eh? What's so amazing about me?\r\nMai: All your accomplishments lately! From the rumors, they're calling you the strongest toji right now!\r\nKanami: That's the first I've heard of it!? ...Wait? Are you sure it's not a joke?\r\nMai: It's true. They say nobody can match up against you. That you're unstoppable.\r\nKanami: They're exaggerating way too much! Even compared to Master, I still have a long long way to go!\r\nKanami: And besides, I even lost to Hiyori-chan at the tournament not that long ago? I've gotta keep trying way harder to keep up too!\r\nKanami: And also, there's still Yume-chan, and they're saying Sayaka-chan is getting a lot stronger too!\r\nMai: Fufufu! That modest attitude of yours might be the secret to your strength, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: I haven't gotten to see Hiyori-chan in a long while either. It's like she's always been busy. I'd really like to have a sparring session with her though.\r\nKanami: You've been busy too, Mai-chan, but don't push yourself too hard, okay? If your body breaks down, it'll all go to waste.\r\nMai: You're right. Let's both take good care of ourselves. Anyway, I have a report to make! I'll talk to you later!\r\nKanami: Sure! See you around, Mai-chan!\r\nKanami: ...Everybody's working so hard.\r\nKanami: But I can do it too-! After all, we've still got a long way to go before we hit our limits!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: The Investigation Team's Day-To-Day (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: Sighhh~~~...\r\nYui: What's this, somebody's looking tired. If you want, I'll pump you full of energy with a hug~! Hey, come on! Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Ahh~, Yui. No thanks...\r\nYui: What's wrong, Mihono-chan? Did you wind up seriously falling in love with me? If that's what it is, then you're super welcome you know!\r\nMihono: Ahaha, I'm just a little worn out from studying. I'll be fine, just fine...\r\nChie: I'm so proud of you, Mihono-chan, that you've studied till you're tired. Up till now, you would always do everything you could to get away from textbooks.\r\nMihono: That's cause, things are so bad I can't afford to run away anymore... If things keep up, I might really not make it into high school...\r\nChie: E-Err~... That sure sounds serious, doesn't it...\r\nMihono: It's bad enough just studying, but on top of that, just how many aradama do I have to fight every day? I'm dead tired...\r\nMihono: Ah, let's talk about something nicer! Let's change the topic to something happy! Like, if you've had any yummy cream puffs or something!\r\nYui: Then, I've got just the thing! Hana-san's rehabilitation is going great, and it looks like she's making a steady recovery!\r\nMihono: Really? That's so good to hear... Hopefully Hana can make it out of the hospital soon!\r\nMirja: It truly is. I can only pray for her speedy recovery.\r\nYui: Ah, Kiyoka-chan, Mirja-san! You two are looking as lovely as ever today. Want a hug?\r\nMirja: I'll have to refuse.\r\nKiyoka: I'm going to refuse too.\r\nYui: There you go again~, acting like we're strangers! You know you're always welcome to one!\r\nChie: Hey, how has your research into Kashuu Kiyomitsu been going? Have you been making progress since last time?\r\nKiyoka: Unfortunately, we haven't found enough leads to say we've made any progress...\r\nMirja: Rather, it appears as though someone has intentionally removed details regarding Kashuu Kiyomitsu from the records.\r\nMirja: Even at Asakura Mihono's home... We paid a visit to the Asakura Shrine, but there didn't seem to be any records of note there.\r\nKiyoka: For an okatana that once suppressed a great aradama before, there should be more records of it left behind...\r\nMihono: I guess so... Well, I never heard anything about it either. Mom and Grandpa never talked about it.\r\nMihono: By the way, I don't see Fukki around. Is she out somewhere?\r\nMirja: If you're looking for Shichinosato Kofuki, she's currently on an aradama suppression mission with the Special Raid Unit.\r\nKiyoka: Whenever she doesn't have a mission with the investigation team, she's there with them practically every day.\r\nMihono: Well, it is Fukki, so she's probably just happy about getting to play with aradama.\r\nYui: Mmhmm, that's got to be it! The way she innocently plays around with aradama; Kofuki-san's a real angel-!\r\nChie: The rate of aradama appearances has only gone up since the \"Great Year-End Disaster\". The Special Raid Unit must really value her too.\r\nMihono: Must be fun, getting to do what you love every day~! I'm so jealous of Fukki~!\r\nAnnouncement: Aradama have appeared in an urban area! Toji are to intercept at once. I repeat--\r\nMirja: We have a mission to sortie. All members, mobilize quickly!\r\nMihono: Eh...! But, Fukki's not here!\r\nYui: But, you have me here in her place! This is the first big chance I've had to show off my cool side in a while! Okaaay~, here I go-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: The Investigation Team's Day-To-Day (2)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan, you've really grown a lot stronger, haven't you! We hardly had a chance to step in.\r\nYui: Ehehe, you could tell? I've actually been doing super well lately! Ah! Don't tell me, you've fallen for me all over again?\r\nKiyoka: .........Anyway, when we get back, we'll have to keep up our research on Kashuu Kiyomitsu.\r\nYui: Ah! You're just forcing your way off the subject! Come on-... Though, the way you act like that makes my heart skip a beat too-! Badump badump!\r\nMihono: And I'll have to keep reading textbooks. Aghh~, my heart's gonna break...\r\nMihono: No, wait! I can't lose my nerve now! They say every pinch you get in is just another opportunity! Uagh~! Where there's a will, there's a way!\r\nChie: You still have another year too. Hang in there, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Urgh! That's right... Th-There's still another year of this... Of this studying hell...\r\nMirja: I won't permit something so shameful as for our investigation team to have a failed student. Do I make myself clear, Asakura Mihono...?\r\nMirja: Do. I. Make. Myself. Clear?\r\nMihono: AHII!? Ahh... Y-Yess...\r\nMihono: This year! In both my studies and my missions! I-I'll do my best!\r\n\r\nIn a virtual space established on a private network, connected over a special line--\r\n\r\nYoung Man: Well now, two of us are absent... This is a rarity. As far as I recall, this is the first it's happened, isn't it?\r\nElderly Man: It seems that some of the Origami protoge's little mice have slipped their way in. I'm told they were off handling it.\r\nElderly Man: What else can we expect from Yukari's protege. They seem to be some exceptionally talented little mice at that.\r\nMiddle Aged Man A: What's worse, if we ever show her an opening, the woman herself will try taking it in. She's devious.\r\nMiddle Aged Man A: Even in the best circumstances, our counter-intelligence is in a precarious position.\r\nMiddle Aged Man B: It's finally awakened, and at a time we lack the funds, time, or people...\r\nYoung Woman: Oh...? And are the \"people\" you mention those idealists you send to die whenever it's convenient? Sacrificial pawns are something you'll always run short of.\r\nMiddle Aged Man B: Bold words... For a newcomer.\r\nMiddle Aged Man A: All the same, I'd like to leave off our concentrated investments into Tokyo at that.\r\nMiddle Aged Man A: This reconstruction bubble, it's nothing more than a smokescreen after all.\r\nElderly Woman: The Sword Administration Bureau too, would they only be dear and devote themselves to the grunts. The grunts have no need of the brains, do they.\r\nYoung Man: Then, as the brains, why not do as brains do and move to discuss the matter at hand...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: The Whole Story\r\n\r\nKaoru: That jackass... She actually went and told her everything! How can somebody be that clueless!?\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nSayaka: Kaoru, you aren't supposed to talk until you're done. And also, you were the one in the wrong.\r\nKaoru: Grgh... Aghh-, there, it's done! Is that fine with you! I wrote my apology letter!\r\nSana: Ohh-, you're finally through writing that thing.\r\nSana: Don't blame Ban for this. Let this be your lesson not to criticize the higher-ups, when you're on the record, that is.\r\nKaoru: I didn't even say anything that bad, so why'd I have to write all this...\r\nSana: Anywhere you look, you can find people who'll complain about our structure and methods of their organization.\r\nSana: Would you rather we did something else? We could cancel your vacation time, or dock your salary?\r\nKaoru: Grgh... What's with this crooked administration!\r\nSana: Kaoru... We understand full well that the Special Raid Unit is caught up in some hard work.\r\nSana: But, you get that work because of what we believe you're capable of, since you're a reliable captain. Understand?\r\nKaoru: I get it!\r\nSana: Ah-, and also. If you're going to crticize the higher-ups, do it more boldly. When you meet the ones who complain about everything face to face, they almost always bite their tongue.\r\nKaoru: ...I got it!"}, {"paste_key": "BrZ3asPD", "title": "china yui episode", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/BrZ3asPD", "timestamp": "", "hits": "101", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/Wuef7y1z6Q4\r\n[China - Yui: Start]: The Chinatown Date I've Longed For!?\r\n\r\nTsugumi: We've safely eliminated the aradama, so while we're here, why don't we take a stroll around Chinatown until the sun starts setting?\r\nMihono: I'm all for it~! There's still a lot more shops I haven't been to yet. Do you two wanna come with me?\r\nYui: Of course I do!\u3000It's a Chinatown date with two good looking girls at my side! This makes fighting off those aradama all worth it~.\r\nYui: Date~! Date~! Chinatown date~!\r\nMihono: You're sure in a good mood, Yui.\r\nYui: You know I am! Taking a beauty like you on a date through Chinatown; that's the kind of classic date course I've been dreaming of!\r\nTsugumi: ...\r\nYui: Hm? What's up, Tsugumi-san? Ah-- Don't tell me, you're getting jealous I'm giving Mihono-chan all the attention?\r\nTsugumi: No, not once this whole time have I ever felt anything like that...\r\nYui: Then, what's that uneasy look on your face for?\r\nTsugumi: Sorry, it might be senseless of me to ask, but... I was just wondering, what is the definition of a \"date\" to begin with?\r\nYui: Tsugumi-san, you're such a serious going girl. When it comes to things like this, it's all about \"Don't think; feel!\"\r\nTsugumi: Go with your feelings without thinking... Is that it. Then, coming up with feelings regarding dating... How exactly do you do that?\r\nYui: That's easy! Right now, I'll swap between taking you and Mihono-chan on a Chinatown date with me, to give you the dating experience!\r\nMihono: The dating experience?\r\nYui: Yeah! I've spent a lot of time mentally rehearsing for the ultimate heart-pounding Chinatown date, so I'll show you a good time for sure!\r\nTsugumi: If you're that sure then, Yamashiro-san... It might not be so bad to get an experience of the real thing.\r\nYui: That's the spirit! So then, to start us off... I think I'll take out Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Ehh-- Starting with me!? If you just tell me we're going on a date like that, I don't have time to get my heart ready...\r\nYui: Don't you worry about that, Honey. I'll escort you around just right. Why don't we find somewhere to get some delicious sweets first?\r\n\r\nYui: This place sells the apricot seed soft serve that's the talk of Chinatown! I don't have much pocket money on me today, so let's share one between us. Here, open wide.\r\nMihono: Ahhn. [chew chew]... It's yummy-!!\r\nYui: Alright, now it's your turn, Mihono-chan! I'll say \"ahh\", and you...\r\nMihono: Ah, look, look! In that general store next door! They've got cute panda things you can wear!\r\nYui: Ah, wait, Mihono-chaaan!\r\nMihono: Tadahhh! Check it out! See this panda hat I got! Does it look good?\r\nYui: Mmm~! It's good; so good~! Next up, let's try this Chinese hat~! Uwah~! This one looks good too~.\r\nTsugumi: ...\r\nTsugumi: Um, would it be alright if we stopped for a moment?\r\nYui: Hmmm? What's the matter, Tsugumi-san? Hahahn~, now are you feeling jealous of me with Mihono-chan...\r\nTsugumi: That's not it. It's just that, I've started to have my doubts about all this. Eating sweets together, and excitedly shopping. It's true that it does seem like you two are having lots of fun, but...\r\nTsugumi: It also seems as if nothing has changed from when the three of us were going around together before. Can you really call this an example of a date...?\r\nMihono: You're right. It was a lot of fun, but if I had to say either way, this isn't any different from everyone hanging out together, is it-?\r\nTsugumi: Yamashiro-san, is it really fine to classify this under the definition of a date?\r\nYui: Uuu~, when you put it like that, I'm losing confidence. Could I have a little time to think this over?\r\nYui: Get ahold of yourself, Yui. Remember the strongest Chinatown fantasy date plan you fantasized about over and over day after day. Chinatown... Chinatown... When I think of an ideal date in Chinatown, it's gotta be...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[China - Yui: End]: A Practice Run!? Yui's Fantasy Chinatown Date!\r\n\r\nYui: Chinatown date... Chinatown date... When I think of situations for the Chinatown date I've been dreaming of, there's...\r\nYui: That'll do~!!!!!\r\nMihono: You look like a lightbulb went off in your head, Yui.\r\nTsugumi: She does. And, it's somewhat unsettling...\r\nYui: Anyway, let's get back into it, and swap partners! I'll need you to be play my girlfriend now, Tsugumi-san!\r\nTsugumi: (Sigh, of course it would come to this. Though, I was the one who asked what a date was to start, so I can't back out now, can I...)\r\nTsugumi: Understood. Then, please go easy on me.\r\nYui: Just leave that to me! Anyway, let's start right off by holding hands! [squeeze~]. Woww, Tsugumi-san, your hands are so soft and warm~!\r\nTsugumi: Y-Yamashiro-san! What are you doing? You got too close all of a sudden!\r\nYui: See, I remembered. When you think of a date, it means the two of you are closer than friends! That means, the two of us need to have a closeness deeper than friendship.\r\nTsugumi: Deeper than friendship... Is that so.\r\nYui: That's right! For example, if, while everyone's watching, I gave you a deep kiss!\r\nYui: And then, and then, if I took you someplace where no one's around, like a park or back alley, and when it's just the two of us, we... Ehehe... Ehehe...\r\nTsugumi: I-Is that what it means...  I think I understand the gist of it now, so don't you think we can end our fake date here?\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah. I think so too... The sun's going to go down soon too, so why don't we head home for today...\r\nYui: Ehh-, just hang on! We were only just getting started-!\r\nYui: Uuuu... Just when it was looking like we were going to get into the juicy stuff; I'm such an idiot! I should have way more stuff in my stock of fantasies that'll make girl's hearts pound-!\r\nYui: Ah-! I know! I have the strongest Chinatown date plan in history here! Hey, you two-, wait for me-!\r\nYui: I thought up the strongest Chinatown date plan! So please! Will you at least hear me walk you through it? If this doesn't make your hearts throb, then I'll take this as my loss!\r\nTsugumi: We weren't competing to see if you won or lost in the first place... But, if you're that adamant about it, we can at least hear you out.\r\nMihono: Yeah. It's fine if you're only going to talk... And plus, I'm a little curious what the strongest date plan is like!\r\nYui: Thanks so much, you two! It's that kind side of you that I love so much! Anyway, I'll get right to my presentation!\r\nYui: Our date starts off at a China dress shop in Chinatown! We put on matching dresses, and head out on the town!\r\nTsugumi: Matching China dresses... We're sticking to the assumption that this is a same sex female couple then...\r\nMihono: Still, this sounds exciting! You'd be happy to wear a cute dress, wouldn't you!\r\nYui: Right? So then, we eat some tasty food in Chinatown, and have a good time going around to all the cute general stores...\r\nMihono: That'd be fun~! But...\r\nTsugumi: Things have gone back to playing out exactly the same as before, haven't they...\r\nYui: Hold your horses-! The main event starts right here!\r\nYui: While the two of us are having a good time on our date, a group of burly thugs shows up and surrounds us, then tells you this:\r\nYui: \"Hey, pretty little thing, want to come have a good time with us...\"\r\nYui: That's when the thugs try to take you away by force. But then, I shout, \"Get your hands off my girlfriend-!\" and give the guys a high kick while I'm still in my China dress!\r\nYui: To protect the girl I love, I start pumping out stylish moves, taking down the punks one after another. And, completely captivated by me, my girlfriend says:\r\nYui: \"Thank you! I owe you my life. To make it up to you... You. Can. Have. Me...\"\r\nYui: Kyaa-! Y'know, you're a lot bolder than I thought... But, what kind of woman turns down a woman's advances! Now's not the time to hold ourselves back! And then, the two of us spend our sweet time together... Eheheheh...\r\nYui: So, what do you think? Don't you want to go on a date like that?\r\nMihono: Ummm... I want to wear a China dress, but... Everything after that is a little...\r\nTsugumi: To begin with, it's hard to imagine such a convenient group of thugs would appear at such convenient timing...\r\nYui: Come onnn... But I came up with the strongest, most exciting Chinatown fantasy date plan in history...\r\nYui: Wawah, Yui's all depressed now...\r\nTsugumi: If we were to leave her like this, it would weigh on our conscience, wouldn't it. We have to come up with something to support her...\r\nMihono: Yui, I think everybody has their own different kind of date they dream about, but I got to have a lot of fun today because you were with us! So thanks.\r\nTsugumi: That's right. And, I was able to mostly understand what the definition of a date is too...\r\nYui: You mean it!? I'm so glad~! I should be the one thanking you two! Getting to go on a three girl date through Chinatown made me the happiest girl in the world!\r\nTsugumi: A three girl date...? Can you really call an outing with three people a date? Sigh...

Why are you in such a rush?\r\nMihono: That's cause, I get to go on a big trip with Chii-nee, of course! There's a whole bunch of things I want to do, so I want to follow the schedule exactly.\r\nMihono: Ah! That reminds me. These are our schedules for this trip. This one's for you, Chii-nee.\r\nChie: You made these yourself!? They're thick too, aren't they...\r\nMihono: Ehehe. Once I started writing down all the places I wanted to see and the things I wanted to do, it started getting really long.\r\nChie: Fufu. Well, thank you for going to the trouble. And also, this schedule is so detailed, isn't it? You have what we'll be doing divided down to the minutes.\r\nMihono: I thought we'd get through every one of my goals for the trip, so it ended up being tighter than I expected. But, when it's us two, where there's a will, there's a way! Right?\r\nChie: Well, if we go down the list, we might be able to manage it... But, don't you think it would be better to relax a bit more?\r\nMihono: We can't do that! Let's do all of it! Cause we came on this trip together!\r\nChie: (? Mihono-chan's acting different than usual... I wonder what's gotten into her...)\r\nMihono: Hey, we can do all of it, right? That'll be fine, right, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: O-Of course, so long as you're happy, Mihono-chan. It is our last trip of the year, after all.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nChie: ...What's wrong? You're making such a sad face.\r\nMihono: Ah-! It's nothing! Yeah, I'm just fine! It's all alright!\r\nChie: Are you sure? Then, if you say so...\r\nChie: Oh, I'm getting a call from school. What if it's about a mission... I'll just step out of the compartment for a minute while I take this.\r\nMihono: She left...\r\nKiyoka: Oh? Hono-chan. What are you doing here? Are you going somewhere?\r\nMihono: Kiyoka! And Iwakura-san too! You too; what are you doing here?\r\nSanae: We're on our way to take care of an expedition assignment. Everyone else seems to already be on their New Year's break, but this is our last work day of the year.\r\nKiyoka: What about you, Hono-chan? You're already on your vacation, aren't you?\r\nMihono: Yeah! Chii-nee and me are using our New Year's break to go on a trip together, starting today. See, look at this! It's our trip guide. I made it myself, and I'm pretty proud of how it turned out!\r\nSanae: Wow, that's incredible! The schedule is packed tight too; it's just dripping with your excitement for the trip.\r\nKiyoka: It sure is. I think it seems like a little much to do in just two days and one night though...\r\nMihono: Well, that's because, Chii-nee's going to...\r\nMihono: Ah! Nevermind that! It's nothing, so don't worry about it! Okay!\r\nSanae: Doesn't it seem like Asakura-san was hiding something just now?\r\nKiyoka: It does. It's like Hono-chan's worried about something important on this trip...\r\nKiyoka: Ahh, while we were chatting, we arrived at our stop. Anyway, Hono-chan, have fun on your trip, okay.\r\nMihono: Thanks--! You two take care too!\r\nMihono: ...Chii-nee sure is taking a while. I wonder if she's still on the phone...\r\nChie: Mihono-chan, sorry I took so long! I bought ice cream from the train. Let's have it together.\r\nMihono: Awesome-! Thanks, Chii-nee! I'll dig right in...\r\nMihono: Wait, huh!? The ice cream's so frozen my spoon won't go in! \r\nChie: Fufu, you're right. It's a frozen as ice. We'll have to warm it up so it gets softer.\r\nChie: ~~! So cold! \r\nChie: !? Mihono-chan? You didn't have to take a picture now...\r\nMihono: But, isn't getting to see you warming up ice cream with your hands the kind of thing you'd see on a trip?\r\nChie: Honestly... Then, at least take it with the both of us. Just set it on a timer, and...\r\nChie: Oh, the ice cream's melting! Mihono-chan, here you go.\r\nMihono: Thanks! Ahhm!\r\nMihono: Look, look, Chii-nee! It took the picture right when we were taking abite!\r\nChie: Wow, it sure did! You can see the scenery out the window too. We've only just started and already we've gotten a wonderful photo of our trip.\r\nMihono: Yeah! Let's keep this up and make a whole bunch of memories here!\r\nChie: Sure!\r\nChie: ...Ah! It looks like we're here at the station. Mihono-chan, be sure you don't forget anything, okay?\r\n\r\nMihono: Here we are! In the guidebook, it says the locals welcome tourists here with singing and dancing, but...\r\nAradama: Guooooo...\r\nChie: Aradama! For them to be here of all places.\r\nMihono: And our trip's barely even started! We have to get rid of them quick, so we can make a bunch of memories like we planned on!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: It's Hard Sticking to the Schedule!?\r\n\r\nMihono: Phew, we beat the aradama, so let's get our trip back on track!\r\nChie: First, we need to try the limited offer mitarashi dango they sell at the station...\r\nChie: Oh no; they're all sold out for today!?\r\nMihono: Eh-!? But...\r\nShopkeeper: Sorry about that, we just sold out. If you'd been here five minutes sooner...\r\nMihono: Uuu... Just five minutes... If only those aradama weren't here...\r\nChie: There's nothing we can do about it. Even if we are off duty, it's still a toji's responsibility to suppress aradama.\r\nShopkeeper: Oh, you two were dealing with some aradama? Then, as thanks, take this. It's fresh bread from a local bakery.\r\nMihono: Whoaa~, it smells great. And it's warm too; I bet it's yummy!\r\nShopkeeper: About that bakery, they don't mention it in the guidebooks. It's a special little place only the locals know about. Here, eat it before it goes cold.\r\nChie: Thank you very much. Then, we'll take you up on that. Ohm...\r\nChie: Mm, it's delicious!\r\nMihono: It really is! This is good! It's nice and hot and fluffy; I feel like I could eat this forever!\r\nChie: Fufu, I'm glad to see you're cheering up now, Mihono-chan. Suppressing the aradama might have taken some of our time, but because of that, we found something nice we weren't expecting.\r\nMihono: Yeah, it's all because the locals were nice to us that we got to eat such good bread. This'll be a good memory too, won't it!\r\nSanae: Hm? We ran into each other again!\r\nChie: Kiyoka-chan, Sanae-chan! You two were on an expedition, weren't you? Did you finish that up already?\r\nSanae: Yes. We managed to take care of it sooner than expected, so I talked with Musumi-san about doing a little sightseeing before we went back.\r\nKiyoka: If you take the bus from in front of the station, you can get to a a lake with a power spot that's secretly famous.\r\nMihono: For real!? That wasn't in any of the guidebooks I read, but it sounds cool! Chii-nee, do you want to go check it out too?\r\nChie: Sure! Having a spur of the moment change of plans is part of the thrill of going on a trip. Let's go see!\r\nSanae: If we're all going, then let's hurry over to the bus stop. The bus only comes twice per day, so we have to be careful not to miss it.\r\nMihono: This place is that rare, huh! I'm getting excited; it's like we're going exploring!\r\nAradama: Guooooooo...\r\nMihono: Eh-!? More aradama!? This time for sure, I won't let them ruin our trip!\r\nKiyoka: Let's all fight our best, to get to that power spot!\r\nChie: Here I go! HAA!\r\nSanae: TAAAAAAH!\r\nKiyoka: Pant, pant... No matter how many we defeat, more are appearing... This might be too much for the four of us...\r\nMihono: Uuu... We're running out of time doing this too-!\r\nMaki: We'll be backing you up!\r\nSanae: Shidou-senpai!?\r\nMihono: And Tsubakuro-san too!\r\nYume: Kyahaha. Looks like I'll be able to beat a whole ton of them here!\r\nYume: EIII---!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: On a Big Fun Girls Tour Together!\r\n\r\nChie: With Shidou-san and Tsubakuro-san's help, we managed to clean them all out.\r\nSanae: But still, what brings you two here anyway?\r\nMaki: We were on our way back from an expedition, and just happened to be passing through. I'm glad we could lend a hand.\r\nYume: It wasn't really enough to satisfy me though-. And hey, what are those onee-sans looking all sad for?\r\nMihono: Uuu... The bus that only comes twice a day left already...\r\nKiyoka: It's a shame, but I'll have to come see this power spot another time. Sigh...\r\nChie: Hey, you two. There's so many other things left for us to do, soit's a waste for you to be moping around now. Let's cheer up and move on to our next destination!\r\nSanae: Setouchi-san is right! There should be plenty of things left that we can do now. Like, if we leave from this neighborhood now, we can...\r\nMaki: Nn? What's that? That big book with all those notes in it.\r\nSanae: It's the trip guidebook Asakura-san made. They were supposed to follow this and have a good time sightseeing, but then aradama appeared...\r\nMaki: I see. It must be frustrating having plans this detailed getting spoiled like that.\r\nYume: Let me see it too!\r\nYume: Hmm-! I didn't think there'd be this many neat sounding places this close by here.\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san, we should go see them too!\r\nMaki: Unfortunately, I've got another mission to take care of, so I can't guide you around. We can do it some other time.\r\nYume: Ehh-, but, after coming all the way out here, I wanna play around some-.\r\nChie: In that case, would you like to join us, Tsubakuro-san?\r\nMihono: Good idea! I wanna thank you for helping us out, and it's more fun with more people!\r\nSanae: Shidou-senpai, we'll take responsibility and make sure she gets home safe, so please don't worry and go on your mission.\r\nMaki: Alright. If you insist, then I guess I'll leave her with you.\r\nMaki: Yume, make sure you do what they tell you, okay?\r\nYume: Hooray-! Come on, onee-sans, let's go right now!\r\n\r\nChie: Wow, the stained glass is gorgeous. It was beautiful on the outside, but inside the building, there's such a lovely old fashioned feeling to it.\r\nMihono: A bunch of guidebooks said you just had to see the stained glass at this church!\r\n???: ~~\r\nYume: Huh? I hear some pretty voices singing.\r\nSanae: It sounds like it's practice time for the choir. Getting to hear hymns being sung live in such a romantic place is a real luxury!\r\nMihono: We must be really lucky, showing up just in time for them to start practicing!\r\nChie: That's for sure. Our plans were thrown off due to the aradama, but we got to experience something this nice thanks to it.\r\n\r\nSanae: So, next is a cake shop in a studio up in the mountains. Even though it's so far from town, there's so many customers here!\r\nKiyoka: It seems popular enough that people will come far and wide to eat here. Hono-chan, we found a really nice shop!\r\nMihono: Ehehe, we sure did! Still, there's so many different kinds of cakes, and they all look so good, that it's tough making up your mind!\r\nChie: Fufu, in that case, how about we split ours with each other? That way you can have double the cakes.\r\nMihono: Oh yeah! Nice idea! I'll have this strawberry shortcake then! I'll give you the part with the big strawberry, Chii-nee!\r\nChie: You can have the chestnuts off the top of my Mont Blanc then, Mihono-chan.\r\nYume: Those onee-sans really get along, don't they.\r\nKiyoka: They sure do. Just watching them together makes me feel happier.\r\nMihono: Phwah-! That tasted so good! Guys-, if you're done eating, next up is a horseriding experience at a farm close by!\r\nSanae: Even though we've been stopping by one place after another, there's still more to see? This really is a whirlwind tour.\r\nMihono: Since we had the chance to go on this trip, I wanted to do as much as we can before the sun goes down!\r\nYume: I want to ride on the horsies too! Let's go there fast, onee-sans!\r\nAradama: Guooooo...\r\nYume: Hey-! Why'd aradama have to come out now!\r\nMihono: We might've gotten to see a bunch of fun stuff because aradama messed up our schedule, but I still hate them getting in our way!\r\nChie: Agreed; let's make sure to defeat them now so they can't interrupt us any more!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Enjoying a Trip to the Hot Springs\r\n\r\nYume: Eh-, while we were busy beating the aradama, the sun went down!\r\nMihono: Uuu... After the horseriding, we were supposed to do mandarin picking at an orange farm, and then there were a ton ton ton more things I wanted to do---!\r\nChie: Mihono-chan, cheer up. It's gotten cold now, so wouldn't it be fine if we just relax at the ryokan and pass the end of the year together?\r\nChie: Getting in some hot springs and taking your time in a nice yet unfamiliar room is part of enjoying a trip too, isn't it?\r\nMihono: You're right, that does sound fun too, but... Uuu...\r\nKiyoka: Don't let it get you down, Hono-chan. We're going back now, but you two have a wonderful stay at a ryokan booked for you, don't you?\r\nSanae: That's right; didn't you write in the guide all the things you wanted to do in your room together? I'm sure you'll still have lots of fun from here!\r\nMihono: ...You're right! This is no time for me to be down in the dumps!\r\nYume: Thanks to you onee-sans, I got to have a really fun New Year's Eve~. Have fun at the hot springs, okay?\r\n\r\nMihono: Wow, this room is so pretty looking! Getting this whole big room just for me and Chii-nee is so deluxe-!\r\nChie: Isn't it? Let's take a short rest here, then go to the hot springs. It seems like they let you reserve open air baths too.\r\nMihono: Whoa-! I'm getting excited for it now! And dinner will be waiting for us after we get out of the baths, so there's still lots of fun to have together!\r\n\r\nMihono: Ahh-, I ate my fill back there. The hot springs felt so good after eating too. I'm feeling nice~.\r\nMihono: So, uh, next on the schedule is... An end of the year card tournament with Chii-nee!\r\nChie: Fufu, you're just full of energy, aren't you.\r\nChie: Mihono-chan, the year isn't quite over yet, but thank you for spending it with me.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee... Don't go saying it's over or anything!\r\nChie: Eh? Why not, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Ah... Nevermind, it's nothing. Sorry about that.  Now, where'd I put the cards...\r\nChie: (What's come over Mihono-chan? That reminds me, there was a time on the train ride when she acted different from her usual self too.)\r\nChie: (Maybe she was so excited for this that she couldn't sleep last night? If that's what it is, then I can't let her push herself too hard.)\r\nChie: Mihono-chan, come lie here on this futon for a minute.\r\nMihono: Eh? What's this for, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: You must be tired from running around since this morning, right? I'll give you a massage.\r\nMihono: Ehh!? You will?\r\nChie: Fufu, of course I will. It's a show of my appreciation for all the fun places you took me to. Here, lie down.\r\nMihono: If you say so, then...\r\nMihono: ...Ahh... That feels so good~.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee, your hands are so waaarm.\r\nChie: Fufu, just lie back and relax.\r\nMihono: Sure... Fuaahh... It's like my back is melting; it's too good~.\r\nMihono: Haa~... That feels nice...\r\nMihono: Fuah~... Nnn~... Zzz...\r\nChie: Oh, Mihono-chan? Fufu, she's sleeping now.\r\nChie: ...Her face is so innocent when she's asleep. I wonder what she's dreaming about.\r\nMihono: [mumble mumble]... Chii-nee... We're going here next...! Chii-nee... Ngh...\r\nChie: Even in her dreams, she's still leading me around. Thank you very much for taking me on a pleasant journey, Mihono-chan.\r\nChie: Yawn~. Looking at how happily Mihono-chan's sleeping is making me feel drowsy too.\r\nChie: It doesn't look like we'll be able to do a countdown to the new year, so I'll just lie down and we can sleep together.\r\n\r\nChie: [sleep breathing]...\r\nMihono: [sleep mumbling]...\r\nMihono: Nn...?\r\nMihono: WAHH------!!\r\nMihono: (No way-! I fell asleep!?)\r\nMihono: (What do I do now; we might not make it for the most important part of this trip--!!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/XL33MXyxw44?t=994\r\n5: Will We Make to the Main Event!?\r\n\r\nChie: ......? Mihono-chan? What's the matter? It's still pitch dark outside...\r\nMihono: Chii-nee, get up! If we don't get out there soon, the first sunrise'll happen!\r\nChie: If you want to see the sunrise, we can do it from the window here, you know.\r\nMihono: There's someplace I want to go with you no matter what though! I want us to see the first sunrise from there-!\r\nChie: (It's been on my mind ever since yesterday, but why is Mihono-chan acting so frantic? Does she have some special reason...?)\r\nChie: Alright then. If you really want to go, let's go see the first sunrise together.\r\n\r\nMihono: Uuu, I was prepared for this, but it's still freezing... Are you doing okay, Chii-nee? Sorry, for forcing you to come out in the cold with me.\r\nChie: I'm just fine. But, look at you, your hands are all red. Here, why not use my gloves?\r\nMihono: If I did that, then your hands would get cold! I'll be fine! See, I'm doing great...\r\nMihono: Achoo!\r\nChie: Honestly... You're pushing yourself so hard, Mihono-chan.\r\nChie: Here, we'll each wear one of my gloves. And then, we can hold each other's hands with the hand that doesn't have a glove on. Alright?\r\nMihono: Whoa! Your hand is so warm, Chii-nee.\r\nChie: Fufu, that's better, isn't it? It's almost time for the sunrise, so let's keep going!\r\nMihono: Yeah!\r\n\r\nChie: It's getting brighter out. Are we almost to where we're going?\r\nMihono: Ahh, look down the path! The first sunrise is coming up!\r\nChie: Wow... You're right! It's beautiful...!\r\nMihono: ...I'm so glad we made it. I got to see the first sunrise with Chii-nee...!\r\nChie: Mmhm. I'm glad I got to see such a beautiful sunrise with you, Mihono-chan.\r\nChie: Thank you for bringing me along.\r\nMihono: I'm really happy I got to see the first sunrise together with you too, Chii-nee.\r\nMihono: But...\r\nChie: What's wrong, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Fighting with aradama took up our time, so we didn't get to do half the things I wanted to...\r\nChie: Oh, Mihono-chan... Don't you think there were too many things to do on your list in the first place? Why were you so desperate to do them all?\r\nMihono: That's because...\r\nMihono: Since you're four grades higher, you're about to graduate before me, right? And, when you do, we might be split up again...\r\nMihono: So that's why, while we still have time together, I wanted to make as many memories as possible.\r\nChie: Mihono-chan...\r\nChie: Come here.\r\nMihono: Wah, you're making me embarassed, rubbing my head out here like that-.\r\nChie: Fufu, what's wrong with it.\r\nChie: You know, Mihono-chan. From now on, whatever path I take, the two of us will always be together. So don't worry.\r\nChie: So, the places we didn't get to go on this trip, we can go see together the next time.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee...\r\nChie: Fufu, thank goodness. You're smiling again, Mihono-chan.\r\nChie: I know, let's make a wish on the first sunrise. A wish that we'll be able to peacefully spend another year together.\r\nMihono: Good idea! After all we went through to see this sunrise, whatever we wish for is gonna get granted for sure!\r\nMihono/Chie: This year, and the next year, and every year after that, please let us stay happily together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/EgIu3T30SHE\r\n[Casual 20 - Mihono: Start]: Planning a New Year's Trip\r\n\r\nSeveral days before New Year's Eve.\r\n\r\nMihono: I can't take the local gourmet off the list after all, can I. But, I wanted to put the petting zoo in too...\r\nYui: Huh, what are you doing all by yourself there, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Yui, and Mirja-san too!\r\nMirja: That's quite a lot of guidebooks you have open. Are you going on a trip somewhere?\r\nMihono: I'm planning on doing an overnight trip on New Year's Eve with Chii-nee... And, I was checking what sights we should go see!\r\nYui: Two girls, taking a trip into the new year together... Just those words alone are enough to make your heart throb. Maybe I'll tag along too...\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui, that would be inconsiderate of you. And, if I recall, you have missions scheduled as far as New Year's Eve, don't you?\r\nYui: Ugh, you're right... I'm so jealous Mihono-chan and them get to take their New Year's break early-.\r\nMihono: Hang in there, Yui. I'll be sure to get souvenirs to bring back for everyone. \r\nYui: Souvenirs are nice and all, but more than that, I want to see lovey dovey photos of you two on your trip!\r\nYui: Please, help me get through my missions on New Year's Eve! Send them to me as you go! I'll be waiting for them!\r\nMihono: O-Okay, sure. I'll send them when I remember to.\r\nYui: If I can get some shots of two dreamy girls spending a heart-pounding New Year's tour together, I feel like I'll be able to pull through! You have to send them to me no matter what! It's a promise!\r\nMihono: Okay, I'll do what I can, but, what kind of photos do you want anyway?\r\nYui: Let's see... How about, photos of the two of you feeding each other food you bought on the train, like, \"Ahhn\"!\r\nYui: And then, photos of you staring deep into each others' eyes on the beach while you share your love, and photos of the two of you proposing in a romantic church deep in the mountains!\r\nMirja: I can't help but feel your suggestions are leading towards something other than a normal tour for two girls...\r\nMihono: Well, I was hoping to have something a little more exciting for us to do together, but do you have any ideas, Mirja-san?\r\nMirja: If you are planning a New Year's trip, a shrine visit and viewing the first sunrise would be standard suggestions.\r\nMirja: And, if time permits, it might be good to work in something slightly more original.\r\nMihono: Something more original? Like what?\r\nMirja: For example, rather than simply viewing the first sunrise on New Year's day, why not admire the setting sun on New Year's Eve?\r\nMirja: It's something I've considered for some time now. Everyone glorifies the year's first sunrise, but why do they pay no attention to the year's last sunset?\r\nMihono: You're right, every year things are so busy on the evening of New Year's Eve that I don't think I've ever sat back and watched the sun go down.\r\nYui: Yeah yeah, me too-.\r\nYui: But you know, if I were the sun, I'd be happy having everyone admire me on New Year's morning, but I think I'd want people admiring me on the last sunset after I worked so hard all year too!\r\nMirja: I've never exactly thought about how it would make the sun feel...\r\nMirja: I've always thought that those who can appreciate the sunset, the same as they would the sunrise, will get the most benefit from the year's first sunrise the next morning.\r\nMihono: I get it! I think that's a great way of looking at it. It might give us better fortune from watching the sunrise, so I I'll try putting watching the sunset into our plan too!\r\nMihono: Okaaay, now just to find the perfect place to watch the sunset with Chii-nee!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Casual 20 - Mihono: End]: At the Year's Final Sunset...\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Eve. Partway through Mihono and Chie's trip together, they happened to meet Kiyoka, Sanae, and Yume, and all went to watch the sunset from an observation tower together.\r\n\r\nMihono: Chii-nee, look, look! The setting sun looks so pretty!\r\nChie: It sure is pretty, isn't it. Ah, Mihono-chan, it looks like we can go out onto the deck from there.\r\nMihono: Whoa, the wind's strong out here. Chii-nee, be careful so your scarf doesn't get blown away, okay!\r\nChie: Right. You too, Mihono-chan; be sure your hat doesn't get swept off. Though, the air is nice and clear up here too.\r\nMihono: Yeah, it might be cold, but getting to see the sunset so clearly is the best! Oh yeah! Chii-nee, let's take a picture!\r\nChie: Another picture? You've been taking them nonstop ever since this morning.\r\nMihono: We're on a big trip together, so don't you want to have a bunch of things to remember it by? Kiyoka, could you take our picture with my phone?\r\nKiyoka: I don't mind, but, Hono-chan, with all the pictures you're taking, your phone must be running out of space, right? I'll take it on my phone and send it to you later.\r\nMihono: You will? Thanks. That's a big help-.\r\nKiyoka: Okay, Hono-chan, Setouchi-san, please come up with a pose!\r\nChie: Umm, a pose... What should we...\r\nKiyoka: If you want to give off a fun mood, how about if you do something like throwing both hands up in the air?\r\nMihono: Like this? Banzai-!\r\nKiyoka: Yeah, that's great, Hono-chan! Though, you still had your phone in your hand... Next, how about you stay just like that, but hold each other's hands?\r\nMihono: That might look good! Come on, hold my hand, Chii-nee! Yayyy!\r\nMihono: WAH---- What do I do!? I dropped my phone!\r\nChie: Eh-!? You mean right now, when we held hands?\r\nMihono: I think so. It's not on the floor here, so don't tell me...\r\nYume: You were swinging your hands all around, Onee-san, so I think it might've fallen all the way off the deck.\r\nMihono: No way...\r\nSanae: This observation tower is a hundred meters up off the ground too. There's a cliff below us, so I don't think it could have hit anybody, but if it hit the rocks down there, it would have broken for sure...\r\nMihono: I don't believe it... And I took so many pictures all day too-. Uuu... How could something like this happen...\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, sorry. This all happened because I got carried away and asked you to do poses.\r\nMihono: It's not your fault, Kiyoka. I was the one who let go because I wasn't careful.\r\nMihono: Sigh... For me to mess up this bad at the very very end of the year; my luck is the worst.\r\nChie: Don't look so sad, Mihono-chan. We might not be able to get the pictures back, but because of you, I've been having lots of fun all day.\r\nChie: All the memories are right here in my heart, so it's fine. Here, raise up your head. We can still make plenty more memories together from now on.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee...\r\nKiyoka: Ahh, the closeness between those two. It kind of makes you feel like tearing up, doesn't it?\r\nSanae: I know. That closeness itself might be the best takeaway from this trip...\r\nYume: Hey, hey, somebody's phone's been ringing. It's ruining the mood. Whose is it?\r\nChie: It isn't mine. ...Hm? Mihono-chan, isn't the ringing coming from behind you?\r\nMihono: Huh? Now that you say it, I think so. But, my phone fell down the cliff...\r\nKiyoka: Wait! Hono-chan, isn't there something in the hood of your parka?\r\nMihono: Whoa-! It's my phone! It didn't fall down the cliff; it fell into my hood.\r\nSanae: I can hardly believe it. But, isn't that great for you, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: Yeah, and it seems like all my photos are safe too. Sorry for making all of you worry, guys!\r\nYume: Good for you. But, wouldn't you normally notice if something fell into your hood, Onee-san?\r\nMihono: I had no idea when it happened...\r\nChie: You might not have been able to notice in the panic after you dropped it. But, I'm glad to see you're back to your happy self, Mihono-chan.\r\nSanae: By the way, your phone has been ringing for a while, hasn't it? Who's trying to get a hold of you?\r\nMihono: Ahhh! Yui sent me all these texts!\r\nKiyoka: \"Where's those lovey dovey shots of you two you promised?\" \"The sun is already setting\" \"Hurry up-!\" it says. Do you have to text her back?\r\nMihono: That reminds me, I did promise I'd send her pictures of Chii-nee and me together.\r\nMihono: But, all I took were normal pictures of us having fun sightseeing, so it's probably not anything like what Yui's expecting.\r\nKiyoka: Fufu, in that case, I'll take one for you now. Hono-chan, hug up nice and close against Setouchi-san. Press your cheeks together too, and it'll look extra lovey dovey!\r\nMihono: I-I can't do that out of nowhere-! It'd be embarrassing, right, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: Well, it is a little embarrassing, but since we are on a big trip, it might be nice to have photos like this too.\r\nMihono: I guess so... Then, when in Rome! [hug-]!\r\nKiyoka: Yeah, that pose looks perfect! I'm taking the picture now. Say cheese!"}, {"paste_key": "hwAEaF86", "title": "misogi chie", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/hwAEaF86", "timestamp": "", "hits": "68", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/ECgV1cc_IOw\r\n[Misogi - Chie: Start] The Torn Ribbon\r\n\r\nAradama: KEEEEEEEEE!\r\nChie: HAAAAAA!\r\nMihono: Alriiight! There's no more aradama around, so I think we're probably done here now!\r\nChie: ...Phew. Good work, everyone.\r\nKiyoka: No, please be on your guard! There's a reading on the spectrum finder!\r\nAradama: KUEEEEEEEE!\r\nChie: Kyah!?\r\nKofuki: I'm taking that aradama-chan!\r\nMirja: ...Musumi Kiyoka, are there any more readings on your spectrum finder?\r\nKiyoka: ...They're all gone. That was honest to goodness the last of them this time.\r\nMihono: Uu~, because I went and said that... Are you okay, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: It seems I was just a little more careless than I should have been.\r\nKofuki: ...Nn? Chichie, you sure about that?\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan?\r\nKofuki: That's not what I mean! It's just, you're acting kinda different than usual...\r\nKiyoka: ...Ah! Your ribbon! Chie-san's ribbon is torn!\r\n\r\nChie: ...Sigh.\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie's usual spirit is gone... Was it that much of a shock to her?\r\nKofuki: Guess even Chichie can get all depressed like that.\r\nKiyoka: It's worrying... Hono-chan, have you ever seen Chie-san like that before?\r\nMihono: Kind of. Way back when, Chii-nee used to cry really easy, and she'd get called crybaby Chii-chan.\r\nKiyoka/Kofuki: Crybaby Chii-chan!?\r\nChie: Just now, I heard the word \"crybaby\"... Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: H-Huh? Was that something I wasn't supposed to tell anyone?\r\nKofuki: Yo! Crybaby Chii-chan!\r\nChie: ...Don't you think you're getting ahead of yourself?\r\nKofuki: Yeah, yeah, that's how it should be. Chichie's gotta be mad if anything.\r\nChie: I can't believe you. I'm feeling fine now, so, this whole... crybaby, thing, just forget about it! Understand?\r\nKiyoka: But, still... That ribbon is important to you, isn't it? It's you and Hono-chan's...\r\nChie: That's right, it's very important to me. But... I can't stay moping around about it forever, can I?\r\nKiyoka: Then... Let us give you a ribbon, as a present! To thank you for always looking after us!\r\nChie: But, I do have other ribbons too... Sorry.\r\nKiyoka: Even if you have more, that's still fine! On the next day we have off, let's go buy one together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Misogi - Chie: End]: Growing Treasures\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Chie-san, how about this ribbon? I think it would look good on you...\r\nChie: I do think it's fine, but... Don't you think it's a little too cute for me?\r\nKofuki: How about this one then? This one's not cute, which is perfect for you.\r\nChie: I'm not sure I like that last part, but... This is nice too. Though, don't you think it's too flashy?\r\nKofuki: You think? This's pretty normal.\r\nKiyoka: I think both of them would suit you fine.\r\nChie: Um... I suppose that's fine then, but...\r\nKofuki: If you've got something you're looking for, then just say it. We can look for one of those.\r\nChie: It's not exactly something I'm looking for, but... I'm so used to wearing my usual ribbon that it's embarrassing trying something else...\r\nKiyoka: But that's such a waste! Since we're here, let's try to get you a new ribbon!\r\nChie: F-Fine then. I'll... give it a try.\r\nKofuki: Still, I wish we had a few more people here to come up with something.\r\nKiyoka: There's no helping it. Hono-chan had something she had to take care of, and the others are all away on missions.\r\nKofuki: Well, no use talking about who's not here, I guess. The two of us'll have to come up with something that'll fit Chichie.\r\n\r\nChie: Thank you for coming out with me today, you two.\r\nChie: But... I'm sorry. In the end, I wound up choosing a ribbon with a design like the one I already had.\r\nKiyoka: Don't worry about that! It was fun picking out a ribbon with you, Chie-san!\r\nKofuki: I mean, if you say that's what you want, then it's fine, right?\r\nKofuki: That's what you're most used to, after all.\r\nChie: Thank you... I'll take good care of it.\r\n\r\nChie: Oh? Who could be stopping by this late?\r\nMihono: Good, you're still up, Chii-nee!\r\nChie: Mihono-chan? Why are you here? I thought you had gone back home today...\r\nMihono: Yeah, I just got back. So anyway-- Here, I got you a present!\r\nChie: ...A ribbon? Don't tell me... When you said you had something to take care of today, you were fixing this...\r\nMihono: Ah, no, that's not it. Actually, when I first got this ribbon, it came in a set of two.\r\nChie: ...It did?\r\nMihono: When you look that surprised about it, it's kinda awkward.\r\nMihono: And anyway, think about it. If you were going to split the same ribbon between two people, wouldn't you normally just buy two of the same ribbon?\r\nChie: That's... true, I suppose. But, if you had this, then... Why did we split one ribbon in two back then?\r\nMihono: I thought, if we did it that way, then you wouldn't forget about me.\r\nChie: ...Of all things. Even if you hadn't done that, you know I could never forget about you.\r\nChie: So then, you went back home to get this?\r\nMihono: Yeah. I'd totally forgotten where I'd left it, so it took me all this time to find.\r\nMihono: But... Chii-nee. This one's also the real ribbon from back then.\r\nMihono: Will you take it?\r\nChie: ...Thank you, Mihono-chan.\r\nChie: The ribbon I got from the others... And this ribbon too, and the torn ribbon as well...

Wait, how are you supposed to do this anyway? Geez-, why doesn't this book explain things right?\r\nYume: Since Yomi-onee-san's birthday is on the 24th, I was gonna surprise her by making a cake without going to Maki-onee-san or Suzuka-onee-san for help, but this is too hard!\r\nYume: I can't tell what it's saying when it's just a book full of recipes-.\r\nMai: Tsubakuro-san? What are you doing in here?\r\nYume: O-Onee-san! That's what I should be asking you; what are you doing here?\r\nMai: I'd thought about making some cookies for Sayaka-chan. These ingredients... Were you baking some sweets too, Tsubakuro-san?\r\nYume: Yeah. I was getting ready for the 24th. I was thinking, after I call everyone over and the party starts, that's when I'll bring out a cake I made myself and really surprise Yomi-onee-san and everyone.\r\nMai: (On the 24th... So a Christmas Eve party. I'm sure that if Tsubakuro-san did make a Christmas cake, everyone in the elite guard would be very surprised.)\r\nMai: If it's alright with you, can we make it together?\r\nYume: You'll do that?\r\nMai: Of course I will. The 24th of December only comes around once a year, so we might as well make a big celebration out of it.\r\nYume: Thanks! Oh, yeah! It'll be a bigger party if there's more people, so can you and your friends all come too?\r\nMai: Can I? I'm glad you asked! Then, let's look forward to the 24th and do all we can to prepare together.\r\n\r\nYume: Wow, I mixed it just like you said to, Onee-san, and now it's looking a lot more like cake batter!\r\nMai: Fufu, you're a quick learner, Tsubakuro-san, so it's fun showing you how it's done.\r\nYume: I'm figuring out what to do with the cake, but we have to get everything else ready too, don't we? Will you help me out with that too, Onee-san?\r\nMai: Of course I will. Since we're going through with this, I want to make it as grand a party as I can!\r\nYume: Hooray-!\r\nMai: Since we've decided on that, I'd like to have more friends helping us with the rest. I'll try asking around.\r\n\r\nMihono: A Christmas Eve party!? That sounds fun! Sure, I'll help!\r\nHiyori: You might be right. It's not a bad idea bringing everyone together at the end of the year to celebrate. I'll lend a hand too.\r\nKaoru: It sounds like too much work, but Ellen gets annoying bugging me to come help. I'll just get it over with and join you.\r\nMai: Thank you, all of you! I'm going to go ask around some more, so I'll meet you in the cooking classroom later.\r\n\r\nYume: Wow, you got all these people to help get the party ready?\r\nMai: Yep, I told them I wanted to throw a big party for the occasion, and they all volunteered.\r\nKofuki: Hey, I didn't volunteer or anything.\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san is here to work as payment for eating Kitora-san's share of pudding. Isn't that right?\r\nMirja: That's correct. I'll have you repay this year's debts before the year is done. Now then, everyone, in order to welcome the 24th as best we can, let's get to work at once.\r\nMihono/Hiyori/Mai: Yeah-!\r\nYume: (I didn't think this many people would come help to celebrate Yomi-onee-san's birthday!)\r\nMai: Tsubakuro-san? Is something the matter?\r\nYume: I-It's nothing. Thanks for bringing everyone here, Onee-san. Let's throw a good party.\r\nMai: Sure!\r\nAnnouncement: Aradama have appeared in the surrounding city, toji are to intercept at once. I repeat--\r\nYume: Aradama!? Geez-, could they have picked a worse time to show up-?\r\nMai: This sure is some bad timing. But still, if we want to make sure everyone can enjoy the party, we should finish our duties first.\r\nYume: Yeah, I'm not letting them stop us no matter what! I'll take them all out in a second!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Two Slightly Off the Same Page\r\n\r\nMai: It's a good thing those aradama were dealt with safely, isn't it.\r\nYume: Yeah. I punished them as good as I could, so hopefully they don't show up anymore...\r\nMai: Hm? By the way, did you see Mihono-chan and the others? Where could they have gone.\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono said she was going to practice her singing, and she took Ban Tsugumi and Shichinosato Kofuki with her to the music room.\r\nYume: (Singing? ...Oh, that makes sense. The happy birthday song is a really important part of birthdays. I'm happy they'd go as far as to practice singing it!)\r\nYume: We can't have the party without singing, after all!\r\nMai: That's true. This will definitely help liven up the party.\r\nMai: (Fufu, a choir singing carols? It's so Christmas-y that I can't wait to hear it! We'll have to get Santa and reindeer themed outfits ready for people too.)\r\nMai: Kitora-san, can I ask you to take care of costumes?\r\nYume: Costumes!? You're going to get stuff like that for the party too?\r\nMirja: Since we're putting on this party, I'd like to do all we can to make it extravagant. I'll go ahead and work on providing the costumes then.\r\nMai: Now it's just the two of us again, Tsubakuro-san. In the meantime, how about we continue working on preparing the cake and feast?\r\nYume: Sure-!\r\nYomi: There you are, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Y-Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYume: (No way, why is she here? What do I do... If she finds out I'm making a cake, the surprise'll be... I need to fool her, but how, umm...)\r\nMai: If you have a moment, Satsuki-san, what sort of Christmas songs do you like?\r\nYume: Huh? Christmas songs?\r\nYomi: None in particular... If I had to say something, I prefer them to have a peaceful melody, as it's calming.\r\nYume: (Oh, I get it! She asked her something totally unrelated to naturally move away from the cake! Onee-san's good at this.)\r\nYomi: That aside, Tsubakuro-san, Yukari-sama is calling for you. Please return to Yukari-sama's quarters at once.\r\nYume: Eh-, do I have to go right now? I'm kind of in the middle of something though...\r\nMai: If the head of the Origami family is calling for you, you'll just have to go. I'll take care of the rest, so you should go see her, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Okaaay. I'm going then.\r\nYume: I'll be back as soon as I can, so you have to keep the surprise a secret from Yomi-onee-san, okay?\r\n\r\nYomi: You look like you're preparing for something. Would you like me to assist you?\r\nMai: (Tsubakuro-san said she wanted to keep the fact that she's making a cake a secret from the elite guard... I know! I'll distract her by asking her to take care of something else.)\r\nMai: Satsuki-san, could you help with getting the feast ready at the kitchen counter over there? We're doing the cooking for a Christmas Eve celebration party.\r\nYomi: I see, so that's what you were preparing for. I understand. If you need celebratory food, red bean rice is a must have.\r\n\r\nYume: I'm baaack~! Wait, huh? Why is Yomi-onee-san doing the cooking!?\r\nMai: Eh? Tsubakuro-san, what's wrong? Why do you look so panicked?\r\nYume: What about you, Onee-san!? Why are you acting so calm about this! I mean, the party on the 24th is for...\r\nAnnouncement: Aradama have appeared, aradama have appeared. Toji are to intercept at once. I repeat--\r\nYume: And why do aradama have to show up now!? Geez-, we have to get things ready as fast as we can!\r\nMai: There's nothing we can do about them appearing this often. Let's all combine our efforts to deal with them again.\r\nYume: Boo-. If I have to then-. Let's go right away then.\r\nYomi: Please wait a moment. There isn't much time left before the 24th, so Tsubakuro-san, please stay here and continue working on the party preparations.\r\nYume: Huh?\r\nYomi: Let's leave, Yanase-san.\r\nMai: Right!\r\nYume: It's Yomi-onee-san's own birthday party, but, asking me to please work on the preparations, she must be super excited for it! Was she always like that?\r\nYume: But, more importantly, the surprise got out! Onee-san couldn't keep her mouth shut~! What should I do now-!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Outcome of the Surprise...\r\n\r\nOn the day of the party.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: As one might expect, after spreading the word to toji throughout the Five Traditions, there's quite a number of people here tonight.\r\nMaki: By the way, I haven't seen Yume anywhere in a while. Do you know where she went?\r\nYomi: If you're looking for Tsubakuro-san, she's shut herself up in the cooking classroom getting things ready for the party.\r\nSuzuka: Yume is cooking? That's rather surprising.\r\n\r\nMai: Tsubakuro-san, I've started decorating the cake, but would you like to do it together with me?\r\nYume: No thanks. There's other things I have to do...\r\nMai: (Tsubakuro-san seems to be in sort of a bad mood, but I wonder why...)\r\nYume: Sigh... It might not be a surprise anymore, but I've gotta at least make a sign that goes on top of the cake...\r\nYume: Uhh, I'll take this big cookie, and write on top with a chocolate pen, \"Happy Birthday, Yomi-onee-san.\" There...\r\nMai: Tsubakuro-san, I've finished decorating the cake, so will you come check how it turned out? I tried making it look a little fancy, but what do you think?\r\nYume: Ehhh!? This is just a Christmas cake!\r\nMai: Eh? Yes... It is a Christmas cake. ...Wait? Tsubakuro-san, what did you write on that cookie...\r\nMai: Wait, don't tell me, is today Satsuki-san's birthday!?\r\nYume: Ehh-!? You helped me out without even knowing that? Didn't I tell you at the start, we're doing a celebration party on the 24th...\r\nYume: Ahhh! Wait, Onee-san, did you think we were doing a party celebrating Christmas Eve!?\r\nMai: I-I did. You mentioned the 24th, so I was sure you meant Christmas Eve...\r\nMai: I see now. So that's why it sometimes felt like we were talking about two different things. I'm sorry, I gave myself the wrong idea, and even had Satsuki-san herself help with it.\r\nYume: No, it's not your fault then. I'm sorry too, for getting upset with you.\r\nMai: It's alright. I feel much better now that that mystery is cleared up. But still, what are we going to do about the cake? I gave it the most Christmas-y decorations I could come up with.\r\nYume: Hmm, there's not a lot of time left, so if we get rid of the Santa decoration and put this cookie on, it'll look a little more like a birthday cake. I'm taking the Santa off.\r\nMai: Wait! Just leave the cookie where it is for now! I just came up with a good idea.\r\nYume: A good idea?\r\nMai: If we take advantage of the situation, we can still surprise Satsuki-san.\r\nYume: Wait, what? What do you mean-? I don't really get it, but this sounds fun!\r\n\r\nMirja: Now, everyone, the Christmas cake you've all been waiting for is ready to be presented! This cake was made with the combined efforts of Tsubakuro Yume and Yanase Mai.\r\nYume: Tadah! Look, look! Me and Onee-san made this cake together!\r\nMai: I only helped with it a little, so first, we'd like for the elite guard to have a taste of the cake Tsubakuro-san made herself.\r\nMaki: Yume made a cake by herself!? I can't believe it.\r\nSuzuka: So this was the big surprise she was excited about. It's very well made.\r\nYomi: Yes, I never would have thought Tsubakuro-san could make such a fine cake. I'm surprised.\r\nYume: Ehehe, you're surprised? But you know, the best part is what's next?\r\nMaki: A blackout!?\r\nYomi: An aradama might be responsible. I'll get my okatana at once...\r\nYume: You don't have to do any of that-. Onee-sans, are you ready? One, two-!\r\nTsugumi/Mihono/Kofuki: Happy birthday to you~. Happy birthday to you~. Happy birthday, dear...\r\nYume: Yomi-onee-san~. Happy birthday to you~.\r\nSuzuka: Oh my, Yomi-san! On top of the Christmas cake, there's a big birthday message!\r\nYomi: Wasn't this a Christmas Eve party today?\r\nYume: Hooray-! The surprise was a big success!\r\nMai: Mmhm! Isn't that great, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nMirja: Thanks to the mixup between Yanase Mai and Tsubakuro Yume, Satsuki Yomi was brought here under the pretense of a Christmas party, and the surprise was highly successful. It may have been accidental, but it played out perfectly.\r\nYomi: Everyone, I'm sorry you had to do all this for my sake. This can be a Christmas party from here on out, so I hope you can enjoy yourselves as you planned...\r\nYume: There's no backing out of it, Yomi-onee-san-. Tonights stars are you and all the Santas, right?\r\nMai: That's right. This is a birthday party and a Christmas Eve party. We have an outfit ready for you too, Satsuki-san. Here, please get changed!\r\nSuzuka: My, and how adorable it is! It would fit Yomi-san perfectly. Eh? You have one for me as well? Come along, Yomi-san, let's get changed.\r\n\r\nMihono: Satsuki-san and them finished changing, so, after the birthday song, our choir is gonna sing Christmas carols!\r\nMirja: Will those of you in reindeer and Santa outfits come forward. Now, let's all have a dance!\r\nYume: Kyahaha-! That Santa outfit looks really good on you, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nMai: She seemed to have no idea, so the surprise was a big success, wasn't it?\r\nYume: Yeah! Onee-san, thanks a bunch. And also, Merry Christmas!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/XL33MXyxw44?t=6708\r\n4: Kanami and Hiyori's Christmas Eve\r\n\r\nKanami: That was a fun party, wasn't it! And you were so cute dressed up like a reindeer, Hiyori-chan. See, look! I took a ton of pictures!\r\nHiyori: Kh, you took so many so fast it's practically a video... What were you even going to do with all these photos?\r\nKanami: You were too cute, so I just had to. Ahh~, I'm having such a good time it's gonna be hard coming back down to reality-.\r\nKanami: I've got it! If we go out around town, the Christmas lights might be up! Hiyori-chan, let's go check it out together.\r\nHiyori: You want to do a walk through the night? Well, that doesn't sound so bad.\r\n\r\nHiyori: There's not a single sign of Christmas down this street.\r\nKanami: Uuuu, who'd have thought even here would still be the same as usual...\r\nKanami: Sorry about this, Hiyori-chan. I made you come out with me and all...\r\nHiyori: You don't have to mind me.\r\nKanami: Still... I thought I'd finally get to enjoy something Christmas-y with you. Uuu...\r\nHiyori: Kanami... Guess I might as well do it now. I was going to leave this by your pillow tomorrow morning, but... Here. This is for you.\r\nKanami: A cute box with a ribbon on it... Hiyori-chan, what is this?\r\nHiyori: Y... Your Christmas present. I had to give something back for all the help you're always giving me.\r\nKanami: Eh-- A Christmas present from Hiyori-chan!? For me? Can I have it? I can really have it?\r\nHiyori: I said it's for you, so just take it already. It might not seem like anything special either...\r\nKanami: No way; I'll be happy no matter what I get from you, Hiyori-chan.\r\nKanami: And, besides...\r\nHiyori: Kanami? What are you looking all flustered for now?\r\nKanami: (I never even thought about a Christmas present. What should I do... Umm, what can I come up with quick at a time like this...)\r\nKanami: Oh, right! I can do that! Let's see, I'll take a notepad and colored marker...\r\nHiyori: What's going on, Kanami? You just started writing a note out of nowhere...\r\nKanami: And done-! Here you go, Hiyori-chan! This is my Christmas present to you! It's a ticket to have a sparring match anytime.\r\nHiyori: Heh...\r\nKanami: Huh? Normally you'd say something to make fun of me there.\r\nHiyori: Go ahead and open the box I gave you.\r\nKanami: What's in it? Umm...\r\nKanami: No way-! It's a handwritten \"We'll have a sparring match whenever you want\" ticket!\r\nKanami: That's crazy! We both thought up the same thing on our own. That kinda makes me happy.\r\nHiyori: I couldn't think of anything Christmas like to give you.\r\nKanami: Then, let's use these and do something Christmas like! Come on, hurry, hurry-!\r\nHiyori: H-Hey, Kanami! Don't grab my hand and start running like that! It's dangerous.\r\n\r\nHiyori: This is...\r\nKanami: Last year, they had this big tree decorated here, so I thought maybe they did it again! It's as pretty as last year...\r\nHiyori: It sure is. I thought that, wherever you go around Christmas, there'd be people everywhere, but there isn't a single person here before us. It's nice and quiet.\r\nKanami: It feels a little strange, doesn't it? Spending Christmas Eve alone together at the place where we first met.\r\nHiyori: Heh... That's true...\r\nKanami: Anyway, let's get right to our match! Are you ready to go, Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: Sure, I'm ready for you anytime.\r\nKanami: (A sparring session all alone with Hiyori-chan, lit under the light of a Christmas tree! This turned into the best Christmas ever.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Maki and Suzuka's Christmas Eve\r\n\r\nMaki: Today was a completely unexpected surprise. What a nice party this was.\r\nSuzuka: It was. It should make for a good report to Yukari-sama. Hm? But where did the star of the night, Yomi-san go off to?\r\nYume: Yomi-onee-san said she was too tired from people celebrating her, so she left as soon as the party was over.\r\nMaki: I see. Then, it's about time we excused ourselves too.\r\nYume: I want to help those onee-sans clean up until the end, so you go back without me, Maki-onee-san, Suzuka-onee-san. I'll see you later.\r\nMaki: It's just you and me now. Why don't we head home?\r\nSuzuka: H-Hang on a moment. Maki-san, it is the night of Christmas Eve, so why not go and see some Christmas lights?\r\nMaki: Christmas lights?\r\nSuzuka: Yes. It's a bit out of the way, but I know of an incredibly beautiful spot.\r\nMaki: Sure, it's not a bad idea to take detours from time to time. Let's go see it together.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Oh my! What a happy accident, that the lights were so much more elaborate than I had thought.\r\nMaki: You were right, it really is beautiful... Though, I didn't expect to see this big a crowd at night in the middle of winter.\r\nMaki: Suzuka, be careful so we don't lose each other...\r\nMaki: And as soon as I said that, she's already gone. Suzuka! Oiii, Suzuka!\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san, what's the matter? You were shouting my name so loudly.\r\nMaki: Well, you just went and vanished on me... With all these people around us, we might get separated again. Here, hold onto my hand.\r\nSuzuka: Eh-- Maki-san...?\r\nMaki: What's wrong, Suzuka? Your face is red.\r\nSuzuka: Th-That's only... It's only because of the reflection of the lights!\r\nMaki: Uh, none of the lights around here are red. Ah-- Don't tell me, did you start catching a cold?\r\nSuzuka: No, that's not the case...\r\nMaki: We can't afford to ignore colds this time of year. Let's check right away to see if you've got a fever. Suzuka, let me see your forehead.\r\nSuzuka: Ma-Maki-san!\r\nSuzuka: (Right in front of all these people...)\r\nMaki: What is it? If you don't hold still, it's hard for me to tell.\r\nSuzuka: ...........................\r\nMaki: Hmm... It feels like you maybe have a little bit of a fever.\r\nMaki: We can't let it get worse, with the night wind blowing on you. Here, I'll lend you my scarf.\r\nSuzuka: No, that won't be necessary. This fever isn't being caused by a cold...\r\nMaki: There's no point in holding back now. Here, I'll wrap you up in it.\r\nMaki: Okay, there you go. We've had our fill of the Christmas lights, so why don't we get you home?\r\nMaki: It looks like the crowds keep going up ahead. Be sure not to let go of my hand.\r\nSuzuka: O-Of course.\r\nMaki: The north winds sure are blowing strong today.\r\nSuzuka: I'm perfectly warm wrapped in your scarf, but are you feeling cold, Maki-san?\r\nMaki: Oh, I'll be fine. I've got the heat of your hand keeping me warm.\r\nSuzuka: Honestly...\r\nSuzuka: (This year's Christmas Eve will be a fine thing to remember. I'll have to offer my gratitude to Santa Claus...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/evNvCiMwU_E\r\n[Xmas' 19 - Tsugumi: Start]: With Our Caroling\r\n\r\nMihono: Wow-! Come take a look! There's so many tasty looking cakes!\r\nKofuki: Whoa! This pudding looks good as hell!\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono, Shichinosato Kofuki, we did not come here today to eat cakes.\r\nTsugumi: We're here to rent choir costumes for the Christmas Eve party, remember?\r\nMihono: Ahh, oh yeah. Sorry about that. The cakes just looked so good I couldn't help it.\r\nTsugumi: You know, you wouldn't think it outside, but this cafe is fairly expansive, isn't it. The interior design has a meticulous feeling to it as well.\r\nMirja: It's meant to be a popular cosplay cafe that allows you to enjoy meals while dressed in costumes specially selected by the cafe owner.\r\nMihono: That sounds fun! Since we're here already, want to have some tea together?\r\nTsugumi: I would love to do that, Asakura-san, but don't you think it would be best to use our spare time practicing singing our carols?\r\nMihono: Oh yeah! We haven't even practiced at all yet, have we. We've gotta back to school as soon as we get the costumes.\r\nKofuki: Geh, it's just a party between friends, so nobody'll care if we phone it in, right?\r\nMirja: That won't do. Shichinosato Kofuki. You have an obligation to entertain the party, as compensation for eating my pudding the other day without asking.\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san, if you don't want to sing, you could always replace Kitora-san's pudding. Though, that pudding was a highly rare limited item. There's no guarantee you'd be able to find another...\r\nKofuki: Tch! Whatever. I'll do it, alright? If that's what it takes, I'm gonna sing my heart out!\r\nCafe Owner: Thank you for waiting. You girls are the choir group that was coming, aren't you? If you're going to be singing at a Christmas party, I think these costumes would be a good fit, but what do you say?\r\nMihono: Whoa-! They're cute! I'd be happy getting to sing wearing something this nice!\r\nTsugumi: From the careful stitching to the elaborate decorations, these are fantastic costumes. Will you really lend something this finely crafted to us free of charge?\r\nMirja: They won't be free, of course. The condition was that we repay them with labor.\r\nKofuki: We've gotta work for it!? Nobody said anything about that-!\r\nTsugumi: Kitora-san, what will we need to do as payment?\r\nMihono: Don't tell me, after the party's over, we'll have to wash dishes here forever...\r\nCafe Owner: Relax, I wouldn't ask for something so severe. What I'd like for you to do is perform your carols here at our shop. How does that sound?\r\nMirja: On the 25th, when we return these costumes, this cafe will be hosting a Christmas event. There, you will wear your costumes and sing carols.\r\nMihono: That's it? That'll be easy then! Right, Fukki?\r\nKofuki: Yeah, I'm glad to hear they're not breaking our backs over it. Singing's no big deal; I can sing as many songs as they want.\r\nMirja: We have an agreement then. On the toji party on the 24th, and here at the cafe event on the 25th, please do your best to liven up both events with your caroling.\r\nMihono/Tsugumi: Okay!\r\n\r\nMihono: Just when we felt like practicing, they told us we can't use the music room. It's too bad, isn't it-.\r\nTsugumi: There's nothing we could do about it. The chorus club is putting in their final preparations for the end of the year choir event.\r\nKofuki: So, where do we start with practicing carols now? \r\nTsugumi: First, to understand what position we're starting from, why don't we sing through our songs?\r\nMihono: Okaaay! Then, I'll put on the background music CD, so let's sing along with it!\r\nMihono/Tsugumi/Kofuki: [singing]\r\nTsugumi: Hmm, I'm sorry to say this, but we don't exactly have the voices of angels, do we.\r\nKofuki: With the two of you going all into falsetto, we weren't getting anywhere near enough volume!\r\nTsugumi: That's true; because we're singing in a different register than usual, we may need to train our throats more.\r\nTsugumi: Ah! I've just thought of something good! Let's move our practice to tomorrow. I'll prepare a special medicine for us by then.\r\nMihono: A-A special medicine!?\r\nKofuki: I've got a real bad feeling about where this is going...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Xmas' 19 - Tsugumi: End]: Harmony Resounding Through the Holy Night\r\n\r\nThe next day.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Thank you for your patience, everyone. Before we begin today's training, please try this throat lozenge.\r\nMihono: Uhh... It's got this weird color I can't really describe. Did you maybe make these yourself, Tsugumi-san...?\r\nTsugumi: That's right. I took ingredients that were said to be good for the throat, ground them to a paste, and kneaded them into corn syrup.\r\nKofuki: There's no way that's going in my mouth, alright!\r\nMihono: I-I practiced real hard by myself yesterday to bring my voice out, so I'll be fine without having to have one of those... Or something.\r\nTsugumi: I see. I was fairly proud of how these turned out too...\r\nYui: [sniff sniff]... Something sweet is in the air... And so I followed my nose, and it led me to a meetup of my sweet honeys! My intuition's super on the mark~!\r\nTsugumi: Yamashiro-san. You came at the perfect time. Would you like to have a snack?\r\nYui: Can I!?  Ah! Are these sweets you made yourself, Tsugumi-san!?\r\nTsugumi: Yes. I tried creating special-made lozenges that were gentle on the throat, but the others said they didn't need them...\r\nYui: In that case, I'll eat them up! Om nom nom...\r\nYui: Wahh-! What's with this!? It's sweet and bitter and sour and burns and it's salty!\r\nYui: The outside is crunchy, but it melts on the inside, and afterwards there's this wave of a fluffy and crackling sensation!\r\nKofuki: What's any of that mean!? I can't even picture the taste!\r\nMihono: Yui, your face turned bright red; are you okay?\r\nYui: Uwah----! I can feel power gushing up in me, and I feel like shouting at the top of my lungs~!\r\nTsugumi: Hmhm, the effects are already showing in such a short timeframe. It seems I can call this highly successful.\r\nYui: Ahh~! I want to shout! Shout my heart out! AHHHH~~~~~~~~~~!\r\nMihono: Sh-She's so loud! Yui's singing is making the windows rattle-! Tsuguki-san's lozenges might actually be amazing!\r\nYui: Whoa; what's going on! I can sing kobushi so well now it's funny~! Give me any enka song and I feel like I could sing it! HAA~~~~~~~~~!\t\t[Kobushi is a technique used in singing enka, where a single syllable is sung while moving between several different notes in succession]\r\nYui: Ahh~! I want to sing out across the sea of Japan! My body's itching to try it~! I can't take it anymore! I'm on my way!\r\nMihono: And she's gone...\r\nTsugumi: She sure is... Though, thanks to Yamashiro-san's sudden appearance, I was able to prove the potency of these lozenges. Now, you two, try some as well!\r\nKofuki: Wait, hold up! I'll give you that they were effective as hell, but wasn't that deep singing voice of hers totally wrong for caroling?\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah, that's right. We're singing carols here, not enka, so maybe practicing on our own efforts is the best way to go...\r\nTsugumi: You think so? I managed to come up with something useful, so it would be a shame not to use them... But, if you both say so, then we can work at it that way.\r\nMihono/Kofuki: Phew...\r\n\r\nDecember 25th.\r\n\r\nMirja: You performed well at yesterday's Christmas Eve party. Now I would like for you to maintain that effort and entertain this venue with your caroling.\r\nTsugumi: Of course.\r\nMirja: Hm? Ban Tsugumi, what's the matter with the two of them?\r\nTsugumi: About that... It might be because the scale of the event is greater than they were expecting, but they seem to be nervous...\r\nKofuki: I-I'm not nervous or anything, y'know. But you're nuts if you think the three of us are gonna liven up all these customers!\r\nMihono: Fukki's right here. Yesterday, all the toji waved lightsticks to pump up the mood, but today we've gotta sing without anything like that...\r\nMirja: It's true that, in these unfamiliar circumstances, I can understand feeling nervous...\r\nTsugumi: For the time being, why don't we let in some fresh air and try to freshen up.\r\nKofuki: Oi! It's gonna be freezing if you open a window!\r\nMihono: Yeah. I'm getting bad enough cold feet as it is...\r\nTsugumi: Ah-- It's... Everyone, please look outside!\r\nKofuki: Whoa, it's snowing! It's pure white out there!\r\nMirja: It's truly a fine white Christmas now.\r\nTsugumi: By pure chance, we now have a fantastic backdrop for our performance. I'm sure we'll be able to carol well again today.\r\nMihono: That's for sure. It'd be a waste to be feeling nervous singing in someplace this romantic looking! Let's have as much fun as we can with it!\r\nTsugumi: Sure. Now then, let's go out. Our choir is taking the stage."}, {"paste_key": "a7kvz73A", "title": "Debug Mission Capriccio", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/a7kvz73A", "timestamp": "", "hits": "285", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/KoaydPNazBE\r\n1: A New Assignment, To the World of VR!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Everyone, thank you for gathering here today to test the new model of training simulator system we have in development.\r\nMirja: The members called for this assignment are... I see. Along with myself, Juujou Hiyori was chosen, as well as the members of the elite guard.\r\nHiyori: Nn? Isn't Kofuki here because she was chosen to be a test pilot too?\r\nKofuki: I'm just an assistant. It's so lame. I wanted to play with computer aradama-chan too...\r\nYume: Hey hey, we just turn this machine on and fight? Are there really going to be aradama inside-? That's amazing~.\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, we came here today as part of our duties, not to enjoy ourselves. Let's only touch the equipment after we've finished hearing their explanation.\r\nMaki: That's right, listen to Yomi. So then, what exactly is it we'll be doing?\r\nTsugumi: As your machine operator today, I'll be the one to go over that with you.\r\nTsugumi: Those of you who have been selected as test pilots will be entering the VR world and looking to find bugs; what's known as debugging work.\r\nTsugumi: While you fight enemies and explore the virtual environment inside the simulation, please collect bugs whenever you find them. Those of us operating the machine on the outside will then work to correct them.\r\nTsugumi: Now then, I'll move right on to explaining how to operate your devices. Have you all finished putting them on?\r\nMirja: These are fairly well made, considering how lightweight they are. The way we'll be able to train with these without it weighing down on us is intriguing.\r\nYume: I'm all ready to go too-! Will there be a whole bunch of strong enemies coming out? I can't wait to see~.\r\nYomi: I've finished preparations as well. Being given this mission, I will see it through to completion. I'll be in your care.\r\nTsugumi: If you're ready, let's go over the basic commands in accordance to the manual.\r\nKofuki: Oi, hold up a minute-. Looks like somebody's too tech stupid to have even turned the thing on-.\r\nMaki: Kh, what's going on with this? There's so many buttons I can't tell what's what...\r\nYume: Geez-, are you okay over there, Maki-onee-san?\r\nHiyori: Heh, looks like Shidou Maki has an unexpected weak side.\r\nMirja: You say that, Juujou Hiyori, but you aren't operating it correctly either. To recover bugs, you're meant to press and hold this button...\r\nHiyori: I-I know that! \r\nTsugumi: I see, simplification of the device's interface. This seems like it needs to be improved on as well. I'll make a note of it.\r\nKofuki: Damnit, aren't you having all the fun, huh! Ahh, I wanna fight aradama-chan in there too-! Why didn't they pick me for this?\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san! Please be careful waving your arms and legs around by where those cables are bunched together. It's dangerous.\r\nKofuki: I've got too much energy and boredom built up in me that I don't know what to do with it all-. Aghhh-----!\r\nKofuki: Nn? Something got knocked down. Huh, it's just a keyboard...\r\nTsugumi: Sh-Shichinosato-san! What do you think you're doing? Honestly... It's too dangerous for you to be there, so please move away from the machine.\r\nTsugumi: It seems everyone's preparations are in order by now. Then, I wish you all the best of luck. Take care.\r\n\r\nHiyori: So this is the world of VR... It's built up pretty nicely, isn't it? It looks just like the real world.\r\nMaki: They're here already! Virtual aradama. Why don't we see what they're made of! TAAAAAAAAH!\r\nMaki: The feeling of cutting through them is just the same as the real thing. This place really is well put together.\r\nYume: Ah-, they're coming this way too! Here I go-! EEEIIII!\r\nYume: Ahaha, you're right~! It's super well made!\r\nYomi: Agreed. It's good that their movements in combat remain the same as well.\r\nHiyori: It looks like we've wiped out one pack of aradama for now, but... ...? There's some kind of strange presence...\r\nMaki: The ground's shaking? It's like a group of something is coming at us from far away, but what is it?\r\nMirja: There wasn't any sort of enemy like this in the explanation Ban Tsugumi gave us...\r\nYomi: Then that would mean, we've found our first bug, haven't we.\r\nYume: It feels like something crazy's coming our way. I'm getting excited!\r\nHiyori: Even in a virtual environment, if enemies appear, all we need to do is destroy them! Let's go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Discovered a Bug Well Beyond Expectations!?\r\n\r\nYume: Ahaha, what's with this, it's crazy! Isn't this weird-! Can I really beat them up too?\r\nMirja: Regardless of their appearance, they came to attack us, so we should eliminate them as enemies. HAAAAAH!\r\nHiyori: TAAAA-!\r\nHiyori: [Pant, pant]... I beat them all over here too, but... Nobody said we'd fight something this ridiculous!\r\nYomi: Given how unexpected it is, it's highly likely this is a bug. There may be many of them, but we'll need to defeat them quickly and report it back to the research lab.\r\nYomi: HAAAAAH!\r\n\r\nMaki: Phew. Looks like we've finally cleared them all out. Good work everyone, handling one battle after another.\r\nHiyori: It's good we took care of things, but... What's with those ridiculous enemies that came in at the end? Whose idea of a joke was that!?\r\nMaki: I didn't expect to face anything that bizarre in here either. Let's report this back straight away.\r\nMirja: Then, as we practiced before, everyone please enter the command to return to the real world.\r\n\r\nYume: We're back-! Ahh, that was a lot of fun.\r\nYomi: The first investigation has been completed, and the debugger team has now returned.\r\nTsugumi: Welcome back. How was the world of VR, everyone?\r\nHiyori: It was really well designed, but... What was with those joke enemies?\r\nTsugumi: Joke enemies? What do you mean?\r\nHiyori: A huge group of Kofukis came out of nowhere and attacked us.\r\nKofuki: Huhh?\r\nTsugumi: Ah-- Don't tell me, because of what Shichinosato-san did with the keyboard earlier...\r\nKofuki: Huh!? As if that could've...\r\nTsugumi: At any rate, it's certainly an unexpected bug. Please tell me about it in greater detail.\r\nYume: A whooole bunch of enemies who looked just like onee-san here came after us-!\r\nYomi: This is just an estimation from what I saw, but there were at least around 500 of them.\r\nMirja: No, speaking more precisely, there were 777 Shichinosato Kofukis.\t\t[There's a 7 in Shichinosato]\r\nKofuki: Where'd you even pull a number that specific from!\r\nMirja: I only confirmed it with my observational ability...\r\nTsugumi: Measurements made with Kitora-san's kantougan... That should be accurate then.\r\nMirja: What could have caused these bugs exactly...?\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san could never have the skills needed to create a system advanced enough to intentionally produce bugs.\r\nKofuki: Oi! Are you just taking the opportunity to diss me? Whatever, just hurry up and get the bugs so you'll know it wasn't me. Hear that, Maki-senpai?\r\nMaki: ...\r\nKofuki: Nn? Maki-senpai's device is still on, and she's not moving!\r\nMirja: Ah-! Could it be, she was unable to exit from VR? Ban Tsugumi, can you detect any errors in the system?\r\nTsugumi: Hmm, what could this be... There seems to be a malicious program mixed in with the ones we made...\r\nYomi: Does that mean... This was someone's act of tampering?\r\nYume: No way... Then, somebody trapped Maki-onee-san inside the VR world!?\r\nKofuki: Th-That wasn't me! Quit acting like I'm a suspect for all this weird stuff already!\r\nTsugumi: You have nothing to worry about. This complex program isn't something you could have made by accident. Though, this is going to require a more detailed analysis.\r\nMirja: Whether it's a simple malfunction, or an act of sabotage, we'll need to recover more bugs to make absolutely sure.\r\nTsugumi: That's right. To rescue the stranded Shidou-san as well, it would be a great help if you would return to the VR world at once...\r\nHiyori: You don't have to beat around the bush in an emergency, Tsugumi! Let's go back into the VR world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Even More Bugs!?\r\n\r\nMaki: HAAAAAH! YAAAH---!\r\nMirja: There's Shidou Maki, fighting on her own.\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san! Heeey! We came to get you-.\r\nMaki: Yume! And the rest of you too! So you came back. I didn't know what to do when I was only one who couldn't get out.\r\nYume: Did you maybe forget how to work the machine?\r\nMaki: I thought I did it just how they told me...\r\nYomi: That aside, you seem to be very exhausted...\r\nMaki: Yeah. It seems that, after I was left behind, the fighting here would just keep going on forever. I started worrying my stamina wouldn't hold out.\r\nHiyori: There's more aradama-! Shidou Maki, leave all this to us! TAAAAAAAAAA--!\r\nYume: I'll do it too-! EII----!\r\n\r\nMirja: We seem to have defeated them. I managed to recover several bugs just while we were fighting, so why don't we return for now?\r\nYume: Don't screw it up this time, Maki-onee-san.\r\nMaki: Right, this time for sure. Let's go back, everyone!\r\n\r\nMirja: The debugger team has returned. ...Nn? Shidou Maki is...\r\nMaki: ...\r\nYomi: Unfortunately, she seems to have once more been unable to return. She isn't moving at all.\r\nTsugumi: So it still turned out like this... Actually, after analyzing the bugs you recovered, we found signs that a very malicious virus could have infected the system...\r\nMirja: A virus? Who could have done that, and why...\r\nRichard Friedman: Hey, you must be Ban Tsugumi-kun. Sorry to keep you waiting.\r\nTsugumi: Hello. Thank you for sparing some time for us, Doctor.\r\nFriedman: You don't have to be so formal with me. We've been investigating the phenomenon over here too, but it looks like you were somehow infected with a nasty virus.\r\nFriedman: It seems right to consider a bug created by this virus as the cause of your friend being unable to return from VR.\r\nTsugumi: So it's like that after all...\u3000Then, to go about removing this harmful bug...\r\nYume: This is too complicated for me to keep up with, but what's going to happen to Maki-onee-san?\r\nYomi: Shidou-san is fairly exhausted, and has taken injuries as well. What would happen in the worst case scenario, if someone was gravely wounded in the simulation?\r\nFriedman: Hmm, this is the first time a case like this has happened, so I can't say for certain... But, if she remains unable to return, in the worst case scenario, I can't deny that her life may be in danger.\r\nTsugumi: But, then...\r\nTsugumi: Five people were planned to fight in this test, so the training enemies were fine tuned to match the strength of five people. If Shidou-san fights endlessly against that on her own...\r\nYomi: Even Shidou-san would be in danger. We have to return to Shidou-san and offer her backup at once...\r\nYume: Yeah, it's just like Yomi-onee-san says! We can't leave Maki-onee-san alone in someplace that dangerous!\r\nMirja: Everyone... Shidou Maki may not be alone after all...\r\nKofuki: Nn? What do you mean, Mirja...\r\nKofuki: Wait, seriously...? Hiyori! Oi, Hiyori, say something, c'mon!\r\nHiyori: ...\r\nTsugumi: Now even Juujou-san is trapped in the virtual world...\r\nYume: We've gotta save both of them, fast! What should we do?\r\nTsugumi: To bring them both back to the real world, we'll need to find and analyze all these malicious bugs as soon as possible, as well as identify what was responsible for creating them.\r\nMirja: Which means, we have no choice but to go back inside. Tsubakuro Yume, Satsuki Yomi, do you have any objections?\r\nYomi: I don't. This is our mission.\r\nYume: I'll do all I can to save Maki-onee-san! So I'm going!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Who's Behind All This!?\r\n\r\nMaki: Still more... [pant... pant...] TAAAAAAAHH!\r\nHiyori: [pant... pant...]  Alright, I can see the end of them. This'll finish it-! YAAAAAHH!\r\nYomi: Shidou-san, Juujou-san. Sorry to keep you waiting.\r\nMaki: You all came back in!\r\nYume: Hey, Maki-onee-san, you're hurt! Are you feeling okay?\r\nMaki: I couldn't help it, with this many successive battles...\r\nMirja: Juujou Hiyori, you're injured as well. Can you manage?\r\nHiyori: It's fine; this is my fault for not being able to exit anyway. I could have sworn I entered the command properly, but...\r\nMirja: No, this wasn't caused by either of you mishandling the controls. It seems to be caused by a malicious bug someone engineered. Right now, Ban Tsugumi and the others are working as fast as they can to look into the bugs, but...\r\nMaki: So that's why. Then, that means we should hurry and record all the bugs we can find, to help them figure out what's causing this.\r\nYume: More showed up! You onee-sans back away! I'll take care of this myself! HAAAAAHH!\r\n\r\nMirja: We've managed to recover quite a number of bugs again this time. It would be good if all of us could return together now...\r\nHiyori: Right, this time for sure... Here we go.\r\n\r\nYomi: The debugger team has now returned. Sigh, as expected, Shidou-san and Juujou-san still aren't moving.\r\nTsugumi: Good work. While you all were fighting, we split our efforts with Dr. Friedman to fix the bugs, and no new people were stranded, but...\r\nTsugumi: The bug preventing those two from returning seems to still be operating somewhere...\r\nYume: Why are those two the only ones who can't come back!? They're already all beat up and could get beaten any time now! Do something about it-!\r\nFriedman: Really, who could have thrown such a nasty wrench in our works... Though I suppose we don't have time for me to complain now. We'll work as fast as we can to correct the bugs for the time being...\r\nMirja: Is there anything more we can do to be of help?\r\nKofuki: What if you helped out like I am?\r\nYomi: Shichinosato-san, why exactly are you waving that fan at the machine?\r\nKofuki: I'm fanning it so it won't overheat. But is this really even doing anything?\r\nMirja: I suppose it's better than nothing...\r\nYume: Hey hey, if we beat a whole bunch of enemies and collect the bugs, it might help save them, won't it? Then let's go back inside again!\r\nYomi: That's right, I'm also worried about whether their stamina will last. We can't simply stand here doing nothing but waiting.\r\nFriedman: I'd appreciate it if you did that, in order to rescue those two as quickly as possible, but...\r\nTsugumi: The risks have grown much greater...\r\nMirja: Risks? What do you mean?\r\nKofuki: Oi, isn't this getting real bad here? The server's burning up so hot I can't even touch it!\r\nFriedman: That's not good. The machine is overloading from the great amount of bug fixes being rapidly enforced, and it's started building up heat.\r\nTsugumi: If the load on the server continues building like this, and it crashes, we'll be unable to recover it. Sending all of you back in under these circumstances could mean...\r\nYume: You want us to leave Maki-onee-san behind then? I'm not doing that!\r\nYomi: Is there any way to resolve this situation...\r\nMirja: ....................................! I've come up with a strategy I'd like to attempt. Dr. Friedman, would it be possible for this to work?\r\nFriedman: I see, that's a rather ingenious plan you've come up with. Kitora-kun, could you stay behind to oversee it?\r\nMirja: Ordinarily I would agree to that, but, if I remain here, our fighting strength on the other side will...\r\nKofuki: That just means it's finally my turn to step up! You should swap with me if that's how it is!\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki, this is not a foolproof strategy. This is a dangerous operation that could risk everything for success. Is that really alright with you?\r\nKofuki: You're damn right it is-! I've been itching for a fight so bad I can't sit still over here!\r\nKofuki: C'mon Yomi-senpai, Yume, as soon as you're ready, get in here! I'm going in!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: A Big Operation to Risk it All!\r\n\r\nMaki: Kh, the aradama started multiplying all of a sudden. Juujou Hiyori, can you manage?\r\nHiyori: You're pretty beat up yourself, Shidou Maki. Since it's come to this, I'll...\r\nKofuki: Nahhh, I'll handle things from here!\r\nHiyori: Kofuki! What are you doing here?\r\nKofuki: If I get to play with some aradama-chan, I'll go through hell or VR!\r\nYume: We're here too! You two should get behind us! Here we go-!\r\nKofuki: ORAORAORAAAAA! This's nowhere near enough! Just keep it coming!\r\nHiyori: Oi! Don't go saying unlucky things like that! A huge number of aradama are pouring out...\r\nYomi: With this number of enemies... Fighting with all of us, including the wound covered Shidou-san and Juujou-san could be too difficult...\r\nKofuki: What, you're chickening out? It's just at a time like this that we've gotta go do that plan of ours! Oiii, you guys, it's your turn now-!!\r\nMaki: You guys...?\r\nKofuki: ORYAA----!\r\nKofuki: Out of my way, those're my aradama-chan~!\r\nKofuki: I love you, aradama-chan!\r\nHiyori: Wh-What!? The 777 Kofukis are still showing up!?\r\nMaki: Damn, to have more enemies to handle now... ...Nn? Wait, hold on, they're acting strange.\r\nKofuki: Alllright, all 777 of me! Go out like that and slaughter up some aradama-chan!\r\nHiyori: The 777 Kofukis are actually following the original's orders and destroying the aradama!?\r\n\r\nYomi: It seems they've managed to defeat all of the aradama. Good work, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: You don't have to thank me. I got to have crazy fun doing this.\r\nHiyori: Still, why did the bugged enemy Kofukis start fighting on our side?\r\nKofuki: It's cause of Mirja's strategy.\r\nYomi: The 777 Shichinosato-sans made by Shichinosato-san's prank were reprogrammed to become our allies. It was an all or nothing strategy, but it greatly paid off.\r\nYume: We rounded up all the bugs too, so we should all be able to come back to the real world now. Make sure you do it right this time, Onee-sans.\r\nMaki: Right, I'll do what I can. Here goes!\r\n\r\nMaki: Ohhh! I made it back! I safely made it back to the real world!\r\nHiyori: Yeah, we really did come back this time. ...What a relief.\r\nTsugumi: Shidou-san, Juujou-san, it's good to see you two safe and sound. All of you, please, get some rest.\r\n\r\nMirja: Hello, Dr. Friedman? How did it go?\r\nFriedman: From the sound of things, they just caught the culprit who slipped the bugs in.\r\nShidou: Ultimately, who were they, and what were they after...\r\nFriedman: From analyzing the bugs you recovered, we determined the one responsible was a software engineer from a rival systems development company.\r\nFriedman: The police also wanted to thank you for all your efforts collecting those bugs, which gave them the clues needed to catch the culprit.\r\nHiyori: Really? I'm glad we could be of some help then.\r\nMaki: So, the fact that we couldn't return from VR wasn't because we made any mistakes after all...\r\nTsugumi: I hate to break this to you, but that's not exactly true. We determined the bug the rival company had created was only set to trigger after someone improperly entered the commands...\r\nMaki/Hiyori: Huh!?\r\nMirja: In other words, the great number of bugs were created when Shidou Maki and Juujou Hiyori made mistakes with their devices, which ultimately led to the culprit being arrested.\r\nMaki: What!? So my mistake caused this after all...\r\nYume: Well, it's fine. They got to catch the bad guy because of you.\r\nYomi: That's right, this case was resolved as a result of Shidou-san and Juujou-san's mechanical ineptitude.\r\nHiyori: Kh... Even though they're thanking us, it's a complicated feeling...\r\nKofuki: Anyway, isn't this a case of all's well that ends well? I got to have my fill of the fun too, so fix that thing up already and let me play with it some more!\r\nTsugumi: You seem to be the only one eager about that, Shichinosato-san.\r\nMirja: That's right. While it's a relief that the issue was safely resolved, it will take time to make the system ready for practical use.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/AuF8ZqOvA9Y\r\n[VRS Equipment - Maki: Start]: Just to Be Sure\r\n\r\nYume: Found you, Maki-onee-san!\r\nMaki: Yume, what do you need? I thought you had the day off today.\r\nYume: Don't you have it off too, Maki-onee-san? Hey hey-, since we have free time, don't you want to play a game together?\r\nMaki: A game?\r\nYume: Some toji onee-sans made a VR game in their lab, and people are saying it's super fun.\r\nMaki: VR... I think I'll have to turn you down this time.\r\nYume: Ehh, you should go-. They said it's really easy to play too, so you'll be fine even though you're dumb with technology, Maki-onee-san.\r\nMaki: I-I wasn't worried about that...\r\nSuzuka: Then, Maki-san, since you have this opportunity on your day off, why not go and play with Yume?\r\nMaki: ...Doesn't seem like I have much of a choice. If you don't mind me acting as a chaperone, then I'll go.\r\nYume: Yaay! I get to go out with Maki-onee-san! That makes me happy. Let's get going then-!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: I'm surprised to see two of the elite guard arrive. It might be unexpected, but I'm glad you're here. I'll have two stations ready for you right away.\r\nMaki: Hang on a minute, I'm only here to chaperone her.\r\nYume: Ehh-, but we're already here, so you should just do it too, Maki-onee-san-!\r\nMaki: But...\r\nTsugumi: If you're concerned with the safety of it, you have nothing to worry about. Fighting within the game should be safer than your ordinary battles with aradama.\r\nMaki: Well, I can't argue with that...\r\nTsugumi: By the way, we're currently hosting an event. Whoever can score highest in the battle stage will be given a prize of cream puffs from a popular store.\r\nYume: Ahh! That's that store Suzuka-onee-san loves, isn't it! Hey hey, Maki-onee-san, if you win, then won't Suzuka-onee-san be really happy?\r\nYume: You should play for Suzuka-onee-san too-.\r\nMaki: ...I guess, if I have to. Fine, if I'm doing this, then I'll aim for the top!\r\nYume: Hooray-! Let's try our best, Maki-onee-san!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: There, now everything is ready... Hm? Shidou-san, why are you holding your okatana?\r\nMaki: Since I'm going to a strange world fighting unknown enemies, I want to take every precaution.\r\nTsugumi: I see. Though, in this game, you'll be battling with laser guns, so your okatana won't be necessary... But, if it gives you peace of mind, that's okay.\r\nTsugumi: Now then, let's start the game. Take care.\r\n\r\nYume: Wow-! So this is the game world! The city's all pretty and shiny!\r\nYume: Let's go on the roof of that building! Juuump!\r\nMaki: Yume, wait for me! Okay, I'll do it too... EII!\r\nMaki: This is amazing! The game world improved our jumping ability by this much. I can leap from building to building like I were using hachimanriki.\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san! Let's go up to the top of that tower!\r\nMaki: Sure, let's go!\r\nMaki: Ahh, the city skyline at night really is beautiful. I wish Suzuka and them could be here to see this...\r\nMaki: ...Huh? Yume? Yume, where did you go?\r\nMaki: We must have gotten separated while I was looking at the skyline.\r\nMaki: Heeey, Yume! Where are you? If you're hiding, then say something! Yume-!\r\nMaki: ...No use. She's not responding. Ban Tsugumi said it was safe here, but it's still too dangerous to explore an unknown world on your own.\r\nMaki: I need to calm down and deal with the situation. At times like this, you need to...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[VRS Equipment - Maki: End]: What Suits Me Best\r\n\r\nMaki: Heeey, Yume! Where did you go? Say something back. Yume-!\r\nMaki: Hm, that sound. The battle stage must be starting. If I follow the enemies, maybe I'll join up with Yume. I'll focus on the battle for now.\r\nMaki: If I remember right, the command to bring out the laser gun was... Okay, I got it. Now I just point it at the enemies on the opposite building...\r\nMaki: Kh, why can't I pull the trigger!? The command to pull the trigger was...\r\nMaki: Ah-- While I was working with it, the enemies got right in front of me! Damn, how should I...\r\nMaki: Ah--! That's right, I still have that, don't I! It might be tasteless of me to use my okatana in the game, but...\r\nMaki: Here I come! SERYAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nMaki: Good! I can defeat them with my okatana too. I'll keep this up and wipe them out! HAAAAAAHH!\r\nYume: Ehh-- Hey, Maki-onee-san?\r\nMaki: Yume! That's good, you're safe! I'll finish them all off in a minute! HAAAAAAHH!\r\nYume: Come on-, Maki-onee-san! It's a game, so fight with your laser gun already-.\r\nMaki: An okatana seems to be what suits me best after all. Alright, this should finish them! YAAAAAAHH!\r\nMaki: Alright, battle stage clear. Good work, Yume.\r\nYume: I wasn't working at all-. You beat them all by yourself out of nowhere, Maki-onee-san.\r\nMaki: I see, sorry about that. Anyway, how about we enjoy a look around the city now?\r\nYume: Okay!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Welcome back. Did you two have a good time?\r\nYume: Yeah! Maki-onee-san beat everything in the battle stage first, so I didn't get to do anything, but it was a lot of fun jumping around between the buildings-.\r\nMaki: It was. The virtual world was more detailed than I imagined, and it was satisfying seeing every nook and cranny of the city.\r\nTsugumi: That's good to hear. Now then, as all challengers have finished their runs, the results of the battle stage will now be revealed.\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san beat them all straight away, so there's no way she didn't take first place!\r\nMaki: That's right, I got serious hoping for that. Let's see the rankings.\r\n\r\nMaki: What!? We came in last place!?\r\nYume: Eh-!? But why? We should've been first in beating the most enemies and beating them fastest. Why are we last-?\r\nTsugumi: At first, I was just as perplexed as to why you two didn't earn any points in the battle...\r\nMirja: When investigating the cause, we came to the conclusion that there was a problem with how you defeated the enemies.\r\nTsugumi: Did you use something besides the laser gun to defeat them?\r\nMaki: Kh... So you don't get any points for defeating them with okatana...\r\n\r\nYume: We're back-!\r\nMaki: ...\r\nSuzuka: Welcome back, the two of you. Oh, Maki-san, what's the matter? That's an awfully gloomy look on your face.\r\nYume: You still can't get over that we lost, Maki-onee-san? Cheer up, okay-.\r\nMaki: Th-That's not it. It's just... I planned on coming back with Suzuka's favorite cream puffs, but instead...\r\nSuzuka: Well now, is that why you're in such low spirits. Fufu. Maki-san, please lift up your head.\r\nSuzuka: I would be happy to have those cream puffs, but your feelings alone are enough to satisfy me.\r\nMaki: Suzuka...\r\nSuzuka: Next time, I'd like for all of us to go play that game together.\r\nMaki: Right, sure thing. By that time, I'll master my way around a laser gun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Q19Fa9VDWgg\r\n[VRS Equipment - Yume: Start]: Nothing to It but to Do It!\r\n\r\nMaki: [mumble mumble mumble]... \r\nYume: Geez, Maki-onee-san, how long're you going to keep reading the instructions for? \r\nMaki: Just give me a bit more time, Yume. I want to thoroughly drill myself on all the game commands, just in case a bug occurs in the game world.\r\nTsugumi: Shidou-san, I understand why you might feel unsure of using cutting edge technology, but I can assure you, this VR game Kitora-san and I helped to develop is perfectly safe. You have nothing to worry about.\r\nYume: That's right-, they say it's popular with other toji onee-sans too, so it's fine.\r\nMaki: Still, since they say it's an action shooting game, there's no way to avoid battling enemies, is there? If worse comes to worst, and I end up losing with a weapon I'm not used to...\r\nYume: Come on-, you take everything way too seriously, Maki-onee-san-.\r\nTsugumi: I have to agree. There is a battle stage in this VR game, but exploring the city is the main objective, so that won't be an issue.\r\nYume: See, this onee-san's saying the same thing. Let's get started already-.\r\nMaki: Just hang on! Only another 20 pages and I'll have finished the manual...\r\nYume: With these things, it's easy to just learn while playing-. Isn't it, Onee-san?\r\nTsugumi: I believe that everyone learns in different ways. Tsubakuro-san, if you're ever in trouble, please ask Shidou-san for the commands.\r\nYume: Okaaay! Maki-onee-san, as soon as you're ready, we're going in!\r\n\r\nYume: Wow-! Look, look! The city's all sparkly and pretty-. Ah, there's something up on the roof of that building! Let's go check it out!\r\nMaki: Hey, Yume! Wait for me! You can't run off on your own!\r\nYume: Ahaha! This is funnn! I know! Let's climb up to the top of that really high building! Hurry up, Maki-onee-san-!\r\nMaki: Hold on, I'll be right there! ...You know, while we're here, this world is incredible. We can jump ten times higher than usual. We got to the top of a high rise building in no time.\r\nYume: Ahh! There's a helicopter parked on the roof of the next building over! Think I can jump to there?\r\nMaki: Oi, hold it, Yume! Even here, a jump that far is going to be...\r\nMaki: Err... What was the long distance jump command...\r\nYume: I don't believe it-! Maki-onee-san, you even brought the instruction manual in here?\r\nMaki: There's times when we'll need to have it handy. Just hold on, Yume, I'm checking over the commands now...\r\nYume: Don't worry, it's easy peasy!  Here I gooo-! Juuump!\r\nMaki: Ahh-- Yume!\r\nYume: See, look! I jumped to this roof just fine-! You come too, Maki-onee-san-.\r\nMaki: Whoa! What's with the strength of this wind!? It'll be tough reaching there through this.\r\nMaki: I'll go after it dies down. Oiii, Yume, just to be sure, find somewhere safe to get out of the wind.\r\nYume: I'll be fine-. See, if I go all the way into the corner of the roof, I can get a really pretty view of the city at night down bel...\r\nYume: Wah----!\r\nMaki: Yume!\r\nYume: No way! I'm falling!?\r\nYume: Uhh, when this happens, what was I supposed to do? What do I do, Maki-onee-san!? I'm gonna fall all the way down!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[VRS Equipment - Yume: End]: Seriousness Pays Off\r\n\r\nMaki: Yume! Are you okay!? Yume-!!\r\nYume: Wahhh, what should I do!

I'll take us down slowly, so don't leave my arms.\r\nYume: Okay, thanks... Wait, what! Maki-onee-san, you're flying!? How? How-?\r\nMaki: In this game world, there's a command to fly through the air.\r\nYume: Ehhh!? Nobody told me that-!\r\nMaki: It was written in the instruction manual. You should have read it.\r\nYume: Boo-. Instead of reading that big book, it seemed like it'd be faster learning by trying it yourself-.\r\nMaki: Sure, even if you memorize the manual, if you can't handle the controls when the time comes, there wasn't much point.\r\nYume: Still, it's because you took reading it so seriously that you saved me. Thanks.\r\n\r\nMaki: Here, Yume. We've landed safely.\r\nYume: Ahh~, thank goodness! \r\nYume: Hey hey, teach me how to fly in the sky too!\r\nMaki: Of course; it'd be dangerous if this happened again, after all. Watch me closely. You do this...\r\nYume: Okay, okay, like this?\r\nYume: Whoa-, that's crazy! I'm flying too!\r\nMaki: You're a natural, Yume. Just after seeing that complicated command one time, you already memorized it.\r\nYume: Hey hey, since I can fly now and all, well, I'm going to fly up to the top of the highest building!\r\nMaki: It does seem pretty high up there. Though, while we're in this world, we might as well enjoy it.\r\n\r\nYume: Wow-, it's super high up here on the roof! You can see all the night lights in the city-.\r\nMaki: Oi, Yume! If you walk on the edge of the building, you're going to fall like before!\r\nYume: I'm fine, I'm fine! Cause I can fly now! See, look!\r\nYume: Wawawa, I'm falling-!\r\nMaki: Yume! Did you lose your footing again!?\r\nYume: Just kidding! I'm fine; I remember how to fly, okay.\r\nMaki: Hey, Yume! Don't tease me like that...\r\nYume: Still, it's really amazing that you can do this here too!

Ah, it's finished! Phew... Carving out a pumpkin is easier than it seems, isn't it?\r\nMirja: It may be hard on the outside, but it isn't so difficult to cut with a knife.\r\nKiyoka: Come to think of it, why do we use pumpkins anyway?\r\nMirja: About pumpkin lanterns-- Halloween is thought to have originated with the ancient Celts, and is largely based on a certain legend.\r\nMirja: That is, the lingering spirits of sinners who were unable to pass on would wander the land carrying lanterns carved from turnips.\r\nMirja: It seems that at some point, people who had emigrated to America began carving pumpkins into lanterns in place of turnips.\r\nMirja: As it goes, these Jack O'lanterns are said to drive off evil spirits and welcome in kind ones.\r\nKiyoka: Lingering spirits... It's kind of scary to think about, but if they drive off evil spirits, then that's a bit of a relief.\r\nKiyoka: And I just can't wait to put on cute costumes and makeup with everyone for Halloween.\r\nSanae: You're giving it your all to get things ready for the Halloween party, aren't you, Musumi-san.\r\nKiyoka: I am! Have you decided which costumes you're going to wear yet, Iwakura-san, Juujou-san?\r\nSanae: Well, I was thinking it over. But I'm not so sure yet.\r\nHiyori: ...I haven't gotten anything yet. Anyway, Halloween has become completely natural in Japan now, hasn't it.\r\nMirja: It has. Even theme parks seem to be holding special limited time Halloween events.\r\nSanae: Hmm. That sounds like it could be neat to try too.\r\nMirja: If you have the opportunity, you should go and see one.\r\nMirja: Now then, why don't we bring things to a stopping point here and continue the rest of the preparations tomorrow?\r\nKiyoka: Good idea.\r\nKiyoka: I know! While we're having dinner, we can think over what Juujou-san should do for her costume!\r\nKiyoka: We should be able to rent costumes too, so I think it would be alright to come up with a list of ideas first!\r\nSanae: Sure! That sounds like a plan.\r\nHiyori: Not you too, Iwakura-san... Me in a costume, it's just...\r\nSanae: Well, we don't have to do any more than think about it, okay? I'm sure it'll be fun.\r\n\r\nThat night... Kiyoka and the others received an urgent dispatch to an abandoned factory.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: When I got the call to come here in the middle of the night, I didn't expect there to be so many other people...\r\nMirja: It could be that these aradama were recognized as enough of a menace to warrant it.\r\nMaki: Thank you for responding to our summons despite the late hour.\r\nMaki: The aradama that appeared here seem to have some strange characteristics. \r\nMaki: After a recent reading we picked up, we've decided to take immediate action now.\r\nSanae: Shidou-senpai? What do you mean when you say these aradama are strange?\r\nMaki: Even though they appears on spectrum finders, they can't be seen in person... Or so it seems.\u3000We thought it might be an equipment malfunction at first, but it's been happening too often here.\r\nSayaka: It's like there's ghosts.\r\nKiyoka: Even though Halloween is close, a real ghost would be a little...\r\nHiyori: That's right... Something like ghosts couldn't actually be here.\r\nKanami: Still, it feels like there really could be one here, in a place like this.\r\nKiyoka: ...!? I was trying not to think about that...\r\nKanami: Whoops, sorry. Anyway, we should beat these aradama as soon as we find them.\r\nSanae: I think that's the best course of action too.\r\nMaki: Let's first look for them using our spectrum finders. Contact everyone the moment you detect anything. Now, let's get to work!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: (We've been walking all over since then... But there's no signs of aradama at all. Are they really even here...?)\r\nKiyoka: And... I feel like we've been walking in circles this whole time. Don't you think so, Juujou-san?\r\nKiyoka: Huh? Juujou-san?\r\nMirja: Is something wrong?\r\nKiyoka: Juujou-san was right with me until a minute ago, and now she's gone...\r\nMirja: Did she go to search someplace else? Still, to do so without informing anyone... What do you think about this, Etou Kanami?\r\nMirja: Etou Kanami?\r\nKiyoka: ...Eh, Etou-san's gone too!?\r\nKiyoka: What if it isn't an aradama after all, but there's something else here...\r\nMirja: Don't allow your nerves to get the better of you, Musumi Kiy--\r\nKiyoka: B-But... We've been walking in circles this whole time...! And now Juujou-san and Etou-san disappeared--\r\nKiyoka: ...KYAAAAAAA!

It looks kind of like one of Renpu's research labs, but... It's too dark in here.\r\nKiyoka: Oh right, where's Mirja-san!? Mirja-saaan!\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nKiyoka: Ah, my phone!\r\nKiyoka: ...There's no service. ...Am I completely on my own?\r\nKiyoka: No, there has to be somebody nearby...! Shidou-saaan! Iwakura-saaan...! Juujou-saaan...\r\nKiyoka: ...I-I'll just take a quick look around. Though, it's scary... It is scary.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Hya... Did something just move!? There was some kind of faint light...\r\nKiyoka: Like a Jack O'lantern... almost.\r\nKiyoka: It couldn't be... a lingering spirit, could it?\r\n???: ...Aaa....a.\r\nKiyoka: Wh-What... was that!?\r\nKiyoka: Is there actually an invisible aradama here!?\r\nKiyoka: Wait, on the ground here, these are... Glasses?\r\nKiyoka: These are just like Mirja-san's.\r\nKiyoka: They aren't very dirty either... That has to be it. If her glasses are here, she must be nearby... Maybe the others too.\r\nKiyoka: If they fell down like I did, they might be hurt...\r\nKiyoka: If they are, then I have to help them! It's a little intimidating... But Musumi Kiyoka won't give up here!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Okay... The ones here are just normal aradama. If it's just these... I can manage.\r\n???: ...Aaa...a.\r\nKiyoka: There it is... That weird sound again. What's making it?\r\nKiyoka: Juujou-san and Iwakura-san! Ahh... I'm so glad to see you. I finally found you.\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nSanae: ......\r\nKiyoka: I defeated some aradama, but I'm still detecting more of them. And, since I got separated from Mirja-san and everyone...\r\nKiyoka: ? Is something the matter?\r\nHiyori: Kiyokaa...?\r\nKiyoka: Yes? I'm here now...?\r\nSanae: Kiyokaa...\r\nKiyoka: Could you please stop talking in that weird voice? Also, is it me, or are you covered in sweat?\r\nKiyoka: Actually, it's more like... Y-Y... Y-Y-You're!? You're melting!!!????\r\nTwo Aradama:  Kiyoka...a!\r\nKiyoka: ...KYAAAAAAAA!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: [pant, pant]... Juujou-san, Iwakura-san... They turned into aradama. Uuu... I just don't know what's going on anymore...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: If You're the Real One... Then Answer This!\r\n\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nSanae: Juujou-san, are you hurt anywhere? \r\nHiyori: No, I'm fine. Still, what is this place? Weren't we supposed to be looking for aradama in an abandoned factory?\r\nSanae: We were... This seems to be an unused research facility though.\r\nSanae: Ah! There's an aradama's signal over that way.\r\nHiyori: We should check it out.\r\n\r\nKanami: ......\r\nSanae: Look! Etou-san is over there fighting! Let's back her up!\r\nHiyori: So you're okay then, Kanami. Good thing we found you so soon.\r\nKanami: ......\r\nHiyori: Kanami?\r\nKanami: ...Kanami?\r\nSanae: Something's not right about her... Back up, Juujou-san!\r\nKanami: [sizzle, sizzle sizzle]...\r\nAradama: Ki...ki... SHAAAA!\r\nHiyori: What the... Kanami turned into an aradama!?\r\nSanae: Is this the strange aradama Shidou-senpai told us about!?\r\nHiyori: Insulting Kanami by disguising as her like that... Prepare yourself!\r\n\r\nHiyori: What wass the deal with that, anyway...\r\nSanae: If aradama could go up to people looking like their friends, a lot of people are going to get hurt... Hopefully that's something only the aradama here can do.\r\nHiyori: Right. We've got to destroy these aradama and find the others.\r\nVoice: ...I-Is someone over there?\r\nHiyori: That voice...\r\nKiyoka: WAH-!? Y-You again!?\r\nKiyoka: Are you... the real Juujou-san and Iwakura-san?\r\nHiyori: I'm the real one!\r\nKiyoka: I-If you are, then... What foods are rich in soy isoflavones!?\r\nHiyori: Tofu and natto. Here, I'll make sure you're real too. At our last meeti... Or anyway, who was absent last time? If you are the real Kiyoka, you should be able to answer that.\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan and Kofuki-san. Hono-chan went shopping with Chie-san. Kofuki-san was suppressing aradama with Tsugumi-san.\r\nHiyori: No doubt about it; it really is you.\r\nKiyoka: Ahh, I wanted to see you two so badly... Juujou-san, Iwakura-san!\r\nSanae: Um... You believe we're the real ones for now, don't you, Musumi-san?\r\nKiyoka: Ah, yes, of course I do. A little while ago, I found aradama that looked just like you two... It's all so confusing.\r\nSanae: Us too, we just saw Etou-san change into an aradama...\r\nKiyoka: They started melting all of a sudden... I was so scared on my own...!\r\nHiyori: It's not something anyone'd be comfortable seeing, is it...\r\nSanae: If the three of us stick together, you should be able to get some peace of mind, Musumi-san. Let's hurry and find the others.\r\nKiyoka: Okay!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Don't Turn Into an Aradama...\r\n\r\nAradama: ......\r\nKanami: I guess they're the same as the ordinary aradama we fight after all?\r\nMirja: That seems to be the case. I didn't notice any major differences between them.\r\nHiyori: That Kanami and Mirja just destroyed an aradama. It should be safe to treat them like they're real.\r\nKiyoka: No... We have to be careful here! I have Mirja-san's glasses with me, but she's still wearing them... That's a little suspicious!\r\nHiyori: In that case... It'd be best to ask them things only the real ones could know.\r\nSanae: We have to make absolutely sure. Okay, let's call out to them.\r\nHiyori: Kanami!\r\nKanami: Wah!? What are you shouting for, Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: What was the present I gave you for your birthday?\r\nKanami: Natto over rice, and homemade nimono! It was extra tasty!\r\nSanae: ...Eh!?\r\nSanae: (...She gave natto over rice as a birthday present?)\r\nHiyori: Alright, that confirms it... You're the real Kanami!\r\nKanami: C'mon, you're so weird, Hiyori-chan.\r\nKiyoka: Um... I think these are your glasses, Mirja-san.\r\nMirja: Thank you very much, Musumi Kiyoka. I was using a spare pair after I lost these.\r\nKiyoka: A spare pair!? Then that means, you're the real Mirja-san, aren't you!\r\nMirja: Juujou Hiyori had the same thing to say about Etou Kanami. Did something happen to you three?\r\nSanae: Well, you'll never believe this, but...\r\n\r\nMirja: I see. So that's what happened.\r\nSayaka: Kanami and Mirja... Everyone's here.\r\nMaki: I was a bit anxious when I found myself in an unfamiliar place with nobody else around, but we can now finish our original mission.\r\nKiyoka: Iwakura-san, Iwakura-san, do you know anything we can do to confirm if that's the real Shidou-san?\r\nSanae: (I think it's fine, or at least, I feel like that's the real Shidou-senpai, but...)\r\nMaki: What is it?\r\nSanae: Um... Shidou-senpai, this question might sound strange, but, when we first met, do you remember what we spoke about?\r\nMaki: Of course. We talked about personal strength, didn't we? That was a good chance for reflection for me too.\r\nSanae: I'm glad to hear it; that you remembered.\r\nHiyori: What could we ask Sayaka...\r\nKanami: Hey, Sayaka-chan! Will you have a sparring session with me real quick? It's very important right now!\r\nSayaka: I don't really understand, but okay.\r\n\r\nMaki: An aradama that imitates a human form. That sounds like trouble... Though I never ran into one myself.\r\nKanami: Oh yeah, you said there was an aradama that looked like me, wasn't there? Was it about the same as me when it came to swordfighting too?\r\nHiyori: Kanami. ...You're not about to say you wished you could have fought it, are you?\r\nKanami: You really get me, Hiyori-chan. But, I was only thinking that a little. \r\nSayaka: Look... The aradama grouped up.\r\nMaki: Even if they try looking like us, they're still a sorry sight. Let's beat them down fast!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Even if it's Halloween, I Don't Want Any Mischief!\r\n\r\nSayaka: The aradama have all been defeated. There aren't any more readings.\r\nHiyori: We didn't see any more aradama looking like people after that... But what even were they?\r\nKiyoka: I'm not exactly sure, but... It's better that we didn't see any more. I'd rather forget I ever saw them...\r\nHiyori: Well, I guess there's no point in us worrying about it.\r\nSomeone's Voice: Anybody-, is anybody there-?\r\nKiyoka: Eek... Did you hear that strange voice just now!?\r\nTsugumi: Ah, there is someone there. This is Ban Tsugumi. Please tell me if all of you are together.\r\nTsugumi: I can guide you through an escape route this way up to the surface-.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: It seems like you safely defeated the aradama. I didn't expect any less from you all. By the way, did you find the strange aradama from the rumors?\r\nKiyoka: It was so hard on us... Everyone disappeared all of a sudden, and, before I knew it, we were somehow underground...\r\nKiyoka: When I was alone, I thought I found other people... But they changed into aradama...! It was scary like you wouldn't believe...\r\nTsugumi: I see. This factory, and the research laboratory underneath it, have a bit of a shady history...\r\nTsugumi: Before its closure, there were common reports of researchers abruptly losing consciousness. And, after its closure, there were signs of aradama on spectrum finders, but they couldn't be found in person. It's a highly interesting case.\r\nKiyoka: ...I wish they'd tell us things like that before we got sent on our mission!\r\nTsugumi: This factory itself has been abandoned for a long time, so maybe it wasn't considered that important.\r\nKiyoka: I wish this had all been settled before I became a toji then...\r\nMaki: Though, Musumi Kiyoka. Because of how quickly we acted, the aradama causing this issue were dealt with. So, don't you think things should be settled here now?\r\nTsugumi: That's right. Thanks to all of you, I think that should be the last of the strange happenings here.\r\nKiyoka: Speaking of strange, why did we end up in that underground lab anyway?\r\nKiyoka: I remember feeling like I was falling down, but when I looked up at the ceiling, there weren't any holes I could have fallen through...?\r\nEveryone There: ............\r\nTsugumi: I'm not quite sure about that now, but, hmm. What if we think about it like this?\r\nTsugumi: How about, the aradama decided to get up to some mischief for Halloween?\r\nKanami: That's a little too out there... Right?\r\nHiyori: As if something like an aradama could have fun with Halloween.\r\nTsugumi: Fufu, I was only joking of course.\r\nTsugumi: I would have greatly liked to have seen the aradama you found here. If only I'd gone along with you from the beginning.\r\nKiyoka: You look happy just hearing about an unusual aradama...\r\nKiyoka: With Tsugumi-san acting so much like her usual self, it's almost like everything that happened was like a dream.\r\nMirja: In that case, why don't we all return home now? We'll need to continue our preparations for Halloween tomorrow.\r\nKiyoka: That's right! We also have the important job left of deciding on Juujou-san's Halloween costume.\r\nHiyori: Didn't I tell you... I said I didn't need one.\r\nKanami: Wait, that sounds like fun! What would Hiyori-chan look best in-?\r\nSanae: So many things would look good on Juujou-san that it's hard to rule any out.\r\nKanami: I know what you mean!\r\nHiyori: Know what what means? And anyway, don't get started on this here.\r\nMaki: They're a real noisy bunch, aren't they.\r\nMirja: Agreed. Though, it's fine to let them go on like this sometimes.\r\nMaki: Well, you're not wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/HT3YdcAAc3c\r\n[Halloween 19 - Sayaka: Start]: A Request Offer\r\n\r\nMirja: I've been looking for you, Itomi Sayaka. Do you remember the director from that historical film?\r\nSayaka: I remember.\r\nMirja: As it turns out, that director has sent in another offer. He requested you, myself, and Iwakura Sanae.\r\nSayaka: I didn't plan on being in any more movies after that.\r\nMirja: That may be so, but, those at the top... Or rather, the public relations department is fairly eager to accept this.\r\nMirja: I understand how you feel, but is there any way you could lend us your assistance?\r\nSayaka: ...I'll do it if it's just a little.\r\nMirja: Thank you very much. I think they'll be able to meet that expectation of yours.\r\nMirja: The role you will be playing is that of a younger nun under my guidance, so you shouldn't need to say many lines.\r\nMirja: Now then, why don't we go visit Iwakura Sanae.\r\n\r\nSanae: Eh, you want me to be in a movie with you and Itomi-san? I'll be in a movie!?\r\nMirja: It's only natural to be surprised. However, this too is a part of our duties as toji.\r\nSanae: But, can I really do something like that...?\r\nSayaka: We'll do our best together.\r\nSanae: Itomi-san. It's amazing how you can be totally calm here.\r\nSayaka: This is the second time for me. And also, this is an important mission.\r\nSanae: That's true. This will be my first time acting, but I'll do it as best as I can.\r\nMirja: According to the project outline and the script, it should be a horror action film.\r\nMirja: The plot features a pair of young nuns who go to exterminate a centuries old black cat demon living in a ruined mansion.\r\nSayaka: I'll be playing the younger nun.\r\nSanae: Then that means, I'm the one who's playing the black cat demon?\r\nMirja: Yes. I'm not sure exactly why you were chosen for the part, but that director is one to set his heart on something and not let go.\r\nSayaka: I think you'll be a cute black cat.\r\nSanae: But it's a horror movie... Is that really okay?\r\nMirja: That shouldn't be an issue. Judging from the photos of costumes that they sent us, they don't look designed to be scary.\r\nSayaka: They're cute.\r\nSanae: The nun clothes have a stylish feeling to them. I bet they'd look good on you two.\r\nMirja: Before the filming takes place, I plan to hold rehearsal sessions and briefing sessions with the director when there's time between missions.\r\nMirja: Aradama suppression will be my highest priority of course, but I'll make my efforts here as well.\r\nSayaka: Mm. We should make the best use of our experience and bearing as toji.\r\nMirja: Much like with their offer with the historical film, they must be expecting a similar kind of action from us.\r\nSanae: In that case, I think I might be able to do some of it.\r\nSayaka: Don't worry. I know you can do it, Sanae.\r\nSanae: Alright, thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Halloween 19 - Sayaka: End]: The Scream is Vital...?\r\n\r\nOn the day of the film shoot.\r\n\r\nSayaka: I only need to walk around the ruined mansion looking for the rumored black cat demon?\r\nFilm Director: Yes, that's right. There's a few lines for you to say, but the most important part is the scream.\r\nSayaka: ...The scream?\r\nFilm Director: In this scene, just before you climb the ladder to the next floor, you see the shadow of the black cat, and I want you to scream as loud as you can.\r\nFilm Director: This is your big scene. A scream is the heart of horror-- It's the most thrilling part. So I'm counting on you.\r\nSayaka: I understand... I'll do my best.\r\nFilm Director: Sure, sure. I can already tell I made the right call requesting you three! Anyway, we'll talk later.\r\nSanae: Your big scene is a screaming scene... Doing a scream on purpose... It'll be a little tough, won't it?\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nSayaka: I've never really screamed before.\r\nMirja: Then, why not do some practicing? Say, \"Gyaa-\".\r\nSayaka: Gyaa-.\r\nSayaka: ...Like that?\r\nSanae: Wouldn't it be better to sound a little more shocked when you do it?\r\nMirja: That's reasonable advice to give.\r\nSayaka: Gyaa-!\r\nSayaka: ...How was that?\r\nMirja: Hmm... Instead of sounding so rough, something like, \"Kyaa-!\"... It may be better to make it sound cuter like that.\r\nSayaka: I think I'm starting to get it. Thank you, both of you.\r\nStaff: Itomi-san, if you could head over here around now~.\r\n\r\nThe apprentice nun visited the ruined mansion to search for the black cat in question, but... Along the way, she became separated from her senior nun.\r\n\r\nSayaka: ...Sister, where are you?\r\nSayaka: And... Where is the black cat demon too...\r\nSayaka: (When I climb up this ladder... I scream... I have to yell... Kyaa-. I have to sound... as surprised as I can.)\r\nThe Voice of a Cat?: Nyaa~.\r\nSayaka: (...Okay. Now I--)\r\nSayaka: --KYAAAAA...!\r\n\r\nStaff: Alright, we'll be taking an hour break now-.\r\nSayaka: Good work.\r\nMirja: You did well yourself, Itomi Sayaka.\r\nSayaka: You two still have more scenes. You have to rest before then.\r\nSanae: Then, should we get right to having lunch? I'm a little excited to see the catering.\r\nSayaka: Mm, I feel hungry too. It's smelled good for a while here.\r\nMirja: Fufu, you're right about that. Let's go see what they have then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/HguM1_W3fqw\r\n[Halloween 19 - Sanae: Start]: I'm a Bakeneko\r\n\r\nHiyori: You're going to be starring in a movie?\r\nSanae: I-I am.\r\nSanae: Umm, do you remember when Itomi-san was a stuntman for a movie that one time?\r\nSanae: It sounds like the staff from that movie made another request, and it was decided that I would be helping them together with Itomi-san and Kitora-san.\r\nHiyori: They probably picked Sayaka because of last time, but why were you chosen for this?\r\nSanae: I think it's because I fit their image for the part? My hair's naturally wavy.\r\nHiyori: Well, your hair does kind of have a life of its own... But what does that have to do with it?\r\nSanae: It has a lot to do with it! After all, the part I'm playing is a bakeneko, a cat demon! See, doesn't it look sort of catlike?\r\nHiyori: That's what you mean?\r\nHiyori: I've worn a catgirl costume before too, but my hair's like this.\r\nSanae: You were so cute back then, Juujou-san! You were all, \"I'm a catgirl, nya-!\"\r\nHiyori: I-I wasn't getting that into it!\r\nSanae: Huh, weren't you?\r\nHiyori: I was not!\r\nHiyori: Leaving that aside, so you'll be playing a bakeneko, huh... What kind of movie is it?\r\nSanae: It's a horror movie with action elements. I'm going to be fighting against Kitora-san.\r\nHiyori: Action between Iwakura-san and Mirja... It sounds like it'll be a great movie.\r\nSanae: You think so?\r\nSanae: This is my first time doing something like a movie... To tell the truth, I'm a little nervous.\r\nHiyori: Everybody goes through their first time at some point. Besides, knowing you, you'll play the bakeneko part with all you've got, right?\r\nHiyori: I think you'll be fine.\r\nSanae: ...Thank you! I'll give it everything I've got!\r\nHiyori: Sure. Anyway, when are they doing the filming?\r\nSanae: That would be... On Halloween day.\r\nHiyori: ...Oh. So then you won't be there with me on Halloween.\r\nSanae: That's what I regret most about this...\r\nSanae: I really wanted to see you in your vampire costume...\r\nHiyori: You don't have to be that depressed about it. You can still see it, like in pictures.\r\nSanae: That sounds perfect! You have to send me pictures, okay! I want to see shots of you and Etou-san together!\r\nHiyori: Why do they have to be me with Kanami!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Halloween 19 - Sanae: End]: On to the Filming!\r\n\r\nThe day of the film shoot.\r\n\r\nSanae: The weather doesn't look too good, does it.\r\nMirja: That's true, Iwakura Sanae. However, for a horror film, this might actually be considered good weather.\r\nSanae: Ah, you have a point there.\r\nSanae: But, all the same... They really are going to start filming, aren't they. I wonder if I can do this right...\r\nMirja: Are you feeling nervous?\r\nSanae: Extremely nervous!\r\nSanae: Itomi-san, what was it like for you the last time you did this?\r\nSayaka: What was it like?\r\nSanae: Did you feel nervous at all, and things like that. I need to use you for reference!\r\nSayaka: For reference...\r\nMirja: Is something the matter with that?\r\nSayaka: I don't know what to do, if you say you want to use me for reference... ...I don't really remember last time.\r\nSanae: Eh-!? You don't remember it!?\r\nSayaka: I just moved like they told me to, and then it was over before I noticed. That's why I think it'll go fine this time too.\r\nSanae: Sh-She's a real big shot...\r\nStaff: It's showtime-. Iwakura-san and Kitora-san, please stand by for your scene-.\r\nSanae: I-It's already starting!?\r\nSayaka: You can do it, Sanae.\r\nSanae: Y-Yeah... I'll do what I can!\r\n\r\nSanae: ...[gulp]\r\nSanae: (Right now, Kitora-san will be coming up from the first floor, so I have to frighten her...)\r\nMirja: I-Is somebody there?\r\nSanae: (Ahh, I'm so nervous I can't stop myself from smiling...! I have to stiffen up my face some more...!)\r\nMirja: [pant, pant]...\r\nSanae: (Mirja-san's raising the sense of tension... She's a good actor...)\r\nSanae: (I-I'll have to try and keep up with her performance... One, two, and three...!)\r\nSanae: UNYAAAAAA!\r\nMirja: KYAAAAAAAAA!\r\n\r\nStaff: Okay, that's a wrap-.\r\nSanae: Ahh, that was so nervewracking...\r\nMirja: You did well, Iwakura Sanae. That was a good performance.\r\nSanae: Thanks a lot, Kitora-san! I can't wait for it to be in theaters!\r\nMirja: I understand the feeling. When that time comes, let's go and see it together.\r\nSanae: Sure!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Y6ff2yewfcQ\r\n[Halloween 19 - Mirja: Start]: Kaiju Mirja?\r\n\r\nYui: Mirja-san, are you going to be debuting on the silver screen!?\r\nMirja: Calm yourself, Yamashiro Yui. Do you remember before, when Itomi Sayaka appeared in that film?\r\nKofuki: Oh yeah, that happened, didn't it. It was that time with the historical drama thing, right?\r\nYui: If you mean that, I remember it too! Sayaka-chan was extra cute back then, wasn't she!\r\nMirja: It seems the director from then has made another offer.\r\nYui: So they've had their eyes on Mirja-san ever since then... They sure know their stuff.\r\nKofuki: What's she talking about now.\r\nMirja: No, that isn't entirely wrong... It seems that, somehow, they remember me from then, and made an offer.\r\nYui: See!\r\nKofuki: What're you looking all smug for!\r\nYui: Anyway, I'm 100% going to go see it, Mirja-san! I'll see it 7 million 7 hundred and 70 thousand times!\r\nYui: Actually, when are they filming it! I want to go watch!\r\nMirja: On Halloween day.\r\nYui: Halloween day!?\r\nYui: That's when I was supposed to go with Kanami-chan and them to their Halloween event...\r\nYui: Gununu... Do I go see Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan in their costumes, or do I go see Mirja-san...\r\nMirja: I should mention, along with myself, Itomi Sayaka and Iwakura Sanae will also be performing.\r\nYui: Sayaka-chan and Sanae-san too!? B-Both of them are hard to pass up...\r\nKofuki: You're making a pretty funny face now, y'know?\r\nYui: How can I choose though!\r\nMirja: No matter how much you puzzle over it, I won't bring you with me. This is work.\r\nYui: I understand...\r\nYui: I'll wait with bated breath to see the precious sight of Mirja-san when the movie opens, and prioritize the event where I'll only have one chance to see Kanami-chan and everyone!\r\nMirja: That isn't what I meant... Though, if you can accept that, then it's fine.\r\nKofuki: Well, if that's how it is, then you'd better get your body in shape for it.\r\nKofuki: Here, eat these niboshi. Want some milk with that too?\r\nMirja: ...Why niboshi and milk?\r\nKofuki: If they're asking for you, it's cause they want you to play a kaiju, right? You've gotta be at least two meters for it then.\r\nMirja: Of course I wouldn't receive an offer to play a kaiju. ...I will be playing a nun.\r\nKofuki: A nun? That'll be a laugh.\r\nYui: That's not true! She'd look just perfect as one!\r\nKofuki: Well, either way, give it your best shot. I'll be looking forward to it.\r\nMirja: ...Yes, I'll make every effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Halloween 19 - Mirja: End]: Sister Mirja!\r\n\r\nOn the day of filming.\r\n\r\nSanae: We finally have to perform... It's nervewracking. I-I think I should check over the script one more time...\r\nMirja: Will you be alright, Iwakura Sanae?\r\nSanae: Ah, Kitora-san... Since this is my first time doing something like this, I'm so nervous my hands won't stop shaking...\r\nMirja: Nervousness brought on by apprehension?\r\nMirja: Though, knowing you, you must have prepared extensively in advance, didn't you?\r\nSanae: I did; I made sure to practice, and I memorized how to say all my lines right!\r\nMirja: In that case, there should be nothing for you to worry about. You'll do just fine.\r\nSanae: Thank you, Kitora-san... But, if I don't double check, I'll be too nervous...\r\nSayaka: ...The script.\r\nSanae: Th-Thanks, Itomi-san!\r\nStaff: We're starting-. Iwakura-san, Kitora-san, please be ready to go-.\r\nSanae: Ah... L-Let's get going!\r\nMirja: Are you not going to check the script?\r\nSanae: No, I'll be okay even if I don't.\r\nMirja: (Her trembling has stopped. Is she the type who grows stronger when it comes time to act?)\r\nMirja: Let's go, Iwakura Sanae.\r\nSanae: Yes!\r\n\r\nStaff: Alright now... Ready-, start!\r\n\r\nMirja: That sound... From upstairs...?\r\nMirja: (...Suspcious of the sounds coming from the second floor, I go to investigate. When I climb the to top of the stairs, next comes...)\r\nMirja: KYAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nSanae: Ahahahaha! For you to be so shocked, my mischief was a big sucess nya!\r\nMirja: J-Just what are you!\r\nSanae: What am I? Just a plain old cat, nya.\r\nMirja: You demon cat... I-I'll destroy you here!\r\nSanae: You can go ahead and try, nya!\r\nMirja: (Iwakura Sanae comes rushing in... I fight back with the candlestick I'm holding.)\r\nSanae: Unyaa!?\r\nMirja: It's afraid of the flames...? Then!\r\nMirja: (Throwing the candlestick, while she's frightened by the flames, I take the knife I had hidden...!)\r\nSanae: UNYAAAAAAAAAA!! I'LL REMEMBER THIS, NYAAAAA!!\r\nMirja: ... It ran away? ...What is happening in this mansion...?\r\nStaff: Okaaay, that's good.\r\n\r\nMirja: Phew, nicely done, Iwakura Sanae. Thanks to your performance, we were able to make a fine action scene.\r\nSanae: Not at all! It's because of you, Mirja-san, that I think I was able to act so well!\r\nMirja: Then, why don't we say it's because of the both of us?\r\nSanae: Alright! Ahh... Now that that's over, I'm feeling kind of hungry.\r\nMirja: In that case, once Itomi Sayaka's scene is finished, how about we go to eat together?\r\nSanae: Sure thing! There's a delicious mizusawa udon place close by!\r\nMirja: Mizusawa udon is the udon of Gunma, isn't it? This isn't Gunma, though?\r\nSanae: I looked it up beforehand, thinking it could come in handy!\r\nMirja: I-I see...\r\nMirja: (What exactly was she expecting to need it for... Though, Iwakura Sanae seems to be happy about it... Well, there's no harm in it.)\r\nMirja: Then, I'll be looking forward to it.\r\nSanae: Sure! Please do!"}, {"paste_key": "f7PCSabY", "title": "misogi yui + shinsengumi sayaka", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/f7PCSabY", "timestamp": "", "hits": "81", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/pR7T3znqc5E\r\n[Misogi - Yui: Start]: A Different Possibility\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Good work, Yamashiro-san. That's all I need from you for today.\r\nYui: Wait, are you sure?\r\nTsugumi: Yes. I need to set some aside for Shichinosato-san, after all.\r\nYui: Tsugumi-san, the way you look out for Kofuki-san... It's so precious I can't get enough!\r\nTsugumi: Only you could describe aradama management as precious, Yamashiro-san.\r\nTsugumi: The reason I do this is because, if there are no aradama around, Shichinosato-san starts to get cranky.\r\nYui: Oh come onnn, isn't that what makes it so precious~? Or, are you saying you get it?\r\nTsugumi: Hmm, I can just never tell how you'll respond to anything.\r\nTsugumi: There's many types of people among the investigation team that I'm unused to dealing with, but... Yamashiro-san, you're the most extreme of them all.\r\nTsugumi: Socializing is hardly my strong suit, but there's no one I've ever had as much trouble understanding as you.\r\nYui: That sounds like an incredible appraisal of me, doesn't it!?\r\nYui: If that's how you feel, then please go ahead and learn more about me! Read me like an open book; I'll answer any question you ask!\r\nTsugumi: Ah... Then, I have one question. I realize it's a little late to ask, but, why are you helping with my research?\r\nYui: Putting it bluntly, I'm doing it for the money.\r\nYui: I get to be together with a real beauty, and I get paid to do it. Working as a toji is seriously the best job there is!\r\nTsugumi: Your expression was different before and after you said that... Was there something about it you found hard to tell me?\r\nYui: Ahaha, not at all; I love a girl who's perceptive like that.\r\nYui: ...My little sister, she's sick. That's why I need as much money as I can get.\r\nYui: But, don't you think a reason like that's sort of too heavy to bring up? I mean, when you're fooling around with girls, it's best to keep things a little lighthearted and all!\r\nTsugumi: She's sick?\r\nYui: Ahaha, I shouldn't have told you all that. Please just forget it.\r\nTsugumi: No, it's good that I was able to see a new side of you.\r\nTsugumi: And also, Yamashiro-san. The experiments you're assisting us with... Their results might one day be linked to a cure for your little sister.\r\nYui: Will they really!?\r\nTsugumi: Speaking confidentially... Research is progressing on whether or not noro can be used to cure diseases.\r\nTsugumi: In fact, there have been rumors of a successful test case...\r\nYui: This research can... But, how does it work?\r\nTsugumi: It's only a rumor, so I'm not very clear on the details. At most, it should still only be at the fundamental research stage.\r\nYui: But still! It's possible that it could save my sister... It might be able to save Miku, wouldn't it?\r\nYui: ...Hearing something like that, there's no way I can sit still about it!\r\nTsugumi: Then... You might want to go and ask the elite guard about it.\r\nYui: The elite guard?\r\nTsugumi: Yukari-sama herself is involved with this research, so the people in the elite guard may know something more.\r\nTsugumi: Though, it's considered top secret, so I'm not sure if they will tell you...\r\nYui: That's enough for me! I'm going now!\r\n\r\nYui: The elite guard...\r\nYui: I guess I'll ask Suzuka-san, since she's from Ayanokouji Martial Arts School too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Misogi - Yui: End]: Things Are Best the Way They Are!\r\n\r\nYui: Hello! Is Suzuka-san home at the moment!\r\nSuzuka: ...This isn't my home, I'll have you know. Was there something you needed?\r\nYui: Actually, there's something I wanted to talk to you about...\r\nSuzuka: If it's a love confession, I'll refrain from hearing it.\r\nYui: You mean, somebody leaked my private information about how I love Suzuka-san!?\r\nSuzuka: Well now, was that actually true?\r\nYui: Ahh, so you were just kidding with me. Here I was getting rejected before I even asked you out.\r\nSuzuka: Don't you think it's your conduct that causes you to be treated this way? So? What was it you really came to see me about?\r\nYui: ...Do you think we could talk about this someplace else?\r\nSuzuka: It seems this is a rather serious conversation. ...Come with me.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: You won't have to worry about us being overheard in here.\r\nYui: Thank you very much! To tell the truth... I heard there were experiments in treating people's illnesses with noro, and I wanted to ask you if, maybe you knew anything about it... Or something.\r\nSuzuka: --!? Where did you hear about... No. More importantly, why do you want to know?\r\nYui: Actually... Umm, this is kind of hard for me to say, but...\r\nSuzuka: ...It's about your sister, isn't it.\r\nYui: You know about her?\r\nSuzuka: It's only natural we would gather that much information. You haven't spoken to anyone else about this... Have you?\r\nYui: N-No! As soon as I heard about it, I came right here...\r\nSuzuka: In that case, forget all about it.\r\nYui: ...! B-But, they're researching it, aren't they!?\r\nSuzuka: When you have no way of knowing how long it will take before that research can be used for practical purposes, there's no point in placing your hopes on it, is there?\r\nSuzuka: Your sister is desperately fighting to overcome her illness with modern medical care, and should be gradually getting better.\r\nYui: ...\r\nSuzuka: If you have any time at all to spare speaking about this with me, you should spend it visiting her instead.\r\nSuzuka: And, you can forget all about that research. I'm sure that... Even if that method could make her better, you would only come to regret it.\r\n\r\nYui: (...What Suzuka-san said is right. But, still...)\r\nYui: (If it can make her better, no matter what method it takes, I just want her to be healthy again...)\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui!\r\nYui: Eh?\r\nAradama: KEEHHHHHH!\r\nYui: Uwah!?\r\nMirja: HAAAAAH!!\r\nYui: Th-Thanks for that...\r\nMirja: ...You aren't acting like your usual self, Yamashiro Yui.\r\nMirja: What is it you're brooding over? Isn't your cheeriness your greatest asset?\r\nYui: ...I'm sorry.\r\nMirja: If something is bothering you, why not speak about it? Telling someone else may lead to you finding the means to resolve it.\r\nYui: Then... I heard they're researching a new kind of treatment that might cure my sister. But, someone who knows a lot about that treatment told me I shouldn't place my faith in it...\r\nMirja: It's true that they say progress in the field of medical research is fierce going. However... Is that the only method that can cure your sister?\r\nYui: No... It's going bit by bit, but she really is getting better now.\r\nMirja: Is that research something that will soon be available for use?\r\nYui: Umm... I think they said, it was still at the stage of fundamental research?\r\nMirja: Then, that well informed person was right in what they said. You can't be certain of when a medical treatment still in the stage of fundamental research will be made available.\r\nMirja: This is only in regards to new forms of medicine, but... I've heard new medicines can take over a decade of research before they are made for general use.\r\nYui: It can take that long!?\r\nYui: (If that's true, then... Going the slow and steady way might actually be faster...)\r\nYui: (I can't be getting all torn up over it now; I've got to keep going at it the best I can, for Miku's sake!\r\nYui: Thanks a lot, Mirja-san! I'm past it now!\r\nYui: The girls of the investigation team really are the best there is!\r\nMirja: ...A crying child will soon be laughing, I suppose. Well, if you've recovered your spirit, then let's leave it at that.\r\nYui: Right! Yamashiro Yui's going at it in full spirit for another day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/UdyV4xZkk2E\r\n[Shinsengumi - Sayaka: Start]: A Sudden Acting Offer\r\n\r\nKofuki: Hey, why're we stopping by this place anyway?\r\nSayaka: ...I've been here before.\r\nMirja: That's correct. They said they were experiencing trouble, and made a polite appeal, or rather, a request to us.\r\nKofuki: Ooh, there's more aradama-chan here!? Well aren't we lucky! \r\nMirja: No, it isn't that kind of trouble. They requested a stuntman for their film.\r\nKofuki: Huh?\r\nSayaka: ...Stuntman?\r\nMirja: That's right.\r\nAssistant Director: Ah, it's a good thing you toji girls are here. A strange rumor started up that aradama show up in our studio, and it's been giving us problems... Serious problems.\r\nAssistant Director: They say there's a high chance of people getting hurt doing stunts here if any aradama come out. Stuntmen are turning us down... All of them, in fact.\r\nKofuki: That doesn't mean it's something you ask us to do though. I'm not doing it either.\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki, I understand your complaint. However, this is an issue that could be considered secondary damages caused by aradama.\r\nKofuki: Secondary damages?\r\nMirja: Secondary damages can happen in a variety of ways. This would be considered a case of harmful misinformation.\r\nMirja: Aradama are not commonly appearing here at the moment, but because that has happened in the past, as the director says, unfortunate rumors begin to arise.\r\nMirja: We won't be capable of supporting them for years to come, but, whenever possible, it should be our policy to assist them.\r\nKofuki: Damnit... Making me do the annoying jobs.\r\nSayaka: Mai told me about it. We have to boost the image of toji.\r\nMirja: In simpler terms, that's exactly right.\r\nAssistant Director: With that cleared up, we'd like to ask you to be our stuntman... Considering your physique, would you be able to do it?\r\nSayaka: You want me to do it?\r\nSayaka: I can't do anything like acting...\r\nAssistant Director: You won't need to say any lines. \r\nAssistant Director: What we want is for you to film you leaping around and jumping off rooftops. It seems like the director had seen toji fighting aradama before, and came up with the idea for this request.\r\nAssistant Director: We can't afford to delay shooting any longer, and with our lack of time, budget, and suspicious circumstances, we can't arrange to find new stuntmen, so please! \r\nSayaka: ...What should I do? Kofuki, Mirja...\r\nKofuki: Do whatever you want. If you don't want to, then say no.\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nSayaka: If there's something I can do to help... I want to do it. I don't know if I can do it right though...\r\nAssistant Director: Thank you! Really, thank you so much!\r\nAssistant Director: Here, the director and film crew are waiting over this way. We can go over the details with them.\r\n\r\nKofuki: Who'd have thought she'd end up being in a movie, huh-. Even Sayaka must be pretty shocked right about now.\r\nMirja: I'd imagine so. Though, I was somewhat surprised that Itomi Sayaka decided on it herself.\r\nKofuki: Well, yeah.\r\nMirja: And also, you have a fairly caring side yourself, to stay to look after her when we aren't even sure of when the filming will end.\r\nKofuki: That's just cause, if I went back, it's not like there's anything to do there either. \r\nMirja: I see. At any rate, the filming should be beginning shortly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Shinsengumi - Sayaka: End]: A True to Life Take\r\n\r\nFilm Director: ...Action, start!\r\nSoldier Actor: This is the Shinsengumi; we'll be taking you outlaw ronin in!

Face the camera, and act as though you're striking someone... One.)\r\nSayaka: YAH!\r\nRonin B: Run away, run away... Everybody split up!\r\nSayaka: (When that person runs, chase him.)\r\nSayaka: (Come around right in front of him, and point the tip of my sword toward him... Then done.)\r\nRonin B: Eee!?\r\nKofuki: She's actually not doing that bad.\r\nMirja: It should be no difficulty at all for her to jump about and wield an imitation sword like that.\r\nFilm Director: CUUUUUUUT!\r\n\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nKofuki: Yo, nice going. What was it like? Giving that a try.\r\nSayaka: I only... did the things they told me to do.\r\nSayaka: It's different, from fighting against aradama or in a sparring match... It felt a little strange.\r\nMirja: Even so, you performed it expertly. That haori fit you well too.\r\nSayaka: I couldn't tell for myself, but that's good.\r\nMirja: That director and assistant director made it clear they were very grateful, so it seems they thought it was a great performance.\r\nMirja: They said they were highly impressed you were able to do those movements without the help of wires.\r\nKofuki: And that they might come asking for your help again.\r\nSayaka: ...I won't do this again. I was a little nervous after all.\r\nKofuki: That's just cause nothing beats going up against aradama-chan.\r\nSayaka: That reminds me, they said they would send us movie tickets.\r\nMirja: All we can do now is pray the filming is finished without incident, so the film can be opened to the public.\r\nSayaka: Mm. If this can help boost the image of toji... I'll be glad.\r\nMirja: I'm sure you won't have to worry about that, Itomi Sayaka.\r\nKofuki: There's nothing left to do here, so lets go home already."}, {"paste_key": "vkhmV9qm", "title": "~Okatana with Flowers Shining in Full Bloom Chapter~", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/vkhmV9qm", "timestamp": "", "hits": "109", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/PjOQnrdBW6A\r\n\r\n1: A Grudge Over Food is a Fearsome Thing!\r\n\r\nKanami: Eh!?

I'm worried for how this will go now.\r\nSuzuka: There was a report of a strange group of girls being sighted at where we're headed as well...\r\nKaoru: A strange group of girls?\r\nSuzuka: That's right, a group of girls engaging the aradama without okatana...

What about Kiyoka-chan!?\r\nKiyoka: I don't know you either...\r\nTougou: What's going on, Sonocchi?\r\nSonoko: Hmmm, it might be hard for the toji to form memories of what happens in the Jukai... Maybe it was only like a dream to them.\r\nKarin: Well, even if they forgot, they're still the same as before. So we shouldn't have to worry about it then, right?\r\nItsuki: That's true... You're right! I'm sure we'll be friends again right away!\r\nFuu: It's still kind of unfortunate, but what can you do.\r\nMihono: I don't really know what's going on, but, sorry.\r\nYuuna: No, it's okay, you don't have to apologize for anything!\r\nSuzuka: Are you finished talking? Leaving that aside, there are plenty of things I would like to ask you all.\r\nItsuki: Wawa, a sort of scary person's here...\r\nSuzuka: I am from the Special Sword Administration Bureau, Konohana Suzuka, second seat of the elite guard. And you are?\r\nFuu: Third year at Sanshu Middle School, Inubouzaki Fuu. All of us are \"Heroes\".\r\nSuzuka: Heroes...? So you aren't toji after all. You don't appear to be using the weapons of a toji...\r\nYuuna: That's right! I'm a second year at Sanshu Middle School! I'm Yuuki Yuuna, the Hero!\r\nTougou: Second year at Sanshu Middle School, Tougou Mimori.\r\nKarin: Second year at Sanshu, a Hero, I'm Miyoshi Karin.\r\nItsuki: Umm, I'm a first year at Sanshu Middle School, Inubouzaki Itsuki...\r\nSonoko: Likewise, I'm a second year at Sanshu, Nogi Sonoko's here~!\r\nSuzuka: Sanshu Middle School... Not part of the Five Traditions either, then.\r\nSuzuka: Even though you aren't toji, you fight aradama. I find that hard to believe. We'll need to conduct an investigation.\r\nFuu: Ahaha, this is the second time we've gone through this, isn't it... Kitora-san said the same sort of thing.\r\nYuuna: Anyway, Konohana-san! Where in Shikoku are we?\r\nSuzuka: Shikoku? We aren't there; this is nearby to Kamakura.\r\nFuu: Kamakura!?\r\nFuu: ...Kamakura, as in, the Kamakura Shogunate?\r\nTougou: ...No, I think it's a city in the Kanagawa Prefecture that was once said to exist in Kanto.\r\nFuu: Kanto!? Isn't Kanto something from ancient history!?\r\nSuzuka: What are you saying? Kanto is currently right here.\r\nKaoru: This conversation's kinda all over the place...\r\nYuuna: U-Uhhh... What if this is... like we learned about in history class, the time before the Era of the Gods...?\r\nItsuki: What does that mean then!? Did we time travel?\r\nSonoko: Take a deep breath~, Yuuyu, Ittsun. I think what happened is the opposite of what happened last time.\r\nSonoko: Before, the toji came to the Jukai, and oppositely, the Heroes have now come to the toji world... That's all.\r\nSonoko: The Japan in the world the toji are from would have followed a completely different course of history to ours.\r\nYuuna: Oh. We didn't get the ask the toji about what their world was like back then, so that's what happened...\r\nSuzuka: Now then... What should we do about this. I can't quite follow what it is you're all talking about.\r\nMihono: Um, Konohana-san? I think we can trust them. They don't seem like they're bad or anything...\r\nYui: That's right! That's right! Girls that cute could never be bad people!\r\nKaoru: Ignoring what Yui's saying, they don't seem like they'd be our enemies. So wouldn't taking them into protective custody be the right thing to do here?\r\nKiyoka: I think that would be for the best too...\r\nSuzuka: ...Well, that's true.\r\nItsuki: Sigh, thank goodness-. It doesn't look like things will get rough...\r\nSuzuka: Besides, responding to the mass outbreak of aradama takes priority over dealing with you girls.\r\nYuuna: Are there really that many aradama out there?\r\nMihono: Yeah, and they're tough aradama too! It's an abnormal situation!\r\nYuuna: It is? Then, we'll help you defeat the aradama too!\r\nMihono: You will? Thanks!\r\nTougou: But, Yuuna-chan, we'll have to come up with a way to return to our own world as soon as we can.\r\nTougou: If something were to happen to our world while we're away...\r\nYuuna: Ah, that's right... Still, we can't just ignore the aradama either...\r\nSonoko: You're so kind, Yuuyu~.\r\nSonoko: Mm, I think I agree with Yuuyu here. And also, we can't be sure whether the abnormal outbreak of aradama and our coming to this world isn't related somehow.\r\nItsuski: What do you mean?\r\nSonoko: It might be that the Shinju-sama sent us here to this world, telling us to stop the aradama.\r\nTougou: I see... That might be a possibility...\r\nFuu: It's not like we know how to get back to our world, so it should be fine to take care of all these aradama for the time being.\r\nFuu: So that means, all us Heroes are going to help out with the aradama suppression!\r\nYui: Hooray! You can never have too many girls that'll fight right alongside you!\r\nKiyoka: When you talk like that, Yui-chan, I can only ever feel evil intentions...\r\nYui: What's that, Kiyoka-chan~, are you jealous? Don't worry, you're still my number 1!\r\nKiyoka: Sigh...\r\nMihono: The Hero girls are going to fight with us! That'll be a big help!\r\nYuuna: Yeah, let's all do whatever we can!\r\nSuzuka: Hold it right there, we haven't yet decided for you to fight...\r\nMihono: Your punches were awesome, Yuuna! I wanna try that too.\r\nYuuna: If you became a Hero, I bet you could do it too, Mihono-chan! You're likely to succeed if you try!\r\nMihono: A Hero-! Yeah, where there's a will, there's a way!\r\nSuzuka: ......\r\nKaoru: They've totally hit it off already.\r\nSuzuka: It seems there's no way around it. I'll report to Yukari-sama... As per my discretion in the field, these girls are permitted to fight alongside us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Hero Club Emergency Activity!\r\n\r\nMihono: HAAAA-!\r\nYuuna: EIII--!\r\nKiyoka: HAA-!\r\nTougou: I'll provide covering fire!\r\nMihono: Alright, I think we beat it. Ah, Kiyoka...\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nMihono: ......\r\nKaoru: KIEEEEEEE!\r\nKaoru: Phew, looks like all the aradama around here are dealt with. I wanna hurry back and catch some rest...\r\nFuu: It sure feels good having you toji with us against these aradama.\r\nSuzuka: Not just that. We wouldn't be able to suppress them so smoothly if not for your help.\r\nSuzuka: Now then, it seems a detached unit will be dealing with the aradama that appeared elsewhere, so we'll be on standby for the time being.\r\n\r\nYuuna: I'm bored, Tougou-saaan.\r\nTougou: Here, have some botamochi.\r\nYuuna: Ohmm... It's tasty.\r\nKarin: ...What are you two even doing?\r\nItsuki: Heh. They said we're on standby, but since we don't know what to do, it's a little troubling isn't it.\r\nFuu: Does anybody have anything they want to do?\r\nYuuna: Ah, it's not exactly something I want to do, but there is something I'm interested in!\r\nFuu: Go, Yuuna!\r\nYuuna: I haven't seen Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan talking to each other!\r\nSonoko: That's right, things seem a little tense between them. Could they be fighting?\r\nFuu: In that case, let's ask someone who'll know.\r\n\r\nYui: I've been called on!\r\nKaoru: So, what is it you wanted to ask us?\r\nYuuna: About Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan, are they fighting?\r\nYui: Ah-, it's about that-.\r\nYui: The truth is, Mihono-chan ate the pudding Kiyoka-chan bought.\r\nFuu: That'll mean war.\r\nItsuki: ...Though, at times like these, you're the one who eats the pudding, Onee-chan.\r\nFuu: Ahaha... A-Anyway, if that's the case, the Hero Club needs to take action!\r\nYuuna: Today's Hero Club activity is to get Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan to make up! Right?\r\nYui: Hero club? ...What's that?\r\nYuuna: We're a club that goes out with a good heart to do what we can to help everyone! That's why we're the Hero Club!\u3001\r\nTougou: We do club activities at our middle school. If someone is in trouble or needs assistance, we give them a helping hand.\r\nYuuna: Whether it's looking for foster parents for a cat, or cleaning up the neighborhood, or helping out at the Children's Festival! We'll take on helping friends make up too!\r\nKaoru: Like halfway between a jack of all trades and a volunteer group then.\r\nFuu: Well, if I had to put it simply, it's something like that.\r\nYui: A club! So that means, you Heroes always group up in a club room and do your activities!\r\nYui: All these cute girls! All grouped up in one room! What a wonderful secret garden!\r\nYui: Fuu-san! I'm going to join the Hero Club too!! I'll fill out a club entry form straight away!\r\nKaoru: What are you even going on about...\r\n\r\nFuu: Let's get back on topic! Today's Hero Club activity is~~... Tadah! We'll get Mihono and Kiyoka on friendly terms again!\r\nFuu: Does anyone have any good ideas?\r\nYui: Hmm, Kiyoka-chan was strangely mad this time, so I don't think she'll let Mihono-chan off very easy.\r\nSonoko: A grudge over pudding is a fearsome thing after all~.\r\nKaoru: Keep eating it over and over and anybody's patience'll run out.\r\nYuuna: Hmm, what should we do then, Tougou-san.\r\nTougou: It's difficult, isn't it.\r\nTougou: If I were angry at Yuuna-chan, I would forgive her as soon as she apologized though...\r\nKarin: What if she gives her a set of high grade supplements and niboshi?\r\nItsuki: I think you're the only one who would forgive someone with that, Karin-san...\r\nYuuna: I know! Since they're fighting over pudding, wouldn't it work if they make up over pudding too?\r\nYui: You mean, if we buy the same pudding that Kiyoka-chan bought, she'll forgive her?\r\nYuuna: No, what she should give her has got to be homemade! She can make up with Kiyoka-chan with homemade pudding!\r\n\r\nYuuna: So that's why, Mihono-chan, let's make pudding in a bucket, and then you can make up with Kiyoka-chan!\r\nMihono: Yuuna, Tougou-san, Sonoko... And Kaoru-san too, thanks, for coming to help me!\r\nMihono: I'll give my best attempt at making  a bucket of pudding!\r\nKaoru: ...At what point did it become a bucket of pudding?\r\nYuuna: If you're trying to make up with someone, bigger is always best!\r\nMihono: Yeah! A bucket of pudding would definitely make her happier than normal pudding!\r\nKaoru: ...These two are just peas in a pod, huh.\r\nSonoko: So long as they're having a good time~. By the way, do you know how to make pudding?\r\nYuuna: Ah, I don't know how...\r\nMihono: I don't either...\r\nTougou: Don't worry, Yuuna-chan, Mihono-chan. I know how you make it.\r\nSonoko: Wasshi, you can make western sweets too~?\r\nTougou: Japanese fare is my specialty, but it isn't like I completely dislike western sweets.\r\nTougou: You know that, don't you, Sonocchi? We had gelatto together after all.\r\nSonoko: Ahaha, that is true~.\r\nTougou: Anyway, I'll coach you through how to make it. Since we're making pudding, let's make the tastiest pudding we can!\r\nMihono: Yeah!\r\nTougou: That's a good serious look in your eyes, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: I'm the one who ate Kiyoka's pudding, after all.\r\nMihono: That's why, I'll make pudding that's way yummier than that pudding, and make up with Kiyoka for sure!\r\nKaoru: I mean, there's no way you're going to beat pudding that was up for sale.\r\nMihono: Where there's a will, there's a way!\r\nYuuna: Yeah, that's the spirit, Mihono-chan! You'll make up with Kiyoka-chan for sure!\r\nMihono: Yeah!\r\nMihono: ...Ah, I messed up.\r\nTougou: Don't worry, we brought Sonocchi and Kaoru-san along just for moments like these.\r\nKaoru/Sonoko: ...Huh?\r\n\r\nMihono: I did it... I did it, Yuuna!\r\nYuuna: You did it, Mihono-chan!\r\nKaoru: Burp... G-Great... If you messed up any more... I couldn't eat any more...\r\nSonoko: Partway through... I started to feel like I was the one being eaten by the pudding instead...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Kiyoka's Feelings\r\n\r\nWhile Mihono was making bucket pudding with Yuuna and the others...\r\n\r\nFuu: Then, Kamakura!\r\nKarin: We sure are in Kamakura, but... Were you really supposed to use \"Then, Kamakura!\" at times like this? \t\t[When major incidents happened during the Kamakura Shogunate, all samurai would be summoned to Kamakura, and over time this phrase just came to mean \"in case of emergency\"]\r\nFuu: Don't sweat the small things! Right now, let's have our fill of Kamakura!\r\nItsuki: Kiyoka-san, Yui-san. Thank you for taking us to see the sights on such short notice.\r\nYui: If a pretty looking girl like you is asking me to show her around, then I'm all over it!\r\nYui: Right, Kiyoka-chan!\r\nKiyoka: ...\r\nYui: Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKiyoka: Ah, sorry, I wasn't listening. What is it?\r\nItsuki: Thank you for taking us sightseeing, Kiyoka-san.\r\nKiyoka: It's fine, it's nothing to show you around!\r\nYui: ...Kiyoka-chan's head is off in the clouds.\r\nItsuki: Do you think her fight with Mihono-san is bothering her after all?\r\nYui: That's probably it. I've never seen them fighting for this long before...\r\nItsuki: I hope we can make things up between them here... We'll have to do our best to take Kiyoka-san out around town until Mihono is finished with her bucket pudding!\r\nYui: Itsuki-chan, you're so considerate... I love you!\r\nFuu: Whoa now! Before you lay a hand on my Itsuki, you'll have to go through me first!\r\nYui: Then it's a duel!\r\nKarin: ...What're they playing around for.\r\nKarin: Honestly... Kiyoka, is there any spots you'd recommend we go see?\r\nKiyoka: ...\r\nKarin: Sigh. If it's bothering you that much, then why are you even fighting with her in the first place?\r\nKiyoka: Uu... Wh-Why do you know about that...\r\nKarin: Anyone can tell just by seeing you two. Mihono ate your pudding, didn't she?\r\nKiyoka: You can tell that much just by looking!?\r\nYui: Ah, sorry. I told them about that part.\r\nKarin: I think it's Mihono's fault for eating the pudding, but have you not considered apologizing to her yourself?\r\nKiyoka: But... This isn't even the first time Hono-chan has eaten someone's pudding either...\r\nKiyoka: And also, I was looking forward to sharing it with everyone too...\r\nKiyoka: This time, I just wanted Hono-chan to apologize...\r\nFuu: I understand!\r\nFuu: A grudge over food is a fearsome thing~. I know if somebody ate the udon I was looking forward to having myself, I'd be mad for sure.\r\nKiyoka: Y-You would, wouldn't you!\r\nFuu: But you know, Kiyoka. If Mihono never apologizes, what happens then?\r\nKiyoka: Th-Then... I wouldn't like that.\r\nFuu: In that case, you don't have to think so hard about it.  If you want to make up with her, you just have to do it.\r\nItsuki: If you said you wanted to make up with her, I'm sure Mihono-san would be happy to hear it.\r\nKiyoka: ...You think so?\r\nItsuki: I do!\r\nKiyoka: ...Just give me a minute!\r\nKarin: Hey, where are you going!?\r\nKiyoka: I'm going... to buy some pudding!\r\nFuu: Good then, that's a case closed.\r\nYui: And a happy ending...\r\nItsuki: Wait, that's not good! If she goes back now, Mihono-san is still in the middle of making bucket pudding!\r\nYui/Fuu: Ah.\r\nKarin: There's no other way around it. Yui, tell us some famous sightseeing places.\r\nKarin: That's what we said to bring her out here to begin with, so when she gets back, we'll just do that to waste time like we planned.\r\nFuu: That ability to think on your feet... That's my Hero Club!\r\nYui: Karin-chan... I love you!\r\nKarin: You'll go for anyone, huh.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: ...I wonder if I can really make up with Hono-chan.\r\nYui: Considering it's Mihono-chan, I'm sure it'll go fine.\r\nFuu: That's right, Hero Club tenet number 5! You're likely to succeed if you try!\r\nKiyoka: ...Aha! I can do it if I try, right!\r\n\r\nMihono: Kiyoka, I'm sorry!\r\nKiyoka: Eh? A big, pudding...?\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah, Yuuna said, I needed pudding to make up for pudding... That's why, I worked real hard to make a bucket full of pudding!\r\nKiyoka: Umm, I followed Fuu-san's advice too, and I bought you some pudding...\r\nMihono: Eh, you got some too...?\r\nKiyoka: Y-Yeah...\r\nFuu: Fu fu, no use hiding it now that it's come out! That's right, in order to bring you two back together, the Hero Club was pulling the strings the whole time!\r\nMihono/Kiyoka: Pfft, ahahaha!\r\nMihono: Sorry again, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: No, I'm sorry too, Hono-chan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Mankai\r\n\r\nSuzuka: An aradama's signal has been detected. Is everyone ready?\r\nMihono/Kiyoka: Yes!\r\nYuuna: Alright, let's do our best-!\r\nSonoko: It feels fresh and exciting protecting somewhere outside of Shikoku~.\r\nKaoru: You know, you guys are weirdly fixated on Shikoku.\r\nKarin: It's not that we're fixated on it. It's just... In our world, Shikoku is all that's left.\r\nMihono: What do you mean?\r\nSonoko: In the world that we came from, for the last 300 years, the land outside of Shikoku has been inhospitable to human life.\r\nSonoko: Because of the vertex... The common enemy of humanity in our world.\r\nKaoru: ......\r\nKaoru: If I'm being honest, I only half believed all this stuff you were saying about another world, but it doesn't sound like you're messing around here.\r\nKaoru: Nobody would look so serious saying something like that if it were all a big lie.\r\nSonoko: Thank you... Kaoru-san.\r\nYui: Vertex... They're like the aradama are in our world, right? If something goes wrong here, our world could end up like that too...\r\nSuzuka: That's what we toji are here to prevent from happening. We're moving out!\r\n\r\nKarin: HAAAAAA!!\r\nFuu: Phew, aradama sure are tough. We can't use Mankai either...\r\nSonoko: Fuumin-senpai. It seems like we can use Mankai for this~.\r\nFuu: ...Huh?\r\nSonoko: A little bit ago, when no one was around, I used it myself in secret~.\r\nFuu: You what!? That's too reckless...\r\nSonoko: Don't worry, don't worry. As you can see, I'm just fine. The rules for Mankai now seem to be different from both in the past, when there was Sange, and also after it was updated.\r\nSonoko: There are no after-effects from Sange. It also seems like we can use it many times over. The Shinju-sama might be giving us a favor here~.\r\nFuu: Ehh!? Like an extra special measure...? The Shinju-sama must be going through good times...\r\nFuu: Well, alright then! Let's take full advantage of this favor! We're using Mankai, Itsuki!\r\nItsuki: Wait for me, Onee-chan! I'm going too!\r\nSuzuka: What is that about... They're overwhelmingly more capable than before.\r\nSonoko: That's called Mankai. It's a Hero's ultimate weapon~.\r\nMihono: And, all of you can do that?\r\nKarin: Yep. I'll show you what a complete Hero's Mankai looks like!\r\nSonoko: I'm going with you~!\r\nKaoru: Ohh, these guys, they're actually pretty strong.\r\nMihono: We've gotta put in our best effort too! Kiyoka, can you watch my back?\r\nKiyoka: Of course, Hono-chan!\r\nMihono: I'm counting on you! HAAAAAAA!!\r\nYuuna: Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan, they seem like they'll be fine now!\r\nTougou: They sure do. Mihono-chan is taking point, while Kiyoka-chan backs her up. \r\nTougou: They're a good match for each other.\r\nAradama: oooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nMihono: Uwah!? Some kind of super strong looking aradama just came out!?\r\nSuzuka: It's daunting compared to the aradama we've faced so far.\r\nTougou: The boss of them all must have shown itself here then.\r\nYuuna: Leave it to me! I'm using Mankai here!\r\nYuuna: HERO PUUUNCH!\r\nAradama: GUOOO!\r\nTougou: If you're going in, Yuuna-chan, then I'll be with you! I'll carry out an all out assault on the enemy forces!\r\nAradama: GUOOooo...!\r\nYuuna: Mihono-chan! Kiyoka-chan! We softened up the aradama!\r\nMihono: Okay! Just leave the rest to us!\r\nMihono: Let's go, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Right!\r\nMihono: The Heroes have some great teamwork and cooperation, but we'll show them the investigation team can do just as good too!\r\nKiyoka: Okay!! Let's do it!\r\nMihono/Kiyoka: HAAAAAA-!!\r\nAradama: OoooOOooo...\r\nMihono: We... We beat it!!\r\nKiyoka: We did, didn't we, Hono-chan!\r\nMihono: It's all because you were here with me!\r\nKiyoka: No, it's because you were so strong, Hono-chan!\r\nKarin: Look at that, now they're as close as can be.\r\nYui: Mmhm, that closeness is a thing of beauty. I want to get in there too!\r\nFuu: We beat the aradama, and Mihono and Kiyoka safely made up with each other! That's the Hero Club's work here finished! Good work, everyone!\r\nYuuna: Wh-What was that!?\r\nSonoko: Ah... It seems like, that's all for this time.\r\nSonoko: I'm starting to lose feeling in my body... I'm sure we're being drawn back to our world on the other side.\r\nMihono: You mean, we already have to say goodbye!?\r\nTougou: It seems that way... Though it's a shame. Like last time, it's so sudden.\r\nFuu: We might not have been together for long, but it was a lot of fun being in this world. Thanks for that.\r\nMihono: Wait! I still didn't...!\r\nYuuna: See you, everyone...\r\nMihono: Ah... They disappeared...\r\nKaoru: Man... They sure were a loud bunch. But with them gone, it'll be kind of lonely too.\r\nMihono: ...I still didn't tell them thanks for helping me make up with Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan...\r\nSuzuka: They say that what happens twice will happen thrice. If you want to thank them, you can do it next time you meet.\r\nMihono: Yeah, that's right, isn't it.\r\nMihono: Ah, oh yeah. Since the mission's over, does everyone want to go get something to eat?\r\nSuzuka: That sounds fine. Given the occasion, I think I'll join you.\r\nYui: Alright!\r\nKiyoka: What should we have?\r\nMihono: That'll be... Udon, of course!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: So I Never Forget Again\r\n\r\nSonoko: YAAAAAAA!\r\nMihono: DEEIIII-!!\r\nTougou: With that, the aradama have been suppressed.\r\nMihono: Thanks, Tougou-san, Sonoko! Now we just need to collect up the noro...\r\nMihono: Huh, someone's calling? It's Konohana-san.\r\nMihono: Hello, this is Asakura Mihono.\r\nSuzuka: This is a report from the Special Sword Administration Bureau. After defeating the aradama from this abnormal outbreak, there have been cases of unidentified objects being found along with the noro.\r\nMihono: Unidentified objects?\r\nSuzuka: Yes. The shape is always a four sided pyramid. As for their size, many of them are larger than a human body.\r\nSuzuka: I'll send a photo, so please confirm with those \"Heroes\" with you if they can shed any light on the subject.\r\nMihono: Whoa, what are those... They're like pyramids.\r\nMihono: Hey, Tougou-san, Sonoko! Do you know anything about these things? It sounds like they're coming out of aradama after they get beaten...\r\nTougou: This is.. The soul of a vertex!?\r\nMihono: Soul? What do you mean\r\nTougou: For the enemies that appear in our world, the vertex, this is something similar to their heart.\r\nSonoko: If this is coming out of aradama, then does that mean the aradamas out there have been eating up vertex souls~!?\r\nTougou: Mihono-chan, the aradama appearing now may have grown stronger because they've taken in these souls...\r\nMihono: Really!?\r\nSonoko: We can't prove it, but it sounds likely... The vertex and aradama both have their relation to divinity, so it could be the aradama have what it takes to assimilate it.\r\nSonoko: Either way, we can't go leaving those vertex souls here in your world, so we'll be bringing them back with us.\r\nMihono: Then, did the aradama we just beat have those in them too...?\r\nMihono: Wait, this isn't one of those pyramids. What is it?\r\nSonoko: Hmm, I haven't seen this before, but... I'm not getting a bad feeling from it, so I don't think it's dangerous?\r\nMihono: Okay, then I'm going to try touching it!\r\nSonoko: You really are a \"leap before you look!\" kind of girl, aren't you, Mihocchi~. Just like Yuuyu.\r\nMihono: You mean Yuuna? Well you're right, I feel like I could really get along with her!\r\nTougou: Fufu, that's true. You two are very much alike, so I'm sure you would get along.\r\nTougou: But, the closest one to Yuuna-chan will always be me.\r\nMihono: Uhh, your voice got all serious all of a sudden...\r\nMihono: Anyway, I'm going to try touching the weird object!\r\nMihono: Eh... Huh?\r\nTougou: What is it?\r\nMihono: Ah... It's like... I remembered. When we were in that Jukai place, all of us fighting along with the Heroes... Huh? Why did I forget about that, anyway?\r\nSonoko: After touching the strange object that came from the aradama, your memories came back...? Here, let me see that for a minute~.\r\nSonoko: Ah. There's a message, on the Hero app on our phones... \"Sensing a spiritual power\"?\r\nSonoko: ...Hmmmm, if the app is reacting to it, then maybe this could be, a piece of the Shinju-sama's power~?\r\nTougou: Then, when Mihono-chan came in contact with the Shinju-sama's power, her memories of us returned?\r\nMihono: If that's what happened... Then, so long as we have these, we won't forget all of you!?\r\nSonoko: Mmm~, I'd say there's a chance at least. We don't know how long the Shinju-sama's influence will go on for, so unless we collect a lot of them, it might not work.\r\nMihono: Okay-, then I'm going to collect a whole bunch! I'll beat all the aradama, and get them all! Where there's a will, there's a way!\r\nTougou: We'll give you assistance. We only just managed to meet again, so it would be too sad for you to forget.\r\nSonoko: I'll help too~!\r\nMihono: Thanks a lot! Let's go and beat up the next group of aradama right away!\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/f-Eb7Fydp_U\r\n[Yuusha 2 Yui: Start]: Little Sister and Big Sister\r\n\r\nYamashiro Yui has been paired with Inubouzaki Itsuki to suppress aradama...\r\n\r\nYui: It's a pleasure working with you, Itsuki-chan!\r\nItsuki: Y-Yes, thank you for working with me, Yui-san.\r\nYui: What's that, are you feeling nervous?\r\nItsuki: Yes... A little bit.\r\nItsuki: Up until now, whenever I fought aradama, it was with a lot more people, so this is my first time with just one other person...\r\nYui: You don't have to worry about a thing, Itsuki-chan. I might not look like it, but I'm super strong!\r\nYui: I'll be there for you whenever you need it!\r\nItsuki: Okay, I'll be in your care.\r\nYui: -!!\r\nYui: (Wh-What is this, this feeling...)\r\nYui: (This is different from what I feel with everyone in the investigation team... Could this be, my motherly instincts!?)\r\nItsuki: Yui-san?\r\nYui: It's nothing at all, nothing at all.\r\nYui: [inhale]... [exhale]... Okay! While we're moving around together, you can feel free to think of me as your big sister!\r\nItsuki: You'll be my big sister, Yui-san?\r\nYui: I might not look like it, but I have a real little sister, which makes me a real big sister.\r\nItsuki: If she has a big sister like you, your little sister must be having fun every day.\r\nYui: Itsuki-chan... I love you!\r\nItsuki: Thank you.\r\nYui: I want to be the best big sister I can be, so you don't know how happy it makes me to hear that.\r\nYui: That reminds me, what's Fuu-san usually like? As a fellow big sister, I'm a little curious.\r\nItsuki: What's Onee-chan like? Onee-chan, she's... She's like that.\r\nYui: Doesn't change at all, huh...\r\nYui: If she came to a different world and she's still acting the same as always, that's amazing.\r\nItsuki: Yes, Onee-chan's pretty amazing!\r\nYui: Fuhehe, you're so cuteee...\r\nItsuki: Yui-san?\r\nYui: [drool]... Oops.\r\nYui: (Control yourself! I've gotta make big sister moves in front of Itsuki-chan!)\r\nYui: Aradama!? Itsuki-chan, get ready for battle!\r\nItsuki: Right!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Yuusha 2 Yui: End]: There's No Such Thing As a Little Sister Who Hates Her Big Sister\r\n\r\nYui: YAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOOOOOOO!\r\nYui: It's a real pain with this many of them! Are you doing okay, Itsuki-chan!?\r\nItsuki: Yes, I'm fine... Kyaa-!\r\nYui: Itsuki-chan!?\r\nItsuki: I-I'm alright! More importantly... Can ask you to handle things here for a minute?\r\nYui: Sure, but... Do you have some kind of plan?\r\nItsuki: I was thinking of setting up a trap. It might not go that well though...\r\nYui: Don't worry about that at all! If it goes wrong, I'll be there to back you up!\r\nItsuki: Ah... Just now, you sounded like Onee-chan.\r\nYui: I didn't just sound like one; right now, I am your big sister! So just leave things here to me!\r\nItsuki: Please go ahead!\r\n\r\nAradama: oooo...  \r\nYui: Phew, that should be all of them. Nice work back there, Itsuki-chan!\r\nItsuki: Right, you were working hard too, Yui-san! Now we can go back to see everyone else.\r\nYui: ...Wait? Why are you holding your arm like that?\r\nItsuki: Th-That's because...\r\nYui: Something's fishy...\r\nYui: Show me your arm for a minute! --Hey, you're hurt!?\r\nItsuki: I got hurt, but this much is nothing really...\r\nYui: No matter how small it is, any injury on a cute girl is life-threatening! Let me see it!\r\nItsuki: O-Okay.\r\nItsuki: ...I didn't want to make you worry. I'm sorry.\r\nYui: You might not think it, but I'm pretty sharp when it comes to things like these. Since my little sister has a bit of an illness.\r\nItsuki: I hope she gets better soon then.\r\nYui: ...Thanks. I'd like to be able to go on trips and stuff with her someday.\r\nItsuki: You love your little sister, don't you.\r\nYui: Yeah. I bet I love her just as much as Fuu-san loves you-.\r\nItsuki: In that case, your little sister must love you even more than that.\r\nYui: Eh-, why do you think that-? I love her more for sure!\r\nItsuki: Because... There's no such thing as a little sister who doesn't love their big sister! I'm absolutely positive she love love loves you!\r\nYui: ...Well, I guess I can't beat that then. Suddenly I feel like paying Miku a visit.\r\nItsuki: I feel like going to see Onee-chan too.\r\nYui: Okay-, the aradama are dealt with, so let's hurry on back!\r\nItsuki: Right!"}, {"paste_key": "bm8J5B6W", "title": "~UDON Chapter~", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/bm8J5B6W", "timestamp": "", "hits": "314", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/Q1oMmLbcCeg\r\n\r\n1: The Hero Club's Udon Trip\r\n\r\nTV Reporter: Now then, for today's feature... Here! It's Japan's big three udon!\r\nFuu: Big three udon...!?\r\nFuu: There's no time to waste!!\r\n\r\nFuu: I want to go eat the big three udon!\r\nFuu: For that cause, since Konohana-san was busy with work, I had Satsuki-san come in her place!\r\nYomi: I am Satsuki Yomi, third seat of the elite guard.\r\nYomi: The instructions I received were to treat the Heroes to udon...\r\nYuuna: Yes, I have a question! What are the big three udon?\r\nYomi: There is a wide variety of types of udon.\r\nYomi: Among those, the especially famous Sanuki udon, Inaniwa udon, and Mizusawa udon are collectively called the big three udon.\r\nItsuki: What type of udon is it that we usually eat?\r\nYomi: Since you are all from Shikoku, if I were to guess, it's likely Sanuki udon.\r\nTougou: Sanuki... That's right, in the past, Kagawa was once known as the Sanuki Province.\r\nYomi: Sanuki udon is very well known, and popular among people across the country.\r\nFuu: That's our udon alright! So then, let's start by having some Sanuki udon!\r\n\r\nYomi: I've procured enough udon for all of you from a local shop famous for their Sanuki udon. Here you are.\r\nHeroes: Let's give it a try-!\r\nFuu: [slurrrp]...!? It's...\r\nKarin: It's good, but... Something's different, isn't it?\r\nSonoko: I think it doesn't have enough body to it~?\r\nYomi: I think the udon here is plenty delicious, though it may have lost some flavor compared to what you might find in its place of origin.\r\nTougou: What that means is, if we want to eat the true big three udon, we'll have to travel to their homelands.\r\nYuuna: Where does Inaniwa udon and Mizusawa udon come from?\r\nYomi: Inaniwa udon is from Akita, and Muzusawa udon is from Gunma.\r\nYuuna: Akita? Gunma?\r\nTougou: Regions that once existed in Japan. Akita was in the area known as Tohoku, and Gunma was in the area known as Kanto.\r\nYuuna: Hmmm... I have a feeling we went over that in history class!\r\nYomi: (In history class...? I had been told what to expect, but they really are strange people after all...)\r\nSonoko: We can always eat Sanuki udon when we go back home, but I want to eat Inaniwa udon and Mizusawa udon from their hometowns~!\r\nTougou: You shouldn't be so imposing, Sonocchi. We can't go all the way to Akita and Gunma only to eat some udon.\r\nYomi: We are working on a strict schedule, but that wouldn't be so unreasonable.\r\nYomi: If tomorrow would be fine with you, do you want to go?\r\nFuu: [SLURRRRRP]! Please take us, Satsuki-san! Tomorrow, the Hero Club sets out on their udon journey!\r\nFuu: Anyway, we'll have to stock up on energy! Let's get seconds!\r\nItsuki: Onee-chan, that's your third...\r\n\r\nThe next day, the Heroes and the toji gathered before the break of dawn.\r\n\r\nYuuna: Yawn... Morning, everybody! Isn't it fun, us all leaving this early! Kind of like a field trip!\r\nTougou: Thinking of breakfast, I borrowed a kitchen and made us some botamochi.\r\nTougou: If anyone wants any, here you are.\r\nSonoko: I do I do~.\r\nEllen: Oh! Is it alright for me to have some botamochi too?\r\nEllen: [chew chew]... Mmm, it's delicious!\r\nTougou: That golden colored hair, those blue eyes, and... That well pronounced English! Are you perhaps a \"westerner\"!?\r\nEllen: My mama is American. I'm Kohagura Ellen, a first year at Osafune Girls' Academy!\r\nEllen: I wanted to spend some time with you Heroes, so I'm tagging along on the udon tour! Let's have some fun today!\r\nTougou: An American wants to try udon...?\r\nEllen: Yes! Udon tastes so good!\r\nTougou: No one who enjoys udon could be a bad person... We'll welcome you along, Ellen-san. \r\nYuuna: Udon sure is powerful! It even made Tougou-san fast friends with someone from America!\r\nHiyori: Is that really something that shocking?\r\nYuuna: It really is! ...Wait, huh? Umm... Who are you?\r\nHiyori: Juujou Hiyori.\r\nHiyori: A friend of mine is from Gunma, but she couldn't come today because of a mission, so I came in her place to show you about Mizusawa udon.\r\nYuuna: Yay-, thank you! I'm so excited to try Mizusawa udon! Nice to meet you, Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: Y-Yeah...\r\nHiyori: (S-Seems like she's the type to act close from the moment you first meet...)\r\nYomi: Everyone is here, so let's move out. First, in Akita...\r\nHiyori: Hold on, Satsuki Yomi. The Mizusawa udon place Iwakura-san reccomends closes its doors before noon.\r\nHiyori: Could we go to Gunma first instead?\r\nYomi: If that's the case, then I understand.\r\nHiyori: Good then. Now I should be able to promote Mizusawa udon like Iwakura-san wanted.\r\nYuuna: If the store closes before noon, then I'm really looking forward to it!\r\nSonoko: Come on, let's go, Gunma!\r\n\r\nHiyori: From the map she gave me, it should be just ahead... Nn? That's weird; it's closed.\r\nItsuki: There's a sign up. \"As we can't restock, the store is temporarily closed\"... Ehh!?\r\n\r\nEllen: You say there's... an aradama infestation at the local spring?\r\nMizusawa Udon Seller: That's right...\r\nHiyori: Without being able to get your usual springwater, you can't open shop then, can you...\r\nYuuna: I won't let them get away with causing trouble for someone selling udon! That's too mean!!\r\nMizusawa Udon Seller: I'm begging you, please do something about those aradama! If I can just get a hold of that water... I'll treat you to the ultimate Mizusawa udon!\r\nHiyori: What should we do?\r\nYomi: The mission I was given was to escort the Heroes on their udon tour.\r\nYomi: And, as toji, suppressing aradama is our duty.\r\nKarin: There's no reason to think any harder about it then.\r\nYuuna: That's right! As Heroes, we can't ignore these aradama causing problems for everyone either!\r\nTougou: We'll defeat the aradama to bring back the Mizusawa udon. And then we can eat it. It's two birds with one stone.\r\nItsuki: After coming all this way, you can't help but be hungry for Mizusawa udon, can you!\r\nSonoko: Let's stop the aradama and get back the spring~!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Gunma: The Ultimate Mizusawa Udon\r\n\r\nYuuna: Alriiight! Let's go stop those aradama! We're going to have that Mizusawa udon for sure-!\r\nHeroes: Yeah-!\r\nEllen: You Heroes sure do love udon, don't you. Is there some special reason for that?\r\nEllen: Don't tell me, is udon the source of your hero power!?\r\nFuu: That's not completely off the mark, in the sense that we grew up eating udon...\r\nFuu: The source of our hero power... That would be udon and the girl power hidden deep in our hearts!\r\nTougou: It's Fuu-senpai's pet theory that udon will raise your girl power.\r\nEllen: Girl power... I see! That must be why you're all so cute!\r\nYuuna: Hey, Hiyori-chan, what's Mizusawa udon like?\r\nHiyori: What makes Mizusawa udon distinct is its pale white noodles. They're usually served as chilled zaru udon, but the dipping sauce will depend on where you eat it... Or so I hear.\r\nSonoko: Pale white noodles, hmm. This udon sounds like a real beauty~.\r\nHiyori: And also, compared to your average udon noodles, it's supposed to be a little bit thicker.\r\nItsuki: If the noodles are thick, then it should already have plenty of body to it.\r\nHiyori: Ah, about that, I was told it's not as if the noodles have more body than Sanuki udon.\r\nKarin: Hiyori, why do you keep saying \"supposed to be\" or \"I was told\" and that sort of thing?\r\nHiyori: I'm only passing on the information from a friend of mine who loves Mizusawa udon.\r\nHiyori: I don't know much about Mizusawa udon either. So I'm looking forward to it too.\r\nFuu: If that's how it is, let's beat up those aradama and get some udon ASAP!\r\nYomi: I've sighted the aradama. Are you prepared for battle?\r\nYuuna: I'm ready anytime!\r\nYomi: Then, let's begin.\r\n\r\nYomi: Now, as the spring has been safely recovered, the Mizusawa udon has been prepared.\r\nYomi: Here you are, everyone. Let's begin eating.\r\nEveryone: Let's eat-!\r\nYuuna: It's just like Hiyori-chan told us; these noodles are so pretty!\r\nSonoko: I know~! And this udon is so good it holds up to our udon back home~!\r\nTougou: The noodles aren't quite as thick as I was expecting, so it's easy to eat.\r\nEllen: It's delicious!\r\nKarin: This sesame sauce pairs with it pretty well too.\r\nItsuki: Yes! It tastes very good!\r\nFuu: [slurrrp]-! These cold noodles go down easy after all the exercise we just did!\r\nFuu: I'll have another!\r\n\r\nFuu: [slurrrp]-!\r\nFuu: With the way the taste changes, between this slightly sweet sesame sauce and the soy sauce, I feel like I could eat as many bowls as they put in front of me!\r\nFuu: I'll have another!\r\n\r\nFuu: [slurrrp]-!\r\nFuu: Good thing they have this tempura here as a palate cleanser! It helps reset the appetite!\r\nFuu: I'll have another!\r\n\r\nFuu: I'll have another!\r\nHiyori: Y-You're going to keep on eating...? Where are the noodles disappearing to?\r\nEllen: Maybe they're being converted into hero energy?\r\nEllen: Either way, she has such a healthy appetite! She's a big eating fighter! \r\nFuu: [slurrrp]-! Another!\r\nItsuki: I'm sorry about her, Onee-chan is just...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Akita: The Supreme Inaniwa Udon\r\n\r\nYomi: Next is Inaniwa udon. Our destination is Akita.\r\nFuu: The taste of Mizusawa udon totally lived up to the name of Japan's big three udon. I can't wait to try Inaniwa udon too!\r\nHiyori: After that many extra helpings, you can still fit in more... That's really something.\r\nItsuki: What is Inaniwa udon like?\r\nYomi: From your perspective, Inaniwa udon will be a thin type of udon.\r\nTougou: Thin? Do you mean like somen?\r\nYomi: Yes, it would be fine to think like that. It is a type of udon just thicker than somen.\r\nSonoko: A thin type of udon... An unknown type of udon just entered the picture~.\r\nYomi: I've made a reservation at the restaurant.\r\nYomi: I can assure you the taste will be delicious, so please look forward to it.\r\nYuuna: So it gets Satsuki-san's seal of approval! How soon before we get to Akita!\r\nKarin: Just hope the place wasn't shut down by aradama again.\r\nTougou: Fufu, something like that wouldn't happen twice in a row.\r\n\r\nYomi: Hello. We have a reservation, under Satsuki.\r\nInaniwa Udon Restaurant Clerk: You must be Miss Satsuki then. I apologize, but... Speaking honestly, it seems aradama have appeared along our transport route, and we've been unable to restock...\r\nKarin: Ehhh!? This again!?\r\nFuu: Geez, this is all your fault, Karin. You had to go and put up that weird flag.\r\nKarin: What do you mean, flag!?\r\nItsuki: Still... Why are all these udon related places being affected by aradama?\r\nFuu: The aradama just don't understand the deliciousness of udon... That's why they're making trouble for anyone selling it!\r\nSonoko: The enemies that come out in our world, the vertex, I've heard they'll completely ignore a bowl of udon too~.\r\nSonoko: Aradama and vertex; something so inhuman can never understand the greatness of udon~!\r\nYuuna: If only they could tell how delicious udon is, we might be able to come to terms with each other...\r\nHiyori: Uh, I don't think udon is going to help us reach a mutual understanding...\r\nFuu: Anyway, just like in Gunma, all we have to do is stop the aradama, right?\r\nInaniwa Udon Restaurant Clerk: I-If you would! Once we can restock, then we could prepare for you a supreme Inaniwa udon!\r\nEllen: Yes! Let's defeat the aradama and have some tasty Inaniwa udon!\r\nHeroes: Yeah-!\r\n\r\nFuu: We've been chasing the aradama for so long the sun's completely set.\r\nItsuki: We're on a straight trip, so it was bound to happen.\r\nHiyori: Come to think of it, I haven't seen Satsuki Yomi for a while.\r\nEllen: Oh, really? Where could she have gone off to?\r\nYomi: Did she get lost!? That's dangerous; we have to go look for her!\r\nHiyori: Satsuki Yomi is a member of the elite guard. I don't think we need to worry about her at all...\r\nFuu: My girl power is calling out to me...\r\nKarin: That's just your stomach growling.\r\nYuuna: But, aren't you feeling hungry by now?\r\nYomi: In that case, have some omusubi.\r\nHiyori: Satsuki Yomi!?\r\nEllen: Where did you go?\r\nYomi: I thought you would all be hungry on this lengthy mission, so while suppressing the aradama, I stopped to procure us food. I bought them somewhere I regularly get omusubi from.\r\nSonoko: These are! Such nice omusubi! The rice is glistening~!\r\nYomi: I will vouch for their taste.\r\nItsuki: Ah... This is some tasty rice.\r\nYomi: Thank you.\r\nKarin: The more you chew it, the sweeter it gets... Mm, the saltiness is good enough on its own.\r\nYomi: You're very familiar with this, Miyoshi-san.\r\nYomi: You should have some too, Juujou-san, Kohagura-san.\r\nHiyori: Thanks... Mm, it is good.\r\nEllen: I'm back at 100%! Let's beat these aradama quick and reclaim that Inaniwa udon!\r\n\r\nYomi: You did good work today, everyone. Now then... Let's eat.\r\nEveryone: Let's eat-!\r\nYuuna: Look, Tougou-san! It's completely different from how our udon is!\r\nTougou: It really is like somen noodles. But, the taste... It tastes properly like udon.\r\nSonoko: It's different from the udon we're used to, but this is tasty too~!\r\nFuu: Since the noodles are this thin, no matter how much you eat, it has to be low-calorie for sure. It's very healthy!\r\nItsuki: I don't think that's right, Onee-chan...\r\nKarin: Each of the big three udon tasted good, didn't they.\r\nYomi: About that... Sanuki and Inaniwa are considered staples of the big three, but there are actually many candidates for the third position.\r\nFuu: Eh!?\r\nYuuna: If there's that many candidates, that means there's that many kinds of tasty udon!? Nnn, I want to try them!\r\nItsuki: But, after today, we're all full...\r\nFuu: Okay-, after we get back to Kamakura, we can look up other big three udon candidates and start preparing for our next udon tour!\r\nHeroes: Yeah-!\r\nHiyori: There's just no limit to your passion for udon, is there...\r\nEllen: It is the source of their power, after all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Vm_3KVXqxvE\r\n[Yuusha 2: Hiyori: Start]: Toji and Heroes-- The Stoic Pair\r\n\r\nSonoko: We'll see you off from here~.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan, I know your aradama mission with Karin-chan will be a bit of a long trip, but do what you can.\r\nHiyori: Sure, you don't have to worry.\r\nKanami: I wanted to come along, to see more of Karin-chan's dual wielding, but it was too much when I have a mission of my own. That's a little disappointing.\r\nHiyori: As always... You act the same towards everyone when swordfighting is involved. Well, that's how you are.\r\nKanami: I mean, she can dual wield, can't she? Yukari-sama and Shichinosato-san can do it too, but it's not something you get to see all that often, is it?\r\nSonoko: Nibosshi, you get along with her without fighting, okay-? Also, here's 500 yen for snacks.\r\nKarin: Am I going on a field trip!? What if they think us Heroes can't take things seriously!\r\nSonoko: For your snacks-- Don't you think it would be best to re-energize with some sugar when you get a break? And also, Niboshi don't count as snacks, so don't worry about that~.\r\nKarin: Of course they don't. Niboshi form a complete diet.\r\nHiyori: (...Niboshi? Niboshi, huh.)\r\nHiyori: Anyway, we should leave.\r\nKarin: That's right, we won't get anything done waiting around here talking.\r\nKanami/Sonoko: Have a safe trip-!\r\n\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nKarin: .....\r\nHiyori: (At times like these, the sensible thing to do would be to find something to talk about, wouldn't it?)\r\nHiyori: (In that case... Alright.)\r\nHiyori: ...Hey.\r\nKarin: ...Hey.\r\nHiyori: Ah, oh. You can go ahead, Karin.\r\nKarin: I wasn't going to say anything important. You can say what you were going to first.\r\nHiyori: Alright.... Well, let's work together today. I've seen the way you fight, so I don't think we'll have anything to worry about.\r\nKarin: I made up my mind to help out, and I'll see it through. You can rely on me.\r\nKarin: It'll depend on how many aradama there are, but what if I soften them up, and you finish them off? That should be the most efficient course of action.\r\nHiyori: That should be fine. I was thinking of following the same plan once we got to the site.\r\nKarin: That's good then.\r\nHiyori: What were you about to say before?\r\nKarin: Would it be difficult to completely and fully eliminate all the aradama?\r\nKarin: There are people living in the town. And aradama appear there... No matter how you look at it, they're living right next door to danger.\r\nHiyori: If we could do that, that would be for the best. Though, unfortunately, we still haven't found an effective way of doing that.\r\nKarin: ...So if it were possible, you would have surely done it long ago. Sorry for asking something strange.\r\nHiyori: No, I don't mind.\r\nHiyori: You're a... You're a kind person, Karin. Without a second thought, you're worried for the people in our world too. Though, everyone in the Hero Club seems that way.\r\nKarin: I-Isn't that just normal...? That kind of attitude. All of you too, if you came to our world and had the strength to fight our enemies, you'd do it, wouldn't you?\r\nHiyori: That's true. I'd hope so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Yuusha 2: Hiyori: End]: Niboshi and Chocolate Mint\r\n\r\nKarin: TORYAAA-! --HAAH!\r\nAradama: AAAAaaaa...\r\nKarin: Now, Hiyori!\r\nHiyori: Right! --HAAAAHH!\r\nKarin: There don't seem to be any more aradama in sight for now, but what do you think?\r\nHiyori: Judging from the report, there should be a few more of them, but we don't seem likely to make contact with any more around here.\r\nHiyori: Why don't we move positions some while keeping on the alert.\r\nKarin: Alright. We should rehydrate now, while we have the opportunity.\r\nHiyori: Good idea. [gulp gulp]...\r\nKarin: I'll take some supplements too...\r\nHiyori: !?\r\nHiyori: (Just how many does she have!?)\r\nHiyori: ...Hey, why are you taking so many supplements?\r\nKarin: It's a part of keeping my body in healthy condition, of course. If I were getting sick often, I wouldn't be able to function as a Hero.\r\nHiyori: You have a point, but can't you get the nutrition you need from proper meals?\r\nKarin: ...I do eat proper meals too, whenever possible. [crunch crunch]...\r\nHiyori: ...And after supplements, you pull out niboshi.\r\nKarin: You see, niboshi doesn't just give you calcium, but also a whole host of vitamins, DPA, and EHA.\r\nKarin: And, since all the varieties of niboshi means you'll never get tired of it, it wouldn't be unreasonable to call it the perfect food.\r\nHiyori: You like niboshi, huh. So that's why they called you \"Nibosshi\".\r\nKarin: Sonoko's the only one who calls me that, okay...!\r\nKarin: Here, do you want some too?\r\nHiyori: I guess I'll have some. Prioritizing your health is just as important for a toji.\r\nHiyori: [crunch crunch]... These are good.\r\nKarin: Aren't they? I'm glad I got paired with someone who can understand the quality of niboshi.\r\nHiyori: I do like Japanese foods. I eat niboshi too, from time to time.\r\nKarin: What's your favorite food, Hiyori?\r\nHiyori: That would be nimono, and... Chocolate mint.\r\nKarin: You said you liked Japanese foods... I didn't expect to hear chocolate mint from you.\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nKarin: If you think up a type of chocolate mint you'd recommend, then let me know. I want to try it. Before I go back to our world.\r\nHiyori: ! Sure, you can look forward to it!\r\nHiyori: ...Sorry, I didn't mean to raise my voice just now.\r\nKarin: Hiyori... You love chocolate mint a lot, don't you.\r\nHiyori: I-I won't deny that. Anyway, let's go look for the rest of the aradama.\r\n\r\nKarin: This one is a bit bigger and more of a handful... But, with Hiyori and I, we can manage!\r\nHiyori: --This is the finish!\r\nKarin: Was that the last one?\r\nHiyori: Yeah. We finished suppressing the aradama sooner than scheduled. Thanks; it's because I had your help.\r\nKarin: It wasn't any trouble for me to come along.\r\n\r\nHiyori: This one's only chocolate mint flavor convenience store ice cream, but it's pretty good.\r\nKarin: I'll have some then. ...Nn!\r\nKarin: No wonder you recommended this; this is great.\r\nHiyori: That's good to hear... Sometimes, you get someone making senseless comments like \"chocolate mint is toothpaste\".\r\nKarin: Isn't that because toothpaste is just mint flavored, and not that chocolate mint tastes like toothpaste?\r\nHiyori: You got it, you really get it. It's such a relief you're one of the ones who understands, Karin.\r\nKarin: It's not that big a deal. Come on, we should head back soon.\r\nHiyori: That's true. I still have plenty more to recommend you. I'll give you the rest of them on the train.\r\nKarin: Hey... They aren't all chocolate mint, are they?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/H9uezyeVchU\r\n[Yuusha 2: Kiyoka: Start]: To Boost Up Our Girl Power!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: This time, the two of us will be suppressing aradama as a pair. You might not be able to rely on me for much... But I look forward to working with you.\r\nFuu: That's not true at all. I'll be counting on you, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nKiyoka: (Th-That's right. A hero like Fuu-san might be helping to clear out the aradama... But this is where a toji like me needs to get it together...!)\r\nKiyoka: Umm... Then, let's give it everything we've got, Fuu-san!\r\nFuu: Are you maybe feeling a bit nervous today?\r\nKiyoka: Ah... No, it's not like that!\r\nFuu: Then, that's fine, but it's not good for you to go all out all the time, alright?\r\nFuu: If you can't show your strength when it counts, you'll be in trouble, won't you?\r\nKiyoka: You're right about that. To tell the truth... I was feeling like I had to try even harder than usual.\r\nFuu: That feeling's important too. There's not a single thing wrong with feeling that way.\r\nKiyoka: How is it you can be so calm, Fuu-san? You're going through so much trouble, coming to our world and then helping us fight aradama, and yet...\r\nFuu: It's because I'm the leader of the Hero Club. Who's going to follow me if I don't take everything in stride?\r\nFuu: Though it's not really like that. It's hard for me to put in words, but, well... We're the ones who decided to help out defeating the aradama, and we know we can trust you toji.\r\nFuu: Anyway, if things get bad, I can just weaken the aradama with my overflowing girl power, so I'll be counting on you to finish them off, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: Your overflowing... Girl power!\r\nAradama: GUGGGGGIIII...!!\r\nFuu: Ah, there they are!\r\nKiyoka: Let's go, Fuu-san!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: ...And so that's what happened. She was a big help, getting me over my strange nervousness and finishing up our mission.\r\nItsuki: Onee-chan is good at picking up on things like that.\r\nKiyoka: Fuu-san has a strong sense of leadership, doesn't she. It's a different from Mirja-san, but I found myself depending on her before I knew it.\r\nKiyoka: On top of that, she's so cool and feminine.\r\nItsuki: Hmmm... I feel like you're the more feminine one, Kiyoka-san. You know so much about fashion, and the way you accessorize is cute too.\r\nKiyoka: I'm not that... I still have a long ways to go. I also heard about Fuu-san that her cooking is her specialty.\r\nItsuki: Onee-chan's cooking is delicious. She does all the chores around home too.\r\nKiyoka: She's incredible... I really look up to her. I might've wanted to have a big sister like that myself.\r\nFuu: What do you think, Itsuki? About your reliable big sister you're so proud of.\r\nItsuki: Come on, Onee-chan. You're letting it go to your head.\r\nKiyoka: Fuu-san!\r\nFuu: Ah, sorry for getting caught up in the moment.\r\nKiyoka: I... I want to learn to be as feminine as you are, Fuu-san! Could I ask you to give me special training to raise my girl power...!?\r\nItsuki: Ehh...!? Um, Kiyoka-san... I think it would be best if you didn't go there. About Oee-chan's... girl power...\r\nFuu: I hear your request loud and clear. I don't know how long it will take, but I'll do all I can to help boost your girl power, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Ah, thank you very much... Fuu-san!\r\nFuu: The road to improving your girl power is steep and perilous. We'll start your training straight away, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Okay!\r\nItsuki: Th-They'll be fine... Probably?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Yuusha 2: Kiyoka: End]: The Key to Raising One's Girl Power is...\r\n\r\nTougou: Hey, Itsuki-chan? We just ate a little while ago, so why are Fuu-senpai and Kiyoka-chan sitting in front of bowls of udon?\r\nItsuki: That's because...\r\nFuu: There's lots of things that can boost your girl power, like practicing cooking and stuff, but the most effective method is udon!\r\nKiyoka: Udon!?\r\nFuu: That's right. Udon is packed with all the ingredients you need for girl power! And-, with enough girl power, you can do anything-!\r\nKiyoka: I-I got it!\r\nKiyoka: (I don't exactly understand... why eating udon is meant to make you more feminine. But I just have to have faith in Fuu-san for now.)\r\nFuu: Now, eat up the udon that's loved by all across the nation, and raise up your girl power!\r\nKiyoka: Udon is loved on that kind of level in the world you came from!?\r\nFuu: Sure; udon is at the very tip top of gourmet food. Come on, while it's still hot!\r\nKiyoka: I-I'll give it a try...!\r\nFuu: [chew chew]... Even in this world, udon's still the best! ...It's filling me up!\r\nKiyoka: Yes... It's very tasty, isn't it!\r\nFuu: I think I'll just keep going on into seconds...?\r\nKiyoka: [chew chew]... A-Already!? I-I have to... try harder too-!\r\nTougou: Ahh... You can't do that, Kiyoka-chan. If you try to have as many helpings as Fuu-senpai...\r\n\r\nFuu: Thank you for coming along to the Inubouzaki Fuu-style Girl Power Boosting Special Training.\r\nKiyoka: I'm sorry, but... Fuu-san? We ate udon and then exercised together, but I don't feel like I've gotten any more girl power yet...\r\nFuu: Girl power is something that exudes on its own. You might not feel it right away, but when you do, you'll know for sure it's gone up. Believe you me!\r\nKiyoka: Girl power exudes on its own... You sure know your stuff, Fuu-san.\r\nKiyoka: I understand then! Now, let's go and do a good job of suppressing aradama again today.\r\nKiyoka: Ah! There's a big park nearby here. I don't want to let the aradama come near it.\r\nFuu: Of course. We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.\r\n\r\nFuu: Kiyoka! I drove it over your way! I'm counting on you!\r\nAradama: ...!\r\nKiyoka: --HAAA!\r\nKiyoka: The readings from aradama in the area are gone. It seems like that was the last one.\r\nFuu: Nice job-. Toji sure are something else. You had my eyes glued to the way you were handling that sword of yours.\r\nKiyoka: It's just really easy to coordinate with you, Fuu-san. So, I sort of feel like I should be thanking you.\r\nFuu: You don't have to thank me or anything. You're already doing a lot for us. Ah, actually, mind if we stop by somewhere for a bit?\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Wow... It's so pretty here. I've never been to this park before.\r\nKiyoka: It's a good thing we stopped the aradama from running amok here.\r\nFuu: That's for sure-. That's another thing you worked hard for, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: That's not true... It wasn't just because of me.\r\nFuu: You can't deny you're the one who defeated all those aradama today, can you?\r\nKiyoka: Somehow, I just felt a little less hesitant today with my swordsmanship.\r\nFuu: Fu fu fu, don't you get it? That's the proof of your girl power.\r\nKiyoka: It is!?\r\nFuu: Yep. Now that your girl power's gone up, I'm sure you won't lose to any aradama. Be confident in yourself, Kiyoka.\r\nFuu: A girl full of confidence is the strongest there is.\r\nKiyoka: Now that you mention it, attractive girls always seem to have a lot of confidence, don't they.\r\nKiyoka: Thank you for all you've done for me, Fuu-san.\r\nFuu: Hm? What do you mean?\r\nKiyoka: You gave me all that encouragement to help me feel confident in myself.\r\nFuu: Ahaha-, you noticed, huh?\r\nFuu: (She caught my interest for some reason, so I might've gone overboard with getting in her business.)\r\nFuu: Did I overdo it a little?\r\nKiyoka: Fufu, only when you made girl power sound so all powerful. But, I was very glad for your help.\r\nKiyoka: I think I'll keep working towards bringing up my girl power from now on!\r\nFuu: Mmhm. That's the spirit. You can do it, Kiyoka!"}, {"paste_key": "wANyuJGs", "title": "4-7 A Chance Meeting", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/wANyuJGs", "timestamp": "", "hits": "115", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/5jKV2DOt2KQ\r\n\r\n1: Passing Time\r\n\r\nTwo months after the calamity that became known as the \"Year-End Disaster\"--\r\n\r\nMihono: After the \"Year-End Disaster\", great amounts of noro rained down all across the Tokyo area.\r\nMihono: Winter ended, and along with the melting snow, it sank into the earth and disappeared.\r\nMihono: The damage the aradama had done to Tokyo was being rebuilt, and everyone tried to return to the way their lives were before.\r\nMihono: But, there was a great scar left in people's hearts, and the Sword Administration Bureau was in the tough position of taking the blame for the incident.\r\nMihono: Still, toji were needed to suppress the constant appearances of aradama, and for us, the days were always busy.\r\nMihono: In those days when Kanami and Juujou-san were no longer here--\r\n\r\nKofuki: C'mon, come get my love!!\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nKofuki: Alright-, that's that done!  Mmm~, aradama-chan sure are the best!\r\nKiyoka: You're as energetic as ever, Kofuki-san...\r\nKofuki: Huh? What're you acting all beat down for?\r\nKiyoka: This is our seventh assignment, and that's just today. Anyone would feel tired.\r\nChie: When things are this busy, you can't help but want a bit of a break, can you.\r\nKofuki: You guys've gotta get it together. I'm not feeling worn out one bit. I could just keep going till I've had my fun.\r\nMirja: I would appreciate it if you could also bring that energy to our duties that don't involve suppressing aradama.\r\nKofuki: What're you talking about? Beating up aradama is a toji's job. Can't we just leave all that other stuff to somebody else?\r\nKofuki: Chichie could even handle it all for us. Actually, we should do that. Just slap down all the paperwork!\r\nChie: Ufufu, Kofuki-chan? Why don't we have a quick chat in private?\r\nKofuki: I-I'm just joking! That face you make is freaky, so cut it out... Ever since you got accepted to college, it's like you're way more intense...\r\nMihono: Still, how long do you think this will go on for, with aradama popping out over and over?\r\nKiyoka: Even though Tagitsuhime is gone, instead of there being less, it's just more and more.\r\nMirja: It's unclear how long this will continue, but so long as they do keep appearing, all we can do is cut down and exorcise them.\r\nKiyoka: Of course... Sigh~...\r\nKofuki: So long as there's aradama around, we'll never have trouble finding work to do, so you should be happy if anything.\r\nMihono: What you're happy about isn't getting more work, but having more aradama to play with, right, Fukki?\r\nKofuki: You know it!\r\nMihono: But you know, it's been two whole months since then... Kanami...\r\nKiyoka: I-I know! Since we worked so much today, why don't we give ourselves a reward and go have some crepes?\r\nChie: That sounds nice! Shall we?\r\nMirja: I have no objection.\r\nKiyoka: Urgh, is that an emergency suppression mission...?\r\nMirja: This is Kitora. Yes.... Yes, I understand. We will head to the site at once.\r\nMirja: Everyone, unfortunately--\r\nChie: You don't have to tell us, Mirja!

Hiyori-chaaaan......\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chaaan! Haa...\r\nKanami: Just how much time has passed since then?\r\nKanami: Chidori?\r\nKanami: It's my... house?\r\nKanami: Daaad? Onii-chaaan?\r\nKanami: ...Nobody's home.\r\nMinato: Kanami?\r\nKanami: Master...!?\r\n\r\nAs Etou Kanami met with Fujiwara Minato, Juujou Hiyori was--\r\n\r\nHiyori: This is... my home? What's going on?\r\nHiyori: I see, this is my home from my memories. The feel and smell of the place, it's just like the real thing.\r\nHiyori: How many days has it been? Since then, Kanami...\r\n\r\nHiyori: I doubt it will overcome your loneliness, but I'll go together with you.\r\nTagitsu: Your life alone is far too lacking for that. The world in its entirety will go with me.\r\nHiyori: ...Sorry, Kanami. I lied to you.\r\nHiyori: Right now, I have to go with Tagitsuhime to the depths of the netherworld.\r\nKanami: ...I knew you did.\r\nKanami: YAH!\r\nTagitsu: Nn...!?\r\nKanami: In Shinkage-ryu, a thrust is considered a dead sword. There's nothing beyond that; this is my final strike.\t\t[Thrusting is considering a \"dead sword\" because of its lack of concern for what comes after. It leaves you open and unable to respond. Kanami calls it her final strike to show her determination that, whatever comes after, she's resolved to accept it.]\r\nKanami: I can't give you everything. Neither can Hiyori-chan. But in exchange, you can have half my life.\r\nHiyori: Kanami!?\r\nKanami: I promised, didn't I? That I'd take half of it.\r\nTagitsu: So both generations of mother and daughter pursue the same end.\r\nKanami: Fate is strange like that, isn't it, Tagitsuhime.\r\nTagitsu: Fu, fufu... Fate.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: Right...!\r\nHiyori: UOOOOOOOHHH--!!\r\nKanami: UOOOOOOOHHH--!!\r\n\r\nHiyori: Kanami, she was... She was planning that from the start. She knew what I would do...\r\nHiyori: You idiot-! When you said you would carry half the burden, was that what you meant!?\r\nHiyori: Just like our mothers... We...\r\nHiyori: I wish I could just see Kanami, one more time. Then, for sure... I'd...\r\nKagari: ...Hello?\r\nHiyori: --Who's there!?\r\nKagari: Who are... you?\r\nHiyori: ......Mother...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Truth Told\r\n\r\nKagari: ...Mother?\r\nHiyori: I-I'm, I'm Hiyori! Juujou Hiyori! I'm your... I'm Hiiragi Kagari's daughter!\r\nKagari: Eh?\r\nHiyori: U-Um... You should be my mother from the time of the great disaster, so my mother is actually a different person though...\r\nHiyori: A-After all, if somebody about the same age as you suddenly said they were your daughter--\r\nKagari: Kogarasumaru.\r\nHiyori: Eh?\r\nKagari: You were chosen by Kogarasumaru as well, weren't you.\r\nHiyori: ...It wasn't passed to me officially. My mother... I inherited it from the you from my time.\r\nKagari: From... me...?\r\nHiyori: That, and also this.\r\nKagari: This is... the one that I used...\r\nHiyori: That's right.\r\nKagari: I brought this from the Hiiragi family home, when I went to serve at Yukari-sama's side.\r\nKagari: And there are two of the same Kogarasumaru. More than likely, yours is the real one, while mine is something of a phantom of the netherworld.\r\nKagari: Just like myself, it's not something of the real world.\r\nHiyori: ...Not something of the real world. So that's what it is!\r\nHiyori: Just like you were split from my mother, Kogarasumaru was also split in two. The netherworld made up for whatever was missing somehow.\r\nKagari: In two...\r\nHiyori: It's the same for Chidori, that Kanami... that Minato-san used.\r\nKagari: Chidori? Then, does that mean, Minato-senpai met the same fate as I did...?\r\n\r\nKagari: So Minato-senpai did... I see... Something like that happened.\r\nKagari: Because of my weakness, even Minato-senpai was drawn into this...\r\nHiyori: S-Still! It's because of that that Tagitsuhime was defeated.\r\nKagari: What about Yukari-sama...?\r\nHiyori: She was with us until the final battle.\r\nKagari: Do you resent Yukari-sama?\r\nHiyori: My mother... In my world, you were always filled with regret.\r\nHiyori: For being unable to fully destroy Tagitsuhime. And for involving Kanami's mother, Minato-san.\r\nKagari: That's...\r\nHiyori: ...Even now, I can never forget the sight of my mother breaking down in tears after hearing about Minato-san's death over the phone.\r\nKagari: ......\r\nHiyori: In her final years... While my mother was in her sickbed, I almost never saw her smile.\r\nHiyori: Sometimes, in her nightmares, she would cry about needing to destroy the great aradama, Origami Yukari...\r\nKagari: I see... And so you came to the wrong conclusion.\r\nHiyori: Eh?\r\nKagari: I was saved by both Minato-senpai and Yukari-sama.\r\nKagari: Originally, I was to send Tagitsuhime to the netherworld on my own.\r\nKagari: But, Minato-senpai shortened her own lifespan to take on half of my burden.\r\nKagari: That's why I... Why the other me was spared, and...\r\nHiyori: Why I came to be here.\r\nKagari: And also, together we could only rival Tagitsuhime's power. No, Tagitsuhime slightly overpowered us. The one who brought it to a stop was Yukari-sama, from the real world.\r\nKagari: If anything, after offering up her body, Yukari-sama must have suffered the most over these twenty years.\r\nHiyori: .........\r\nKagari: That's why, Hiyori... san. Please don't resent Yukari-sama for what she did.\r\nHiyori: .........\r\nHiyori: .........Alright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Everyone At Present\r\n\r\nToji: One! Two! One Two! One! Two!\r\nMai: Come on, everyone-! Your arms are dropping down!\r\nToji: Right!\r\nMai: Ufufu, would Kanami-chan be surprised, seeing me instructing our kouhai.\r\nMai: Hey, Kanami-chan. It's the best time to see the cherry blossoms now.\r\n\r\nFriedman: The passport to the outside world originally belonged to them.\r\nFriedman: Could we not be good neighbors to them, who have no other place to go?\r\nEllen: If they saw Kaoru and Nene, they'd realize. I'm sure we can come to understand each other!\r\n\r\nKaoru: [snooze]......\r\nNene: Ne-...\r\nSana: Damnit, Kaoru-! Where're you slacking off now!?\r\nKaoru: Ahh... I'm in the middle of an afternoon nap-- No, that's not it. I'm in the middle of guard duty.\r\nNene: Neeeeee....\r\nSana: I heard that part about the nap! You know you're the captain of the raid unit, don't you! Get to work already!\r\nKaoru: It'll be fine if you just leave it to Sayaka. End of transmission.\u3000\r\nSana: HEYYY!\r\nKaoru: She was looking extra determined, so things should be fine with her. Anyway~, guess I'll go back to sleep.\r\nNene: Neeee....\r\n\r\nSana: That little... I'll beat it into her when she gets back.\r\nYuzuki: It's difficult, isn't it, Sana...\r\nSana: It really is... And I have to keep on acting as director...\r\nYuzuki: But, it's something you'll grow used to.\r\nSana: Sigh... I want a vacation and a bonus. Yuzuki-senpai, are you heading over to there now?\r\nYuzuki: I am.\r\nSana: Say hi to Yukari-senpai for me then. And, to Yukina-senpai too.\r\nYuzuki: Alright. I'll tell them.\r\n\r\nToji 1: Prioritize getting the nearby people to safety!\r\nToji 2: All members, spread out at once! Depending on your position, attack-- Ah! She's--!\r\nSayaka: YAH!\r\nAradama: GYAUUuuuun!\r\nSayaka: ...You can rest. You don't have to be lonely now.\r\nToji 1: Itomi-san...\r\nToji 2: From the Special Raid Unit... Incredible... With one sweep, she took out three aradama...\r\nSayaka: I have to work hard, to make up for Kanami and Hiyori while they're gone.\r\nSayaka: But, they should come back soon... Everyone is waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: A Reunion After Twenty Years\r\n\r\nMinato: Hmm, so you cut through Hiyori-chan's lightning. Then, this isn't Chidori anymore; it's Raikiri, right?\r\nKanami: You had Chidori with you too, didn't you?\r\nMinato: It could be we were able to meet because we both carry the same Chidori.\r\nKanami: Ahh, that might be it!\r\nMinato: Huh? Chidori resonated?\r\nKanami: This is...\r\n\r\nKagari: It's likely this place is only a small gap drifting in the netherworld.\r\nKagari: I think it was created from Minato-senpai, Yukari-sama, Tagitsuhime, and myself. Because of the combined force of us pulling against each other.\r\nKagari: But, with Tagitsuhime sent to the netherworld, this place will also finally disappear into its depths.\r\nHiyori: ...I see. I'm glad I was able to meet you, in the end.\r\nKagari: Um, Hiyori-san? Can you tell me anything, about me that was in your world?\r\nHiyori: I loved the nimono my mother would make. So much that she taught me how to make the soup stock for it.\r\nKagari: My mother, your grandmother, was the one who taught me how to do that.\r\nHiyori: You told me about that.\r\nKagari: Fufu, it's a strange feeling. You know so much about my future that I know nothing of.\r\nHiyori: It must be...\r\nKagari: That sound was...?\r\nHiyori: It's resonating...? Could it be!\r\nHiyori: Kanami might be somewhere nearby here!\r\n\r\nKanami: It did it again. And it's getting stronger. Hiyori-chan is around here!\r\nMinato: Eh?\r\nKanami: When I first came here, Chidori guided me. And then I found you, Master. So I'm sure, it's leading me again.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chaaaaaaaan!!\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan!?\r\nHiyori: Kanami!\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chaaan!\r\nHiyori: Kanami, I thought I'd never see you again...!\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan! Thank goodness! Thank goodness...!\r\nKagari: ...It's been quite some time. Minato-senpai.\r\nMinato: Long time no see, Kagari.\r\nKagari: Minato-senpai... I... I... I'm so sorry...\r\nMinato: There, there. I'm so glad I got to see you again, Kagari.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: So Long As They Live (1)\r\n\r\nYukari: How is the reconstruction of shrines housing noro going?\r\nYuzuki: It's going well. The local governments are all being cooperative, and many new ones are being established.\r\nYuzuki: With this, we'll get closer to the old ways of people coexisting with noro.\r\nYukari: Then ultimately, Tagitsuhime's actions did have an effect on the people...\r\nYuzuki: When she returns, whether after decades or centuries, we might greet her not as an evil god, but a stable one.\r\nYuzuki: Also, the restructuring plan is in its final stage. If we continue at this rate, we can put it into effect under the new order.\r\nYuzuki: Saying that, we still have plenty obstacles to face. We'll have to get you back soon, Yukari.\r\nYukari: What about the search for Etou and Juujou?\r\nYuzuki: It's ongoing, but nothing has been found...\r\nYukari: Keep it going. Don't let their fire burn out.\r\nYuzuki: We won't.\r\nYukari: So the cherry blossoms are falling already.\r\nYuzuki: Soon enough, each school will begin their qualifiers for the tournament. If Etou were here, she'd surely be part of it.\r\nYuzuki: Ah... Sorry.\r\nYukari: Asakura must hate me for what happened... No, they all must.\r\nYuzuki: There wasn't any other way. They all know you took that terrible role upon yourself.\r\nYukari: ......\r\n\r\nYume: It's the end for youuu~!\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAAA!\r\nMaki: Expertly done, Yume. Just, don't overwork yourself.\r\nYume: Geez~, Maki-onee-san. You worry way too much.\r\nMaki: You say that, but...\r\nSuzuka: I understand your concern, but if you're too overprotective, Yume won't stand the feeling of being smothered.\r\nYume: Yeah, yeah, you have to trust in me some more! Maki-onee-san!\r\nMaki: I see... You're right.\r\nYume: Though, I think I am actually a little worn out. Why are there so many aradama? I keep on chopping them up but there's still more.\r\nSuzuka: The netherworld was sealed off, but, as Hirukomitama rained across the ground, the rate of aradama appearances has only grown from before--\r\nSuzuka: Or so it seems to be the case.\r\nMaki: Whatever the cause, if aradama appear, we only have to cut them down. That's what the elite guard is here for.\r\nYume: You got it wrong. We're the special defense team now, aren't we? Well, so long as its the four of us, it doesn't really matter.\r\nSuzuka: That's true. A name has no bearing on anything. What matters most is that all of us are together.\r\nMaki: Right, after we finish this mission, let's go pay Yomi a visit.\r\nYume: I want to!\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nYume: Geh, more came out!\r\nSuzuka: There truly is no end to them.\r\nMaki: We'll finish this quickly! We're losing time to see Yomi!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: So Long As They Live (2)\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Sigh~, if at all possible, I would like for that to be the end of it.\r\nAradama: GSHHAAAAAAAAA!\r\nYume: No way-, there's more!?

Her swordsmanship too, even more than before...\r\nMaki: That's for sure. Suzuka. We should get stronger too... Together.\r\nSuzuka: O-Okay!\r\n\r\nYuzuki: Yukina, it's been some time. How are you feeling?\r\nYukina: Yuzuki... senpai.\r\nYuzuki: Sorry. I couldn't find an opening.\r\nYukari: What could you want, from me.\r\nYuzuki: There's something I wanted to give to you today. This here.\r\nYukina: Suijingiri Kanemitsu...?\r\nYuzuki: You should be the one to give it to Satsuki Yomi. I'm sure it would make her happy.\r\nYukina: ...Couldn't you just give it to her yourself. Tell her it came from me if you must.\r\nYuzuki: .........Alright then.\r\n\r\nYomi: .........\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: So They Can Be Welcomed Back Anytime\r\n\r\nMai: How is it?\r\nSayaka: ...Mm, it's good. The smell especially is good this time.\r\nMai: You can tell!? That's amazing! I was right to ask you to give these a taste test after all, Sayaka-chan. These mint liquor ones are my own creation.\r\nSayaka: You're the amazing one, Mai. You can make these sweets.\r\nMai: That's not true at all. It was far far simpler than I thought it would be. All I needed to do was soak the mint in sake.\u3000\r\nMai: The internet really comes in handy at times like these. There's lots of different types of mint, so later, I'll try soaking some more.\r\nMai: And then, next time, I was thinking of trying to make pancakes. Chocolate mint pancakes.\r\nSayaka: Mm, I'm sure Hiyori will be happy too.\r\nMai: She would be, wouldn't she. Alright, next, to make Kanami-chan's share.\r\nMai: Ah, that's right.

Let's all take caution so that no one gets lost.\r\nYui: Okay! You got it, Mirja-san!\r\nMirja: ...I don't see anyone besides you, Yamashiro Yui. What happened to the others?\r\nYui: While you were talking, they all got swept away in the crowd!\r\nMirja: I see.\r\nMirja: There's nothing we can do if we've already become separated. I'll notify everyone to make their first shrine visit on their own.\r\nYui: So basically, that means I get to make my first shrine visit all alone with you?\r\nMirja: That's how it is.\r\nYui: Hyaa~! I'm so excited~!!\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui, I propose we take measures to avoid splitting up any further. Put out your hand.\r\nYui: Y-You don't mean...!?\r\nMirja: We'll hold hands.\r\nYui: Ahh, give me a second, give me a second pleaseee! I'll take my glove off right now!\r\nYui: Wh-What do I do about my hand sweating... Ahh, Mirja-san's hand, it's so rough... Wait, you're wearing a glove!\r\nMirja: Will you please wear a glove as well? Your hand will get frostbite.\r\nMirja: After you put your glove back on, we'll get in line to visit the shrine.\r\nYui: Wha-- You mean that line that looks like it'll for sure take an hour to get through!? You know that lovers always break up because of long waits in lines, don't you!?\r\nMirja: We came here to make our first shrine visit, so of course I do. And also, where did you learn that statistic?\r\nYui: From my own research!\r\nYui: And so, for the sake of our future together, we should go draw our fortunes first!\r\n\r\nYui: ...Mirja-san, isn't it kind of like we're on a date together?  Kyaa! I said it!\r\nMirja: Is the short performance over now? If so, let's draw our fortune slips.\t[The term Mirja uses, koshibai, literally small play, refers to plays that were too small to be performed in theaters and were traditionally held at shrines.]\r\nMirja: Hm, mine reads \"great fortune\". That's how it is then.\r\nYui: You got a great fortune, Mirja-san? Since I'm a fortune drawing pro, I'll do it too!\r\nYui: There-! ...Wait, \"great misfortune\"!?\r\nYui: Wh-Wh-Wh-What do we do about this, Mirja-san!?\r\nMirja: Calm down, Yamashiro Yui. At this shrine, they have an offering box where you can deposit misfortune and great misfortune slips.\r\nMirja: After doing that, your great misfortune is meant to turn into great strength.\r\nYui: I'll go put my great misfortune in the box right away!\r\nMirja: If you run, you'll trip and fall.\r\nYui: Don't worry! A toji wouldn't trip-- WAGH-!?\r\nMirja: Just as I was telling you... Yamashiro Yui, is your leg alright?\r\nYui: Mirja-san is stroking my leg...! Is this my great strength already taking effect!?\r\nMirja: What are you even saying?\r\nMirja: ...Achoo. It's getting slightly colder, isn't it. After you've deposited your great misfortune slip, let's go warm ourselves up some.\r\nYui: Eh-!? You're going to warm me up... Where are you planning on taking me!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/apso0\r\n[New Year's Mirja: End]: Prayer\r\n\r\nMirja: Sweet sake truly does warm you up, doesn't it.\r\nYui: It sure does-. Sweet sake sure does warm you up-.\r\nMirja: ? What's the matter? You're making a strange face.\r\nYui: This is where I want you to say something like, \"You're so much more charming when you're smiling\"!\r\nYui: You got my hopes so high-. You got my hopes so high-! You got my hopes up that we were going to do something a lot more intense-!\r\nMirja: I apologize then, for not meeting your expectations.\r\nYui: You don't have to apologize~! I already knew all along it wouldn't be anything like that~!\r\nMirja: Alright then. Still, this sweet sake is delicious, isn't it?\r\nMirja: Would you like another cup, Yamashiro Yui?\r\nYui: Hey, that's no good, Mirja-san! What are you planning on doing to me, making me drink this much!\r\nMirja: I'm not going to do anything, and this sweet sake is made from malted rice, without the lees of actual sake, so it won't do anything to you either.\r\n\r\nMirja: Now then, why don't we get in line, now that it's grown shorter?\r\nYui: Sure! By the way, did you know this, Mirja-san? When you pray to god, it's supposed to be better if you state your name and home address, then make your wish.\r\nMirja: Is that true? You're well informed, Yamashiro Yui.\r\nYui: There's something I want to be granted no matter what. Whether I have to ask a god or anything for help, I'll try whatever I can.\r\nYui: So that's why, I looked up a lot of things.\r\nMirja: I see. I hope that wish of yours is granted then.\r\nYui: Yeah!\r\nYui: By the way, Mirja-san, are you going to pray for something? I can't even picture you praying to god for anything.\r\nMirja: I have wishes I want to be granted too. What exactly do you take me for?\r\nYui: Eh, but you don't have any flaws or weaknesses, do you, Mirja-san? That's why, if I had to say... You're a beautiful robot girl?\r\nYui: Ah, that sounds perfect actually! Your eyes are shiny and all!\r\nMirja: Could you not treat someone like they're a robot?\r\nYui: I'm just kidding! More importantly, please tell me what you're going to wish for!\r\nMirja: For the investigation team to accomplish their duties.\r\nYui: ...That's not really a wish, is it?\r\nMirja: Ahh, you have a point. Thinking on it, rather than a wish, it might be more of a promise I plan to impose on myself. \r\nYui: I like that about you too!\r\nMirja: I have high expectations that the investigation team will be able to become an even better team.\r\nYui: She just kept going!?\r\nMirja: I hope that this will be another good year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/9r9dv\r\n[New Year's Ellen: Start]: Hanetsuki Competition!\r\n\r\nKanami: The crowd of people here for their first shrine visit sure is huge.\r\nEllen: But it's also a part of the season here in Japan.

You don't have to hold my hand anymore. I won't get lost.\r\nMai: Ah, that's right. Sorry, I've been holding on all this time.\r\nSayaka: It's okay... Your hand was warm.\r\nKanami: Hey, Hiyori-chan, what'd you pray for?\r\nHiyori: To be in good health. What about you?\r\nKanami: Well, to meet more strong toji this year! That's what I wished for.\r\nHiyori: That sounds like something you'd do, but I guess there's nothing wrong with it.\r\nEllen: What should we do now? We could draw fortune slips, or get sweet sake; or a whole bunch of things!\r\nMai: Since I'm here at the shrine, I thought I would buy some protective charms for my family, then bring them back home.\r\nEllen: That sounds nice too. Hmm, I can't make up my mind. Isn't there some kind of special event you do at New Year's?\r\nKaoru: It's not really an event, but what if we do that?\r\nKanami: Ah! We could play hanetsuki! \t[Hanetsuki is a game similar to badminton, traditionally played at New Year's]\r\nEllen: Looks like fun! Let's do it!\r\nHiyori: I'll pass. You can have fun on your--\r\nKaoru: Don't you know, Eternal? Playing hanetsuki is considered an act of prayer for a girl's development.\r\nNene: Ne~?\r\nHiyori: ...!!\r\nKaoru: You sure you want to miss out? I guess it's only just a prayer, after all-.\r\nEllen: So then, Kanamin and I will be playing?\r\nHiyori: Wait, I'm playing too...!\r\nKaoru: ......Heh.\r\nKanami: If Hiyori-chan feels like playing, then I'll be the referee.\r\nSayaka: ...What will you do, Mai?\r\nMai: Let's see... I'll go pick out protective charms while I still can. If I let too much time go by, I think it'll be too crowded.\r\nSayaka: Then, I'll go too.\r\nMai: Okay. Let's get going then. We're going to go buy some charms for a bit, okay?\r\nKanami: Ah, alright! We'll see you later, Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan.\r\nEllen: Getting to compete with Hiyoyon like this is making me excited.

[Flat paddle used in hanetsuki]\r\nHiyori: Kaoru... Could you... Shut up-!\r\nEllen: How about this? HA-!!\r\nHiyori: ...Kh!\r\nKanami: That settles it; Ellen-chan's the winner.\r\nEllen: I did it! Hanetsuki's pretty fun~, isn't it.\r\nKaoru: As a rule, you're supposed to draw on the loser with black ink, but we haven't got any. Too bad...\r\nEllen: That reminds me, did you know about this?\r\nEllen: The hagoita is a tool you use for hanetsuki, but, a long time ago, it seems like it was customary to give them to girls on New Year's, as a charm to ward off misfortune.\r\nKanami: Huh-, so hagoita used to be used like that.\r\nEllen: So, Kanamin and Kaoru, are you going to be playing next?\r\nKaoru: Nah, I'm good.\r\nKanami: Ehh-. Kaoru-chan-, come on-.\r\nKaoru: Visiting a crowded shrine like this takes way more out of you than I expected. That's why, I've got to preserve my stamina, just in case.\r\nKanami: Ah, then to make up for it, we can have a match together some other time! Then I can spar against you, Kaoru-chan! Would that work?\r\nKaoru: Oi, why do we have to make up for it... Fine, I'll think about it. But only think about it.\r\nMai: We're back. Are you all taking a break?\r\nHiyori: Yeah. Or, actually, we might be done now.\r\nSayaka: You're done... playing hanetsuki?\r\nEllen: If you two feel like playing, then we can keep going. What do you think, Saaya?\r\nSayaka: I'm... fine with not playing.\r\nMai: I agree, I think I'm fine not playing too.\r\nEllen: In that case, next up, should we all go draw our fortune slips for the year?\r\nKanami: Ellen-chan, let's go check out the food stands after that!\r\nEllen: I was just thinking the same thing, Kanamin! You and I are on the same page.\r\nSayaka: Me too... I'm looking forward to the food stands.\r\nKanami: Ehehe. It's kind of nice, isn't it? Doing this kind of thing.

Do you see it on the spectrum finder?\r\nAradama: ...Ggii.\r\nSuzuka: There it is.\r\nSuzuka: (Rather than giving chase now with the two of us, it would be more effective to form a pincer attack. If these aradama are truly after the chocolate, then it shouldn't run to the other floors, but instead to the food court.)\r\nSuzuka: (There is only one route it can take to there. Our strategy should be for Kitora Mirja to circle around, and--)\r\nMirja: I'll circle around to the food court! Konohana Suzuka, you drive the aradama forward. As a precaution, I'll contact Kohagura and Tsubakuro as I move.\r\nSuzuka: !\r\nSuzuka: Good, I won't object to that.\r\nSuzuka: Destroying them is most important, however--\r\nAradama: ...GGGIII-!\r\nSuzuka: It won't make it so easy, will it.\r\nSuzuka: Though, even if you run, I'll guide your every move.\r\n\r\nAradama: GSHAA---!\r\nMirja: Just as planned. It's coming directly here.\r\nMirja: However, I won't so lenient as to let such a mindless charge through!\r\nSuzuka: Well done.\r\nMirja: Bringing it down was nothing. You had the more difficult role of guiding it here.\r\nSuzuka: It might have been on the run, but that aradama would have only gone to where the chocolate is located, so it was hardly a challenge.\r\nMirja: I see. Though, shouldn't you have been able to bring that aradama down?\r\nSuzuka: There are many things left unconfirmed about these aradama, so I decided to rely on the more certain method of a pincer attack. If you hadn't proposed the idea, I would have.\r\nSuzuka: I realize we are operating in two man teams during this mission, but it's been simple to carry out with how clear each other's intentions are.\r\nMirja: I felt the same. I can follow on your sensible instructions without hesitation. The elite guard must operate very smoothly.\r\nSuzuka: I never give detailed instructions to the elite guard.\r\nSuzuka: The primary role of the elite guard is to escort Yukari-sama, so when carrying out large scale operations, I and Maki-san will take command of our own units.\r\nMirja: Now that you mention it, that is certainly true. Hm...\r\nMirja: While we are on the topic of the elite guard, what sort of person is Shidou Maki? How do you see her?\r\nSuzuka: Eh? W-What do... you mean by that...?\r\nMirja: I have somewhat of an interest in Shidou Maki myself.\r\nMirja: I'm not sure if you are aware, but in the tournament the year before last, I was defeated by her.\r\nMirja: As I see her, she is a straightforward toji with a single-minded strength. Every one of her strikes had great force behind it.\r\nMirja: However, as someone who is close at her side, I was wondering if you had a different impression.\r\nSuzuka: Is that all you meant. Though, I don't think my impression differs much from yours? There's no hidden side to speak of when it comes to Maki-san.\r\nSuzuka: Well, if I had to name something, she can be quite dense at times.\r\nMirja: Is that so? She doesn't at all give that impression when fighting.\r\nMirja: Thank you for answering such a trivial question of mine.\r\nSuzuka: It was nothing.

You're spending your spare time helping us, aren't you?\r\nPatissier: It's probably because you're all so cute, but we're selling more chocolate this year than usual.\r\nSuzuka: Well now. In that case, I'll gladly learn what you have to teach me.\r\nPatissier: Then, we can do it after we close up for the day.

I'm a little hungry myself.\r\nYume: What should I have today~? Mont blanc? Or pudding a la mode... Mmm, I think I'll go with the strawberry rare cheesecake after all~.\r\nSuzuka: Strawberry is one of your favorites, isn't it, Yume. You like Ichigo Daifuku Neko as well, don't you?\r\nYume: Yeah, I guess it is~.\r\nSuzuka: Once you've finished eating, can I count on you to help us with managing the shop?\r\nSuzuka: I'll go ahead and get changed first.\r\nYume: Sure sure-.

This is how I always am.\r\nYume: Ehh, but I feel like something's different for sure-. Ah, maybe you got a special kind of cake!\r\nSuzuka: If I had gotten a cake like that, I would have shared it with you, Yume.\r\nYume: Hmm, I guess you would've. Then maybe I imagined it? But still...\r\nSuzuka: (I should have expected no less from Yume... She's so perceptive when it comes to the strangest things. I think it would be fine to tell her about being taught the tricks to making chocolate though.)\r\nSuzuka: (But, until Valenties day, I cannot allow Maki-san to find out.)\r\nSuzuka: (I'm only erring on the side of caution. Sorry, Yume.)\r\nSuzuka: (I'm sure the store's products would be more delicious, but I'm a bit interested in seeing Maki-san's reaction when I tell the chocolates I gave her are homemade.)\r\nSuzuka: Though, it is Maki-san after all. I'm sure she's no stranger to homemade chocolate.\r\nYume: What's that about Maki-onee-san?\r\nSuzuka: Nothing at all.

If you are unable to defeat Hirukomitama before it makes landfall, all will be lost.\r\nYukari: And, after you have destroyed Hirukomitama, you are to return here at once. Do you understand?\r\nYume: So, the important bits are, I just have to beat it real quick and come right back, right?\r\nYukari: Yes. That's all I can ask for. You understand as well, don't you, Asakura?\r\nMihono: Huh...? But, then, what about Tagitsuhime...\r\nYukari: I'm telling you, there is no time. We have no choice but to trust Etou and Juujou with Tagitsuhime.\r\nYukari: Etou and Juujou as they are now will surely destroy Tagitsuhime! You will fulfill your own role!\r\nMihono: I just have to trust Kanami and Juujou-san then... I got it...!\r\nYume: Kashuu Kiyomitsu onee-san, don't slow me down out there, okay!\r\nMihono: Don't worry about that... Right now, I'm pretty strong too!\r\nYume: ...Heh, if you say so!\r\nMai: Mihono-chan! Be careful, will you!\r\nSayaka: Do your best.\r\nKaoru: We're counting on you, Mihono...\r\nNene: Nenne-!\r\nEllen: Please come back safe, no matter what!\r\nMihono: Then, I'll be going!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4:\u3000Joint Struggle (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: ...This is, the threshold between our world and the netherworld... \r\nYume: Hey hey, where's that Hirukomitama?\r\nMihono: I'm not sure, but, Yukari-sama said Hirukomitama should be really big, so we should be able to see it right away...\r\nMihono: We're running out of time, so let's look for it fast!\r\nYume: Hey-, I'm the stronger one here, so don't tell me what to do...\r\nAradama: --GUUOOOOO!\r\nYume: Aradama!?\r\nMihono: But we don't have time to deal with all these...!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Joint Struggle (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Great-! My body feels light! I can cut through the aradama easy! If I can keep this up, the aradama won't be able to hold us back much at all!\r\nYume: I can't believe it-, you weren't lying after all. You really are strong, Onee-san.\r\nYume: The aradama here are way tougher than the ones on the ground too.\r\nMihono: Huh...? They are? It didn't feel like it to me...\r\nYume: I changed my mind a little. When we get back, maybe I'll want to have a match with you.\r\nMihono: Fine by me! But, before we can do that, we've gotta beat Hirukomitama! Let's look for it fast!\r\nYume: ...Wait, Onee-san! --Look over there! There's something weird!\r\nMihono: What is...!? No wait, that's...!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Hirukomitama (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: It disappeared!? What was that just now!? You saw that weird thing way over there, right!?\r\nYume: Onee-san! Behind you!!\r\nHirukomitama: .........\r\nYume: What is, that thing!?\r\nMihono: Maybe that's part of Hirukomitama...?\r\nYume: I get it now! It didn't just disappear... This place, what we're standing on, it's all Hirukomitama, so it can come out wherever it wants!\r\nMihono: Hirukomitama! We're here to destroy you!\r\nHirukomitama: .........\r\nYume: Sorry, but we're in a hurry here. Yukari-sama said we have to come back right away.\r\nMihono: We're gonna destroy you, to help out Kanami and Juujou-san!\r\nHirukomitama: .........\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Hirukomitama (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: What's with this thing... I doesn't feel like I'm doing any damage to it at all!\r\nHirukomitama: .........\r\nYume: What's wrong, Onee-san! You gonna start crying already!?\r\nMihono: I just felt like complaining a little! This isn't enough for me to give up yet!\r\nMihono: No matter how big its true body is, where there's a will, there's a way!\r\nYume: I think it might be a while since I've had this much fun! I'll show you! More and more, just what makes me so great!\r\nHirukomitama: .........\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Hirukomitama (3)\r\n\r\nHirukomitama: .........\r\nYume: Pant... Pant... Th-That was really tough...\r\nHirukomitama: .........\r\nMihono: We did it somehow, but it's still alive! If we don't finish it off fast--\r\nHirukomitama: .........\r\nMihono: Uwah-!! No! No no no-!! That's bad...!\r\nYume: We're getting blown back to the real world!\r\nMihono: Kanami! Juujou-san! NOOO----!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: The Depths of the Netherworld (1)\r\n\r\nAt that time, the fighting continued between Juujou Hiyori and Tagitsuhime--\r\n\r\nHiyori: Tagitsuhime...!\r\nTagitsu: Heh... So Yukari has returned to your world.\r\nKanami: --Hiyori-chaaaan!\r\nTagitsu: Hm...?\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: Kanami!? How did you manage fourth level jin'i!?\r\nKanami: I tried my hardest! I wanted to catch up to you, Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: You tried your hardest...?\r\nHiyori: Sure... That's about what I expect from you.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan! Tagitsuhime is...!\r\nTagitsuhime: --The time is now. ...Hirukomitama!!\r\nHiyori: Hirukomitama--!? Don't tell me, she's trying to combine with her true body in the netherworld!?\r\nHiyori: ...!? Something doesn't look right.\r\nTagitsu: Hmph... It seems we were unable to fully unite.\r\nTagisuhime: Well, no matter. Come, entertain me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: The Depths of the Netherworld (2)\r\n\r\nTagitsu: Chidori... Kogarasumaru girl. Yet again, you have made my heart dance.\r\nKanami: Tagitsuhime's body is...!!\r\nHiyori: She still had strength to spare...?\r\nTagitsu: You've done well for yourselves. Even with myself united with Hirukomitama... Yet still!\r\nHiyori: Let's go, Kanami! Together, we'll...\r\nKanami: Yeah! We'll save Tagitsuhime together!\r\nHiyori: Save... her?\r\nKanami: After all, Tagitsuhime said it again now, didn't she? Her heart was dancing. That means she's having fun, isn't she?\r\nTagitsu: How peculiar you are. Do you intend to remain locked here in this moment close to eternity, just to entertain me by clashing swords?\r\nKanami: That's not it; this is for my own enjoyment! Your swords will teach me it all! All about you!\r\nHiyori: You're saying Tagitsuhime is having fun with this fight...?\r\nKanami: Yeah! It's the same for me! Crossing okatana against okatana, getting to spar with everyone... It's all a conversation happening through our swords!\u3000\r\nHiyori: This is a conversation too...? So that's how you treat a sword, Kanami!\r\nTagitsuhime: Conversing by sword...?\u3000\r\nHiyori: Let's go!\r\nKanami: Mm!\r\nTagitsu: Very well. Entertain me as best you can, with this conversation through sword of yours!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: The Depths of the Netherworld (3)\r\n\r\nTagitsu: Grg...\r\nHiyori: ...Sorry, Kanami. I lied to you.\r\nHiyori: I have to take Tagitsuhime with me now, down to the depths of the netherworld.\r\nKanami: ...I knew you did.\r\nHiyori: Oh.\r\nKanami: That's why... Let's go together.\r\nHiyori: ...Thank you.\r\nKanami/Hiyori: --UOOOOOOOO!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: Seal\r\n\r\nYume: Urgh...\r\nMihono: ...We're, back on the roof...?\r\nMai: You two! You made it back okay!\r\nSayaka: Thank goodness.\r\nYukari: You've done well, you two.\r\nYume: ...Eh? But we didn't finish off Hirukomitama!\r\nKaoru: Oi, look up at the sky! Hirukomitama is going away...\r\nNene: Ne-...\r\nEllen: The gate to the netherworld is getting smaller...\r\nYukari: The gate is closing...!\r\nMihono: It's closing...? What does that mean!? Wait, wait! What about Kanami and Juujou-san!?\r\nYukari: I'm sorry...\r\nMihono: ...!! Was this what you planned... from the start!?\r\nYukari: Juujou and Etou... did their duty...\r\nMihono: Please just wait, Yukari-sama!! Kanami and Juujou-san, they can still--!!\r\nYukari: If we don't seal off the netherworld now, it would be a repeat of twenty years ago... Even if I were to devote my entire being as a toji to it!\r\nMihono: But, still! If that's the case, then why did I have to--!?\r\nYukari: If you would resent me for this... That's fine!\r\nYukari: Grant unto us, in all things, cleansing, purification, of wickedness, sin, and defilement...\r\nYukari: These wishes we most humbly entreat!\r\n\r\nMihono: Kanami... Juujou-san...\r\nYukari: ...Asakura, I'm grateful. Had you not defeated Hirukomitama, I wouldn't have been able to seal off the netherworld.\r\nMihono: -!? Th-Then... It's because of me, that Kanami and Juujou-san are...\r\nYukari: That's not it! It's because of you that the world was saved.\r\nKaoru: ...Goddamnit-!!\r\nSayaka: Ahh...\r\nMai: But...\r\nEllen: ...Kanamin... Hiyoyon...\r\nChie: --Everyone!\r\nMirja: If the gate to the netherworld has been closed, does that mean Tagitsuhime has been defeated!?\r\nKofuki: Oi, Mihocchi! Looks like you managed to help out some after all!\r\nKiyoka: -!? Yukari-sama is badly hurt!!\r\nSuzuka: Yukari-sama-! I'll call a rescue team straight away!\r\nSuzuka: For Yukari-sama to be wounded this badly... Still, you safely managed to defeat Tagitsuhime, didn't you?\r\nYui: ...Uh, I don't see Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan anywhere. Where did they go?\r\nYume: Those two, they're...\r\nYukari: ......\r\nMihono: ...Kanami... Even though we promised, we'd have a rematch someday...\r\nMihono: Even though, I never even managed to beat you a single time... I feel like, I might have a chance now... But now... But now!!\r\nMihono: KANAMIIIIIIIIIIII-!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: Mission Accomplished\r\n\r\nSana: The gate to the netherworld is nearly sealed! According to observations, its size is minimal!\r\nYuzuki: Please, Yukari...! Keep at it!\r\nSana: ......The sealing has been completed! They did it!\r\nYuzuki: Good! You did a fine job, Yukari! Our mission is complete!\r\nToji A: Asakura and Tsubakuro's vital signs have stabilized! ......But...\r\nYuzuki: But, what? What is it!?\r\nToji A: ...Etou and Juujous vitals, they haven't returned.\r\nYuzuki: What does that mean... What's happened to them!? Confirm the situation, immediately!"}, {"paste_key": "gFuh0xi1", "title": "Chain Story Archives Part 0.5.1", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/gFuh0xi1", "timestamp": "", "hits": "158", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/eWywEJpKhaA\r\n\r\n1: Unit One's Training Camp\r\n\r\nMinato: Sigh... Not much time left in our New Year's break, huh. I didn't get to mess around anywhere near as much as I wanted... Hey, Kagari, wanna go have some fun somewhere?\r\nKagari: Why would I go with you, Minato-senpai... Besides, I have my work to do for the Origami family, so no thank you.\r\nMinato: Ehh-, then what about if I invite Yukari too? That way you'd have to come along with us. When should we go? Hey-, when do you have some free time?\r\nKagari: (Sigh, she always forces things to go her way... Honestly, why does she feel the need to involve herself in others' business like this?)\r\nYukari: Minato, I hate to tell you this, but we won't have any time to enjoy ourselves. Starting tomorrow, at Yuzuki-senpai's proposal, we of Renpu Senior High School's Unit One will be undergoing a training camp.\r\nKagari: A training camp!?\r\n\r\nThe next day.\r\n\r\nFushimi Yuzuki: Seems like we're all here.\r\nMinato: Huh? But Ema and Iroha-senpai aren't here yet?\r\nYukari: The two of them are busy with a mission and won't be attending. I thought I told you that yesterday.\r\nMinato: Ahaha, you did? I might've been too distracted figuring out what snacks to bring to listen.\r\nKagari: (Sigh... She isn't showing an ounce of stress. Well, it's not as if Minato-senpai's the only one like that...)\r\nSagami Yukina: Sana, will you look at this! Aren't these pajamas so cute? I bought them just for today, after I heard I would be staying the night with Yukari-onee-sama~.\r\nArami Sana: Whoa-, that's super frilly... I bet it'd look great on you, Yukina-senpai.\r\nYukina: Wouldn't it~? Fufu, tonight I'll be sleeping in this, holding hands with Yukari-onee-sama~. I can't wait~!\r\nYukina: Hiiragi-san, just so you know, the futon next to Yukari-onee-sama belongs to me! I'm not letting you have it no matter what.\r\nKagari: Sigh... Sorry to spoil your fun, but Yukari-sama has said she will be sleeping in her own private room.\r\nYukina: What did you say!? Don't tell me, you're the one who put Yukari-onee-sama up to this...\r\nKagari: Yukari-sama decided upon it herself. And, I'll tell you just so you know, we aren't holding this training camp so you can amuse yourself.\r\nYukina: I don't need you to tell me that. Anyway, don't you think there are others you should be lecturing instead of me?\r\nKagari: Others I should be lecturing...?\r\nSana: Wow-, Minato-senpai. Look at all the snacks you're bringing! You think you could share some of that with me-?\r\nMinato: Hmm, then, how about we make a trade? You let me borrow that game you're bringing and it's a deal.\r\nSana: Eh-!? But I just bought this game! I was only bringing it 'cause I thought I'd be able to 100% it during the camp-!\r\nKagari: (Sigh... None of them are taking this seriously at all.)\r\nKagari: (This training camp is an important step in preparing our unit to be strong enough should a great disaster happen... Do they not understand our purpose here?)\r\nKagari: (No, they must understand it. It's just that, when the time comes, the weight of their duties isn't as heavy as the one I must do. That's why they can be so carefree...)\r\n\r\nMinato: Yukari, Yuzuki-senpai, here we go-! TAAAAAAA-!\r\nKagari: (I wasn't sure how things would turn out at first, but I should have expected this from Minato-senpai. The moment we began to practice, she became so serious it was like looking at a different person.)\r\nKagari: (Yukari-sama and Yuzuki-senpai too, with the way they can predict each other's movements, the upperclassman team is impressively coordinated. On the other hand...)\r\nYukina: Hey, Hiiragi-san! Sana! Why are you getting out ahead of me!?\r\nKagari: You're the one who's moving too slowly. If this were actual combat, that opening would absolutely come under attack.\r\nSana: Yeah, when it comes down to it, I'm not gonna hold back anything either.\r\nYukina: Hmph, trying to fight while working with you two is so stupid I'd rather not even try anymore.\r\nMinato: Ahaha-! It's like this every time; the three on the underclassman team are so out of sync it's hilarious.\r\nYuzuki: Yes, I've spotted the greatest issue for us to work through here.\r\nYukari: Right. During this camp, our greatest priority should be improving the teamwork of those three.\r\nYuzuki: I can think of a number of methods, but what do you think we should do for them to improve, Yukari?\r\nYukari: If you ask me, it would be best if we found a way to bring them closer using this camp environment during the brief time we have here...\r\nMinato: In that case, what if we put the underclassman team in charge of tonight's dinner? If they finish a common goal together, won't it deepen their friendship! You three feel the same, right?\r\nSana: Dinner duty!? Minato-senpai, isn't it more like you just thought it'd be a pain in the butt doing it yourself?\r\nKagari: The three of us, in charge of dinner? There's a limit to how inefficient you can make this. Since we went to the lengths of coming here, I believe we should spend our time doing more proper training exercises.\r\nYukina: I don't want to be with these two either. I thought I would finally get to spend 24 hours together with Yukari-onee-sama...\r\nYukari: Yukina, Sana, Kagari, this is an order from your captain. In order to improve your teamwork, you are to carry out this training at once.\r\nSana: If it's the captain's orders, I guess we don't have a choice but to go with it...\r\nKagari: Yes, once an order is given, we'll carry it out straight away. First, we'll need to do the shopping. Come on, Sagami-san, let's go.\r\nYukina: Could you not order me around? I'm only going because Yukari-onee-sama told me to.\r\nMinato: Can those three actually manage to get along for long enough to go shopping...?\r\nYuzuki: Being able to overcome that is another part of their training.\r\nYukari: That's right. Now that we've ordered them out, all we can do is wait and believe in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Dinner Cooking Fraught with Trouble\r\n\r\nKagari: Before we begin buying anything, I think we should first decide on a dinner menu, but what are you two best at cooking...\r\nKagari: Oh? Sana and Sagami-san must have left at some point. Where could they have gone...\r\nSana: Kagari-senpai, I went ahead and put what I want to eat in the shopping basket!\r\nKagari: Hang on, Sana, you can't only buy this many snacks. You won't be able to eat them all, will you?\r\nSana: It's all good. Sweets go in a different stomach, right? Besides, if we have to, Minato-senpai and me'll take responsibility and eat all of it!\r\nKagari: Really now... Do you know where Sagami-san went, by the way? I haven't seen her since we came in.\r\nSana: If you're looking for Yukina-senpai, she's over at the counter there.\r\nYukina: Fufufu~. Fish broiled in soy sauce, chopped burdock, spinach in tofu salad with white miso dressing; since Yukari-onee-sama loves Japanese style dishes, she'll be so happy.\r\nKagari: Wait, Sagami-san, aren't these all pre-packaged side dishes? The mission we were given was to work together, from buying the ingredients to cooking dinner. Just buying them pre-packaged is missing the point.\r\nYukina: Well, if I tried to work with you two, we'd never finish even if we had all the time in the world.\r\nKagari: But it's our objective here to do something about that. Let's first think up a menu together... Sana, please stop buying any more snacks.\r\nKagari: (Sigh... As disorganized as we are, can we even reach a finished dinner without incident? I'm concerned with what's coming next...)\r\n\r\nKagari: In the end, we never decided on a menu, and only bought ingredients for what each of us wanted to cook. Will this really be alright...\r\nSana: Huh? Yukina-senpai, you're so good with a knife! It's sorta surprising...\r\nYukina: A toji uses their okatana every day, so it's only natural.\r\nSana: Oh yeah. Then, let me try cutting some stuff too.\r\nSana: Wah-, that's crazy! Vegetables and fish both feel totally different when you cut them. Cooking's actually pretty fun when you give it a shot, huh, Kagari-senpai.\r\nKagari: Yes, I know... Wait, hold on, Sana, that fish you're cutting, that's the one I bought for the nimono I was making.\r\nSana: Eh-!? You should tell me that sooner-. I already chopped it down to bite size pieces.\r\nKagari: There's no use getting upset over what's already done. I'll have to come up with a new dinner menu... Using the ingredients I have left, I can... Eh?\r\nKagari: Sagami-san, right now, what you're cutting, that's the daikon radish I bought to use for making grated radish, isn't it?\r\nYukina: Oh, it was? My hands were free, so I thought I'd cut it. You should be thanking me then.\r\nKagari: But, when it's cut into such small bits, I can't make grated radish from it...\r\nYukina: So what!? If you're going to complain, then you should have put your name on it from the start.\r\nKagari: ...\r\nSana: Kagari-senpai, I just went and cut up the stuff that was around here, but what can I make with this?\r\nKagari: Sana, normally you decide on a menu before you begin cutting anything. Asking me to think of what you can cook in this situation is...\r\nYukina: Well now, look who's shying away. Isn't it your responsibility to bring this all together, Hiiragi-san?\r\nSana: Sorry, I also thought you'd be able to pull something together from this, Kagari-senpai... I guess it's no good after all?\r\nKagari: Unbelievable. You two rely on me far too much to get things done.\r\nMinato: Yikes-, it's looking even more tense in there than when the training camp started, isn't it.\r\nYuzuki: I'd planned on staying quiet and seeing how things progressed, but wouldn't it be best to step in soon?\r\nYukari: Still, if we simply help them out here, they won't have improved on anything. We should hold off a little longer...\r\n\t[Minato's stomach growls]\r\nKagari: Is somebody there? Please stop hiding and come out.\r\nMinato: Ahaha, you found me out, huh-. Sorry about that, we were just worried so we came to check up on you.\r\nYukari: You seem to be awfully at odds with each other, but do you think you can finish in time for dinner like we agreed on?\r\nKagari: About that...\r\nMinato: It's growling again. My stomach's so empty I just can't wait anymore-. Kagari-, if you don't make me some food soon, my stomach's gonna growl so hard it breaks.\r\nKagari: You say that, but... I can't come up with anything to make from these carelessly chopped up ingredients.\r\nYuzuki: You're right, I'm at a loss of what to do here. It'd be a challenge finding a menu that could make use of all these...\r\nMinato: You're kidding... But there's all this food in front of me-.\r\nMinato: Ahh-, I got it! I just came up with a crazy good idea!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The End Result of Dinner is...\r\n\r\nYuzuki: A good idea? Minato, what did you come up with?\r\nYukari: Did you think of some way to resolve this situation?\r\nMinato: Yep, yep. And here I'll show you how it's done!\r\nMinato: We'll take the ingredients here, every last one, and toss them in a hotpot!\r\nKagari: Hotpot...? I see.\r\nYuzuki: That's true, with a hotpot, we can cook a variety of ingredients together into something that tastes good.\r\nSana: Leave it to Minato-senpai!\r\nYukina: With a strong enough appetite helping her, even Minato-senpai can come up with a good idea sometimes.\r\nMinato: C'mon~, it wasn't that good.\r\nSana: Uh, Minato-senpai, that wasn't a compliment.\r\nYukari: At any rate, we don't have much time to prepare dinner, so starting now let's all work together regardless of class.\r\nKagari/Yukina/Sana: Right.\r\nYukari: Kagari, I'll be getting the broth together, so come help me.\r\nYukina: Yukari-onee-samaa, if you need help, I'll do it for youu~.\r\nKagari: I don't feel quite right leaving you in charge of the flavor. I know the way they make it in the Origami househould, so I'll help with this.\r\nYukina: What's with you!? I just want to cook with Onee-sama too, okay!\r\nMinato: Yukina, if you're free, come help me out. We'll chop up the leftover veggies together.\r\nYukina: Why do I have to be with Minato-senpai...\r\nYukari: Yukina, right now, what we need to do is cooperate to finish making dinner. Please go lend Minato a hand.\r\nYukina: If you're the one asking me, Onee-sama, then I'll do my best~.\r\nMinato: Hey, now you're looking motivated. So then, Yukina, let's have a contest to see who can chop them up the fastest!\r\nYukina: Why would we compete... Still, if that's how it is, then there's no way I'll lose.\r\nKagari: (Incredible, as soon as everyone decided on a goal and began to cooperate, the cooking is quickly coming along... That's the effect teamwork has...)\r\n\r\nMinato: Whoa-, there's a kotatsu waiting for us-!\r\nYuzuki: While everyone was preparing dinner, Sana and I got one ready. It looks like the hotpot is done too, so before we begin eating, let's hear an overview of today's efforts from our captain.\r\nYukari: You all did well our first day of the training camp. Our objective at this camp is to improve our teamwork, and...\r\n\t[Minato's stomach growls]\r\nMinato: Yukari-, I can't take it anymore! Can't we talk about this while we're eating? Let's eat already-.\r\nKagari: Minato-senpai. Honestly, you're so...\r\nYukari: Though, Minato may have the right idea here. Everyone, go ahead and eat up so you can be ready for tomorrow's practice.\r\nKagari/Yukina/Sana: Let's eat.\r\nMinato: Mmm~, so good~! You can't have winter without a hotpot, am I right?\r\nSana: Hafu, hafu*... That's right! Ah, the bits of radish Yukina-senpai chopped up all small soaked up the flavor and taste really good.\t[*The sound people make while eating something good, but hot, trying to breathe in through their mouth to cool it down. Onomatopoeia is hard.]\r\nYukina: Of course they do, because I'm the one who chopped them up. Hafu, hafu... Oh, these slices of fish are delicious too!\r\nKagari: Those would be the fish Sana chopped up by mistake. It turned out for the best not using it to make nimono.\r\nSana: Eheheh, I guess I was right for getting it wrong then.\r\nMinato: Wait-, the three on the underclassman team, they're acting all close out of nowhere digging into the hotpot.\r\nYuzuki: It's hard to imagine the tense atmosphere they had earlier.\r\nYukari: As they say, those who eat out of the same pot stay close. I'm relieved to see the training camp is already producing results.\r\nMinato: (Oh, I'm glad that Yukari-sama is feeling relieved. I wasn't sure if we would make it for a moment, but we were saved this time thanks to Minato-senpai's idea.)\r\nKagari: (Thinking on it more, even outside of battle, Minato-senpai helps us out, doesn't she.)\r\nKagari: (I don't exactly wish to admit it, but, Minato-senpai might be an amazing person after all...)"}, {"paste_key": "u5MX9w5T", "title": "Renpu High Yukari Episode", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/u5MX9w5T", "timestamp": "", "hits": "67", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://streamable.com/wuarv\r\n[Renpu High: Start]: Marshmallows\r\n\r\nMinato: Yukari, Kagari, morning-!\r\nYukari: Morning, Minato.\r\nKagari: Good morning.\r\nMinato: You gotta hear this! Last night, I had this awesome dream-! In my dream, we were all a part of the tournament...\r\nMinato: But the white gravel at the tournament grounds had all turned into marshmallows, so we couldn't do it, and then we just decided to eat them all!\r\nKagari: Sigh... I shouldn't be surprised, Minato-senpai. Even your dreams don't make any sense...\r\nMinato: I mean, it was such a crazy dream that I felt like I had to tell you as soon as possible! You know how it is, right? Hey, Yukari, what kinda dream did you have last night?\r\nYukari: My dream last night... I think I had one...\r\nYukari: Ah...!\r\nKagari: Yukari-sama? What is it?\r\nYukari: It's nothing. Look, school is starting. Let's go to our classrooms.\r\nMinato: What that was about. Yukari was acting a little weird, wasn't she?\r\nKagari: Was she? Anyway, if we don't hurry, we'll be late. Really now, this is all your fault for launching into some long and pointless story about your dreams, Minato-senpai...\r\nMinato: Sorry about that. But still, wouldn't it be funny if that dream ended up coming true~?\r\n\r\nIn a break between classes.\r\n\r\nMinato: Ah~, I'm starving. I can't believe it's still only 2nd period.\r\nYukari: Minato. So you were over here.\r\nMinato: Yeah, I was hungry, so I thought I'd buy some bread from the school store. Why're you here, Yukari?\r\nYukari: No reason, really. We have music class next, don't we? Let's go together.\r\nMinato: O-Okay...\r\n\r\nAfter school that day.\r\n\r\nMinato: Ah~, I can't be bothered today, so maybe I'll skip practice and take an afternoon nap.\r\nYukari: Minato, you came out here to skip practice again...\r\nMinato: Sorry about that, Yukari. I'll try extra hard in practice starting tomorrow, so give everyone my regards~!\r\nYukari: Wait. If you won't be coming to practice, I'll do self-training at my household too, so let's leave together.\r\nMinato: Eh-- You will!?\r\nKagari: What's going on, Yukari-sama? You're skipping practice along with Minato-senpai?\r\nYukari: There's no real reason for it. I just thought it would be nice for us to walk home together for once. Come on, Kagari, Minato. Let's go.\r\nKagari: There's something strange about Yukari-sama today, isn't there?\r\nMinato: That's what I'm saying. It always feels like I'm the one sticking close to Yukari, but today it's like it's the other way around... I wonder what happened... Nn-, I wanna know!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/47tku\r\n[Renpu High: End]: Dream Come True\r\n\r\nMinato: Ahh~, the three of us skipping practice and going home together feels all fresh and exciting! Want to stop by somewhere?\r\nKagari: Yukari-sama and I will be practicing as soon as we return to the Origami household. Please don't treat us like your accomplices, Minato-senpai.\r\nMinato: Come on, don't be such a stick in the mud~. We never go home early together! There's this super cool secret spot I found that I'll show you.\r\nYukari: Secret spot? And where is that?\r\nMinato: You'll have to wait and see. C'mon, let's go!\r\n\r\nMinato: You two are so slow~. If you keep it up, the sun's gonna go down~!\r\nKagari: Pant, pant. You're taking us up quite the mountain trail.\r\nYukari: Minato, can't we leave it at this and go home for today? I have a strange feeling about this.\r\nMinato: Hey, Yukari, what's this feeling about anyway? You've been acting kinda weird since this morning. Come on and tell us.\r\nYukari: ...\r\nMinato: If you just explain things, I'll hear you out, okay?\r\nYukari: I might just be getting afraid over nothing, but, this morning, I had a strange dream.\r\nYukari: Up in a mountain, there was this mysterious shrine I had never seen before. You went running up the steps to it, Minato... And then, the moment I took my eyes off you, you vanished.\r\nKagari: As in... She was spirited away?\r\nYukari: I can't say that for sure, but I woke up with this feeling of unease, and it's worrying me.\r\nMinato: Alright, I get it now! It's true that, unlike my dream, this one sounds like it could actually happen.\r\nKagari: Minato-senpai, given what Yukari-sama is saying, can we not stop here today and go back?\r\nMinato: Hmm, you have a point. If Yukari's that sure about it... \r\nMinato: I know! Won't everything be fine if I just don't go on ahead like I did in Yukari's dream?\r\nMinato: I'll stay right with you every step of the way, alright? Since we already came this far, you'll definitely be missing out if you don't see it now! Okay?\r\nYukari: If you insist, Minato... Fine then, let's go see.\r\nMinato: You've got to! Don't worry; so long as the three of us are together, no matter where we go, we'll make it through!\r\n\r\nMinato: Okaaay, here we are!\r\nYukari: This is...\r\nKagari: I didn't think cherry blossoms could still be in bloom somewhere at this time of season...\r\nMinato: This place is hidden away on the north side of the mountain, so it doesn't get much sun, which means the cherry blossoms bloom later than usual.\r\nYukari: I'm surprised you managed to find a place like this.\r\nMinato: I saw it in a dream I had. There were all these cherry blossoms blooming on the north side of a mountain. So I got interested, and when I came to check it out, I found this!\r\nKagari: You mean, your dream came true then?\r\nMinato: Yep. If Yukari's dream came true, that'd be scary, but I'm glad a fun dream like this one was real!\r\nYukari: That's for sure. I hope we can be spared Minato getting spirited away or the gravel turning to marshmallows, but I'm very glad to see a dream like this come true."}, {"paste_key": "qTTsU3C1", "title": "Smash Through! Sports Chanbara Joint Training", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/qTTsU3C1", "timestamp": "", "hits": "99", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/Q0k7SGHuyNM\r\n\r\n1: Joint Training Always Comes When You Least Expect!?\r\n\r\nKanami: Why do you think they called all the toji who weren't on missions to meet here? Mai-chan, do you know?\r\nMai: Since they've gathered up students from all the Five Traditions, maybe it's some kind of practice drill? Ah, Shidou-san came out.\r\nMaki: This may be sudden, but we've decided to use this period of your summer vacation to improve your command of tactics.\r\nSuzuka: Given the nature of this exercise, non-toji students who are involved in operations planning will also be participating.\r\nMaki: With that out of the way, the subject of this training exercise is sports chanbara. I'll now explain the rules and rewards.\r\nMaki: You will randomly assigned to team of five, and designated to fight one other team. The winning team will be given complimentary pool tickets.\r\nKanami: Mai-chan, we get to go to the pool! Let's try real hard!\r\nMai: Regardless of who wins or loses, it would be nice to all go have some fun together there. It's our summer vacation, after all.\r\nKanami: Yeah, that sounds good! But, if we're competing, I really do want to win.\r\nMai: Mm. I know what you mean!\r\nMaki: The basic rule is \"You can hit anywhere, but get hit anywhere and you're out.\" Since non-toji students will be participating, you won't be using okatana, but these foam swords instead.\r\nMaki: Also, the use of the combat abilities utsushi, jin'i, kongoushin, hachimanriki, and of course the sensory abilities myougan and toukaku, are banned as well.\r\nMaki: You're free to fight your opposing team fair and square, or sweep them with a surprise attack. It's up to whatever plan your team decides on.\r\nMaki: Victory goes to whichever team has less members eliminated by strike out when the time limit is reached.\r\nMaki: However, if a team with a non-toji member is able to protect them until they end, that person will be worth double.\r\nMaki: That about does it explaining the point of the excercise.\r\nSuzuka: Now then, I will provide some additional information to Maki-san's explanation.\r\nSuzuka: Unlike ordinary sports chanbara, you will not be limited to a specified court, but only required to stay in sighting range of your allies.\r\nSuzuka: Also, if either of the team's leaders do not notify the administrators by message at the start of a battle, the battle will not be recognized as official.\r\nSuzuka: We need to be able to start your fifteen minute time limit.\r\nSuzuka: Lastly, students who are struck out will be forbidden from offering advice or other assistance. Right now, the rules that Maki-san and I have gone over are being sent to your phones, so please examine them at your own leisure.\r\nMaki: In a few minutes, the team assignments should also be messaged to you. Group up, and be ready for the training exercise to begin in one hour.\r\n\r\nMai: Hiyori-chan, Iwakura-san, Mihono-chan, Tsugumi-san, and myself. I think our team has a nice balance to it.\r\nTsugumi: With this formation of members, I can work as a support. I should be most useful that way.\r\nMihono: I'm so glad-, it's all people I know!\r\nMai: I think you'd be able to get along well with just about anybody though, Mihono-chan.\r\nSanae: I've never really gotten a chance to do these sort of team battles with Juujou-san, but I'm looking forward to it.\r\nHiyori: Yeah, it's reassuring being on your team, Iwakura-san.\r\nMai: Then, why don't we decide on a strategy, or plan of action for our team.\r\n\r\nKanami: We get to fight all sorts of toji in these team battles... I wish we could do this kind of practice every month!\r\nEllen: You really look like you're enjoying yourself, Kanamin. It all starts in another thirty minutes, so let's have a strategy meeting.\r\nKanami: Okay. Since it's an encounter battle, it'd be great if we had a way to know what kind of movements our opponents will be making.\r\nMirja: This was explained earlier, but protecting the students who are not toji is critical.\r\nMirja: As one of them, what are your thoughts on that point, Mizushina Kinuka?\r\nKinuka: Before we get to that, let me give a little introduction. I'm Mizushina Kinuka, a third year in Ayanokouji's high school division. I normally work at the STT headquarters as a strategic staff officer.\r\nKinuka: I'm not sure I can help much with the fighting itself, but I'll do what I can. I think if I move along with you, it'll be useful for reference in the future. Oh, and by the way, I'm a friend of Mirja's.\r\nEllen: Good to have you aboard, Kinuka.\r\nKanami: Nice to meet you-!\r\nYui: Don't you worry about having to fight, Kinuka-san. I, Yamashiro Yui, will lay my life on the line to see you unharmed!\r\nKinuka: Thank you, Yamashiro-san. So anyway, about what Mirja asked before--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Feeling of a Serious Battle!\r\n\r\nStage Directions: Somewhere in Kanagawa prefecture-- Two teams are in the midst of battle.\r\n\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan-- We've already gotten started fighting Itomi-san and Kaoru-san's team. Please get your foam swords ready!\r\nFujimaki Minaki: That's right, Kofukicchi. It's a team battle, so if you don't help us out, we're done for.\r\nKofuki: Some aradama-chan'd be better than whacking each other with these squishy things... You guys'll manage.\r\nSayaka: Kaoru, do you not want to go to the pool?\r\nKaoru: I do, but... Practice, work, manual labor... The moment I start thinking about those, my body gets too heavy to move... Sorry, Sayaka.\r\nKaoru: But, I'll be cheering you on. You can do it-, Sayaka-.\r\nSayaka: I understand. I'll try to do it...\r\nUraga Nao: You're fine with that, Itomi-san!?\r\nKofuki: Tch... Getting my ass kicked for nothing by Sayaka would be annoying too... Chichie, I'll pin her down.\r\nChie: Okay! ...Hey, and my name isn't Chichie!\r\nNao: Mashiko-san, you get in formation too~... I'm begging you~.\r\n\r\nKinuka: Let's review our strategy while we move. The basic aim is to protect me until we reach the time limit.\r\nKinuka: Naturally, if we can have our talented fighter, Etou-san, keep up a relentless attack and match our opponent's offensive, I think it will likely lead to our victory.\r\nKinuka: But it will mean you'll end up taking on multiple enemies.\r\nKanami: I'm not too sure about that, so I'll have to think a lot about how to attack.\r\nKinuka: We could also try gambling on a riskier strategy, like using me as bait so you can eliminate those who attack me. That might be effective if the enemy is hiding.\r\nEllen: But, the penalties are way too big if we lose you, Kinuka. It's better to keep you safe. That's twice the points for us.\r\nYui: Yep, keeping cute girls safe-- That's my mission here!\r\nMirja: We leave her in your hands, Yamashiro Yui. If you maintain a strong defense, it won't be difficult overcoming a numerical disadvantage.\r\nMirja: Kohagura Ellen and myself will of course be in the area as guards, but there will be times we have to move out to attack as well.\r\nEllen: We'll be switching up our attack on the fly.\r\nEllen: Yuiyui is in charge of protecting Kinuka. Kanamin is in charge of the offense. Let's all make it work! If we all combine our efforts, we'll take the win and those pool tickets before you know it!\r\nKinuka: Remember, you aren't fighting with okatana, so it's one hit from these foam swords and you're out. Please be careful.\r\nKanami: I go it! So, what are we doing from here?\r\nKinuka: As you might expect... We'll go in with the element of surprise!!\r\nYui: Ooh, you're so aggressive, Kinuka-san!\r\nMirja: The opposing team we were assigned is Juujou Hiyori and Yanase Mai's. I think that is a better strategy than waiting for them.\r\nEllen: Let's make like an early bird and go get the worm!\r\n\r\nMai: Even if she doesn't have an okatana, Kanami-chan is sure to come at us with everything she has.\r\nSanae: Mmhm. From looking at their members, I think Etou-san will be the one to push an attack.\r\nSanae: Yanase-san, Juujou-san, I want to make sure with you. Will the two of you be able to take out Etou-san?\r\nSanae: Or, at least keep her held down?\r\nMai: I think we can hold her down. Right, Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: Yeah. It's just, I don't think I'll be used to fighting with these soft foam swords. Though, they should have the same issue.\r\nTsugumi: The moment you're hit, you're eliminated. You need to be careful.\r\nHiyori: Mihono, you'll be careful, right?\r\nMihono: Why me!? Um... I think I'll be fine?\r\nMihono: Ahaha... I'd like to be able to go and play with Chii-nee and everyone at the pool!\r\nHiyori: We have to win first to make that happen, don't we...?\r\nSanae: Hey now, having the right motivation is important too. Isn't it, Asakura-san?\r\nMihono: Yeah, that's it! Motorbation...! I wanna win too!\r\nMai: I think attacking as quickly as we can before they notice us would give us the highest chance of victory, but what do you think?\r\nMai: Our priority target should be our senpai, the third year high schooler from Ayanokouji.\r\nTsugumi: So then, we'll go with a surprise attack?\r\nMihono: I want to fight Kanami fair and square, but we can do that some other time...!  Cause I want that pool ticket!\r\nKanami: Ah, I spotted Mihono-chan! And Mai-chan and Hiyori-chan too!\r\nMihono: Geh... Kanami!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: A Small Move Done Secretly\r\n\r\nKanami: I thought I heard Mihono-chan talking, but I didn't expect them to be this close by.\r\nMirja: It was so blatant that I assumed they were using Asakura Mihono as a decoy, but it seems I was wrong.\r\nMihono: Fwhe!?\r\nEllen: So much for our surprise attack-. Mirja, are we okay to go?\r\nMirja: Yes, I sent a message to the administrators that Etou Kanami has encountered the corresponding team.\r\nSanae: They're messaging to start the battle...! Yanase-san?\r\nMai: Mihono-chan and I will go after that senpai... [whispered]\r\nMihono: Ah, sure! [whispered]\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui.\r\nYui: I'm already on it! Our hearts are connected, Mirja-san!\r\nSanae: Juujou-san, you take Etou-san. Ban-san, please back me up.\r\nTsugumi: Sure thing-, I'll be right with you.\r\nHiyori: That's how we're doing it. I'll be your opponent, Kanami.\r\nKanami: It's different from a sparring match, but this is fun too! Here I come, Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: (I'll draw Kanami away-- Good luck, you two.)\r\n\r\nEllen: I'm not letting you go one step further, Maiiimai.\r\nMai: Ellen-chan... Are you sure Kanami-chan will be fine on her own?\r\nEllen: Fufu. That's a risk I'm willing to take. --HAA-!\r\nMirja: Where do you think you're going? Asakura Mihono.\r\nMihono: Um, uhh... I thought I'd play with Yui a little...?\r\nMihono: --Hey, Mirja-san!? You're going to attack without even saying anything!?\r\nMai: Mihono-chan, create some distance!\r\nEllen: --You're open!\r\nMai: ...!?\r\n\r\nYui: Ahh-, two groups of girls meeting for a heated sweaty battle! I bet it smells great!\r\nKiyoka: And, out of everyone... Why are you acting like you're just a spectator? Though, given the situation, I suppose I'm one too...\r\nYui: I thought I'd help you relax, Kinuka-san. I'm also at my strongest when my body gets all heated up!\r\nYui: Whoa-, Kanami-chan! She isn't backing down one step! Watching toji go at it makes me fall in love with fighter girls all over again-.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: --HAA!!\r\nKanami: Whoa, that was close-...!\r\nHiyori: Think you're safe now...? YAA!\r\nKanami: I'm pulling back for a minute!\r\nTsugumi: I'm somewhat baffled by her dodge then... I was sure I was in her blind spot.\r\nSanae: Maybe we should have expected it... Or we should come up with some counter strategy, shouldn't we.\r\nKanami: This is fun, but we can't keep it going forever-- Time to decide this!\r\n\r\nMihono: (Now!)\r\nMihono: YAA!\r\nKinuka: ...Hyaa-!\r\nMihono: Yuii...\r\nYui: That's right, because I'm Kinuka-san's knight in shining armor right now-. I'll punish any ruffian who comes near-!\r\nMihono: Sorry, Mai. I couldn't finish it quick.\r\nMai: We still have time, so don't panic yet, Mihono-chan.\r\nEllen: Kinuka, can I borrow your ear for a sec? ...whisper whisper whisper...\r\nEllen: Like that!\r\nKinuka: ! ...I get it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Even a Baby Tiger Can Still Bite, You Know?\r\n\r\nKanami: There!\r\nTsugumi: Ah-, she got me.\r\nKanami: I landed a hit on Tsugumi-san! Only four left!\r\nHiyori: Maybe it's because we aren't using okatana, but I can't get a handle on this... Though, it's no use saying that.\r\nHiyori: Iwakura-san, we'll attack her at the same time. If it goes wrong, I'm counting on you.\r\nSanae: Good idea. I'll count on you too, Juujou-san.\r\nSanae: --Let's go then!\r\nKanami: You two are getting serious, huh!\r\nHiyori: YAA!\r\nSanae: Sorry about this, Etou-san-- HAA!\r\nKanami: ...! I'm not about to lose, though!\r\nSanae: You won't get me so easy either... See!\r\nKanami: Kh, I'm getting completely... blocked out here.\r\nKanami: (They're not giving me... Much room to work with. But--!)\r\nSanae: ...Ah.\r\nKanami: Now it's just a fight between me and Hiyori-chan--\r\nSanae: ...!\r\nSanae: (Juujou-san... It's all on you!)\r\nHiyori: I know-- And it's over, Kanami.\r\nKanami: !?\r\nKanami: Ah-, she got me-. I got too focused on Iwakura-san that I couldn't react elsewhere.\r\nHiyori: I'm going to go back up Mai and Mihono.\r\nSanae: Mm, take care of the rest.\r\nKanami: Hey, Iwakura-san. Would you mind... sparring with me with okatana some other time?\r\nSanae: Sure, if you'll have me. I heard about it from Juujou-san, but you really do love swordfighting, don't you.\r\nKanami: Thanks; I just like to see how all kinds of different people sword fight.\r\n\r\nMihono: Iwakura-san and Tsugumi-san got taken out...\r\nMai: We're still okay, Mihono-chan! They managed to bring down Kanami-chan, so we still have a chance.\r\nMai: (But, as for time... there might not be much left.)\r\nMirja: I won't let you come any further.\r\nMihono: (Right now, I'm the only one who has a chance to go after Mizushina-san--!)\r\nKinuka: ...!\r\nYui: Okaay-, there's no touching allowed here-.\r\nMihono: Ahh-, geez~! \r\nYui: Don't be afraid, Kinuka-san! Yamashiro Yui is always at your side!\r\nKinuka: That's... still a bit scary in its own way.\r\nEllen: You'll have to deal with us first, Mihomiho.\r\nHiyori: Is that so. Then, let me join in, Ellen.\r\nEllen: We haven't found each other much before, Hiyoyon, but I'm not about to lose.\r\nEllen: So long as I'm standing, I'll protect Kinuka, absolutely!\r\nHiyori: I don't feel like losing either. --HAA!\r\nEllen: Oh! I should have expected, Hiyoyon moves so fast I can't keep up with her-.\r\nEllen: Mirja, Yuiyui, Kinuka. The rest is up to you.\r\nHiyori: Mihono, if you strike that senpai from Ayanokouji, it's our win!\r\nMihono: I know that, but... Where'd Mizushina-san go??\r\nMai: Mihono-chan... Look out!\r\nKinuka: ...There-!\r\nMihono: ...Huh!?\r\nMirja: Ah...! Yamashiro Yui... Guard Mizushina Kinuka right now!\r\nYui: I-I'm on it... Mirja-san!\r\nYui: That was way too risky; don't scare me like that~. Though, I love an older girl who can be a little daring!\r\nKinuka: Strategizing does need us to be daring at times...\r\nMirja: However, it seems it was unnecessary after all. Having reached the time limit, this is our victory.\r\nMihono: No wayyy~, this is hard to swallow for a bunch of reasons!\r\nMai: I know. I never expected that Mizushina-san might go on the offensive...\r\nKanami: I had no clue about it either-.\r\nMirja: I wasn't aware of it as well. That may be exactly why she was able to strike where you least expected.\r\nTsugumi: She lives up to her reputation as a strategic staff officer at STT HQ.\r\nKinuka: ......\r\nSanae: We were doing fairly well for ourselves, but their strategy proved better in the end.\r\nHiyori: Right, at that moment, I was stuck on the spot.\r\nKinuka: I'm happy for all the compliments, but the one who came up with the idea itself was Kohagura-san.\r\nEllen: I was sure you'd come through, Kinuka.\r\nKinuka: She told me that, when the time limit approached and the battle turns into a free for all, they'd never expect me to attack, so it could work if I came up behind them.\r\nKinuka: When she told me, I was pretty shocked myself, but it sounded good for one last secret tactic, so I stuck with it.\r\nKanami: So Ellen-chan came up with it; that's amazing! But, I kinda wish you would have let us in on it...\r\nEllen: Sorry, Kanamin. We had to outmaneuver our opponents, see. And that starts by outmaneuvering your allies.\r\nEllen: Still, it doesn't change the fact that Kinuka did all the work.\r\nMirja: I do understand the need to take a risk during battle to accomplish your objective. Though, the possibility that Mizushina Kinuka herself would be taken out was high.\r\nEllen: Well also, I thought Kinuka might get bored just being guarded all the time.\r\nKinuka: ...I thought my heart was going to stop, it was pounding so hard. Which was also fun in a way, but it helped me understand what those of you out carrying out our operations go through. You girls in the field sure have it rough...\r\nEllen: Now then, let's all head back to school, so we can collect our pool tickets!\r\nEllen: There's still plenty more fun to be had this summer vacation-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Summertime With Everyone!\r\n\r\nKanami: Ellen-chan, come see this!\r\nKanami: I looked into it a little, and they have different kinds of water slides there! Wow, which should we try first!\r\nEllen: Looks like they range from ones for kids, to high thrill slides that advertise the sense of speed. This one's the type where you slide down on a rubber boat, isn't it?\r\nEllen: Ah, Saaya's here! Is Kaoru with you?\r\nSayaka: ...She came with me.\r\nKaoru: Leisure's one of my strong suits. There's no way I was gonna be late.\r\nKanami: Let's do all kinds of fun stuff together today! Mai-chan and Hiyori-chan and them didn't manage to win free tickets, but they said they'll be coming to the pool anyway, so it'll be a ton of fun for sure!\r\nSayaka: I'm looking forward to it a lot.\r\nEllen: Did you get everybody together too, Mirja?\r\nMirja: Yes. I believe everyone who isn't already here should have boarded the bus we arranged on.\r\nYui: Summertime filling your chest with anticipation!! Girls with bright beaming smiles! What is it about swimsuits that makes a girl so irresistible?\r\nYui: Do you think I could turn that in for my summer research project, Mirja-san?\r\nMirja: I think it's sure to be rejected. Though, if you could somehow gather objective data, it's possible.\r\nMirja: Don't go photographing anyone without their permission, Yamashiro Yui.\r\nYui: Of course I wouldn't do that! If I were going to take photos of anybody, I'd be sure to get their permission first! I'd want them smiling my way after all!\r\nMirja: Well, if you'll be getting their permission, then I suppose it's fine...\r\nKinuka: Ah-, since we're all going, I should've brought my little sister with me...\r\nKinuka: Though, since Waka-chan's so cute, if she came to a place like this, she'd be hit on for sure... They can't lay a finger on my treasure-- No! Come within a 5 meter radius of her...!!\r\nYui: Little sisters are a thing to be treasured! That's the truth of the world!\r\nKinuka: Do you... have a little sister too?\r\nYui: I do!\r\nKinuka: Yamashiro-san... Little sisters, they're little angels, aren't they? I can only thank god for making me an older sister!\r\nYui: I know what you mean! They're made of solid cuteness!\r\nEllen: Then, you two, shouldn't we try all kinds of fun things here now so you know what to do when you come with your sisters?\r\nKinuka/Yui: --That's it!!\r\n\r\nEllen/Yui/Kinuka: KYAAAAAAA!!\r\nEllen: YAHOOOOOO! The rushing water feels great, doesn't it--...!\r\nEllen: Ahaha! We came shooting out of there pretty fast-.\r\nKinuka: That was quite the thrill, there...\r\nEllen: That's what makes it so exciting!\r\nYui: Ahhhh... Sandwiched between two beautiful ladies, I can't take ittt..!\r\nKinuka: Yamashiro-san... Are you alright...?\r\nEllen: You don't have to worry about Yuiyui. Anway, you two... Want to go for one more?\r\nKinuka: In that case, why don't we try another one?\r\nYui: I'll follow wherever you ladies lead me-!\r\nEllen: That's the spirit! The day's only just getting started, so let's enjoy it to our heart's content!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/eNoknnmG1eI\r\n[Kanami: Start]: Please, Mai-chan!\r\n\r\nKanami: Let's go to the pool together, Mai-chan!\r\nKanami: You know about our next day off...? Well, it sounds like everybody else doesn't have to do any missions then either!\r\nMai: That's a real stroke of luck!\r\nKanami: I know! I couldn't believe it either.\r\nKanami: So, I was thinking, I want to go to the pool with everybody that day... Do you have any other plans then, Mai-chan?\r\nMai: Nope, I'm free to go. I'll look forward to it.\r\nKanami: Yeah!\r\n\r\nKanami: We're almost at the pool!\r\nMai: We're probably the only ones arriving here this early... Aren't we?\r\nMai: It's a little unfortunate everyone couldn't all make it at the same time.\r\nKanami: But still, everyone will be here by the afternoon... And Yui-chan and Tsugumi-san should get here soon!\r\nKanami: While we wait for them, let's have some fun together!\r\nMai: Sure!\r\nKanami: Though, what can we do with the two of us?\r\nKanami: I'd be alright with just swimming, but... With two of us, it'd definitely turn into a competition.\r\nMai: And also, that wouldn't be any different from PE class.\r\nKanami: That's true... Then, what about something like, going against the current in the river pool? Yeah! That could be a great full body exercise!\r\nMai: Aren't you just looking to do more training, Kanami-chan!? Didn't we come here to enjoy ourselves today?\r\nKanami: Ah... That's just where my mind started going to... Sorry, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: It's nothing to apologize over. It's very like you, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: Come up with something good for me, please!\r\nMai: Fufu, I'll give it a shot!\r\nMai: Let's see, something fun that's not connected to training... Ah!\r\nMai: Kanami-chan, let's go down a water slide!\r\nKanami: We're starting off with a water slide!?\r\nMai: Yep!\r\nMai: I don't think many people will be on those this time of day, so we should be able to get right to the front of the line!\r\nKanami: Oh yeah! Good thinking, Mai-chan!\r\nKanami: Alright! As soon as we get to the pool, we'll go down a water slide!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Kanami: End]: A Heartpounding Water Slide!?\r\n\r\nAttendant: Okay, the next person can come on up-. Are the two of you riding together? Or will you go separately?\r\nKanami: Oh, we can ride down together.\r\nKanami: What should we do, Mai-chan?\r\nMai: Hmm... Since we have the chance, why don't we go together?\r\nKanami: Sounds good!\r\nAttendant: You'll be riding together then-. In that case, please climb on board this rubber boat-.\r\nMai: ...!!\r\nMai: The boat is a lot smaller than I was expecting... We might have to be right up against each other.\r\nKanami: You think so? I guess it's like this?\r\nKanami: Here, I'll ride up front!\r\nMai: A-Alright... And, do I have to sit here...?\r\nKanami: If you don't sit there, how are you going to ride it down? Come on, get on!\r\nMai: Y-You're right... Mm, I won't be able to ride it otherwise... Mm.\r\nMai: ...I'm getting on then.\r\nAttendant: Excuse me-, could the two of you get a bit closer together-?\r\nMai: We need to be even closer!?\r\nKanami: Sure thing-. You heard them, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: Ehh!? I-Is that really okay!?\r\nKanami: Come on, wrap your arms around my stomach.\r\nMai: A-Alright then. In that case...\r\nKanami: ...!? Ahahahaha! Th-That tickles, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: Ahh!? Sorry, I didn't mean to, Kanami-chan!?\r\nAttendant: There are places to hold onto the boat, so you can hang onto there instead-.\r\nMai: Oh, there are...\r\nKanami: We messed it up, huh.\r\nMai: It's kind of embarrassing. ...Okay, I'm ready to go.\r\nKanami: Then, here we go!\r\nKanami: Ohh!? We're moving really fast!! Ah, I saw Yui-chan over that way!\r\nMai: Eh, where at? Oh, Tsugumi-san is with her too!\r\nMai: This feels like you could use it to train your kinetic vision, huh, Kanami-chan!\r\nKanami: Hey, you're starting to sound like me now!?\r\n\r\nKanami: Ahh... That was so fun!\r\nKanami: Let's go again, and bring Yui-chan and Tsugumi-san along! This time, you can sit in front, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: Alright!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/WUlpqEzhjx0\r\n[Yui: Start]: The Pool is Heaven\r\n\r\nYui: Tsugumi-san, want to come to the pool with me next Sunday?\r\nTsugumi: Just the two of us, Yamashiro-san?\r\nYui: You're fine with it just being you and me!? You're so adventurous, Tsugumi-san-!!\r\nTsugumi: I am not. Besides, wouldn't it be boring going to the pool with someone like myself?\r\nYui: Seriously-! I don't get it; how could a date at the pool all alone with a cute girl ever be boring?\r\nTsugumi: It's impossible to predict what will set you off, Yamashiro-san.\r\nTsugumi: ...Will anyone else be coming?\r\nYui: Uhh, as far as I've heard, there's Kanami-chan, Mai-chan, Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan...\r\nTsugumi: ...That's enough. I get the gist of it now.\r\nYui: So anyway, come to the pool with us! Or, is there some research you have to do?\r\nTsugumi: No, on Sunday, I'll be available.\r\nYui: Hooray-! Be sure to get an extra cute swimsuit ready for it, okay-!\r\n\r\nYui: What kind of swimsuit did you buy, Tsugumi-san?\r\nTsugumi: Just an ordinary one.\r\nYui: Did you really get a swimsuit just for this!? I'm so glad to hear it!\r\nTsugumi: There's nothing wrong with having a swimsuit handy.\r\nTsugumi: How much swimming do you plan on doing, Yamashiro-san?\r\nYui: You think we're going swimming!?\r\nYui: No wait, since we're going to the pool together, we should have fun with each other!\r\nTsugumi: But, isn't the purpose of a pool facility to let you swim?\r\nYui: That's what school pools are for. But we're here to enjoy the pool today!\r\nTsugumi: Enjoy it? ...I see, that is another way of looking at it.\r\nYui: That's right! And to that end, I, Yamashiro Yui! Have studied the pool to perfection!\r\nYui: What I recommend trying at this pool we're going to is the floating island attraction, Tsugumi-san!\r\nTsugumi: The \"floating island attraction\"?\r\nYui: That's right! It's an attraction featuring floating platforms in the pool that you try to cross over while dodging obstacles!\r\nYui: They have water slides and stuff too, but that sounded like the most fun to me!\r\nYui: So you should look forward to it, okay?\r\nTsugumi: It does sound like fun, doesn't it-.\r\nYui: Of course it does! I was getting so excited about it last night that I could barely sleep.\r\nYui: From the sound of things, Kanami-chan and Mai-chan got there ahead of us, so we should race on over there too!\r\nYui: I just can't calm down anymore~. The pool is seriously like visiting heaven!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Yui: End]: This is What I Wanted to Do!\r\n\r\nYui: We've arrived at the floating island attraction! I will now explain the rules!\r\nKanami: The rules?\r\nYui: The difficulty of this attraction is designed for normal people, but we're toji!\r\nYui: That's why; don't you think we ought to make it more challenging?\r\nMai: You have a point. If it's too easy, it won't be very fun.\r\nYui: I knew you'd understand, Mai-chan!\r\nTsugumi: How exactly do you plan on making it more challenging though?\r\nTsugumi: Are we going to cross it while doing a handstand?\r\nYui: A handstand!?\r\nYui: Going upside down in swimsuits on the floating islands... Everybody's bodies wobbling around... Tsugumi-san, are you a genius...?\r\nMai: Hang on, wouldn't doing a handstand on it be dangerous? We have to set a good moral standard.\r\nYui: Ugh... If that's what your conscience as a toji says, then we'll just have to go along...\r\nYui: So, like I originally planned, we'll cross the floating islands in pairs while holding each other's hands!\r\nKanami: We have to hold hands... That sounds like it would really restrict our movements.\r\nMai: Not to mention, if one person lost their balance, it would be easy for both to fall in.\r\nTsugumi: That should make for a nice adjustment to the difficulty, Yamashiro-san.\r\nYui: Sure it does; I racked my brain coming up with it. Tsugumi-san, you and I should be the first pair to go!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: ...This takes an even greater sense of balance than I realized... Whoops.\r\nYui: Watch out, Tsugumi-san! Come and lean your body into me!\r\nTsugumi: Thanks for supporting me, Yamashiro-san.\r\nYui: I should be the one thanking you hereee.\r\nYui: (The perfectly legitimate reason I invented to press up against girls on the floating islands is a huge success!)\r\nYui: (Ahh, this is bad. I'm enjoying this so much it hurts! I wish time could stop here forever!)\r\nYui: Uhehe, uheheheheh!\r\nTsugumi: What's the matter, Yamashiro-san?\r\nYui: Nothing at all, just that the wonderfulness of the pool is getting to mee.\r\nTsugumi: True, I'm having a better time than I thought I would.\r\nTsugumi: ...Yamashiro-san, thank you for asking me to come with you.\r\nYui: Tsugumi-san smiled...\r\nYui: (Wait? The mood here... If I confessed to her right now, doesn't it seem like she'd accept?)\r\nYui: Tsugumi-san, I-- PHWAGH!?\r\nTsugumi: The water hoses have started up.\r\nYui: Did you really have to give me a cold shower nowwwwww!?\r\nTsugumi: Yamashiro-san!? You'll slip on the wet platform, moving like that...\r\nYui/Tsugumi: KYAAAAAAA!?\r\n\r\nTsugumi: We failed, didn't we...\r\nYui: But, I still had a lot of fun. Let's go again, Tsugumi-san!"}, {"paste_key": "heYYtrmh", "title": "Full Summer Beach Lounge Rescue Team!", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/heYYtrmh", "timestamp": "", "hits": "86", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/sIQNYYemcEg\r\n\r\n1: Bringing the Summer Bustle to the Beach!\r\n\r\nMihono: IT'S THE SEA-!!!\r\nMihono: But... Why aren't there any other people here?\r\nMirja: That's precisely why this is the site of our summer mission.\r\nSayaka: What do you mean?\r\nChie: A little while ago, aradama were frequently appearing across this area. That's why, even now in beachgoing season, visitors don't seem to be coming here.\r\nKaoru: Ah-, it's that stuff they call secondary damage.\r\nTsugumi: I see, so our mission now is to restore the reputation and popularity of this beach.\r\nMirja: That's correct. If we can popularize this beach lounge and attract people back to this beach, our mission will be complete.\r\nKofuki: So basically... They've got us doing random chores again!\r\nSayaka: This is one of our important duties as toji.\r\nTsugumi: That's right, Shichinosato-san. You can't go complaining just because it's not the job you want-.\r\nKofuki: Just cause you're cool with doing whatever you're told... I wanna play with some aradama-chan! Wouldn't a job like that be more fun hands down!?\r\nMihono: But hey, doesn't all of us working together at the beach lounge sound fun too? Come on, Fukki!\r\nMihono: And, if an aradama does show up, it'll be easy for us to get everyone to safety if we let you handle it!\r\nKofuki: Aghh, fine... I got it, okay! We just have to get this place popular again and get it over with... Whatever.\r\nSayaka: ...Then, are we going to think up how to get people to come here?\r\nChie: Sure, don't be shy and tell us any ideas you come up with. I want you to keep the ideas coming.\r\n\r\nMirja: Toji made yakisoba seems to be a sure seller... Actually, it could be considered an attraction as well, so we have to keep it.\r\nChie: You can leave the cooking to your onee-san here.\r\nKaoru: In that case, I'll be in charge of making absolutely sure the lounge and food are all up to standard-.\r\nTsugumi: If you're looking to put more unusual foods on the menu, I could offer some of the portable emergency rations I've developed.\r\nKofuki: They'd better not be that garbage that makes you pass out... Those'll backfire on you if you aren't careful.\r\nTsugumi: Don't I look perfectly healthy to you? What better guarantee of its safety do you need? If you still have misgivings, let's have Mashiko-san sample some!\r\nKaoru: Uegh... They are safe to eat, aren't they? ...Aren't they?\r\nMihono: Looks like the food's all taken care of. The rentals for floaty rings and the showers look good too!\r\nMihono: But, it feels like something's missing... We need something with more impact! Something that'll bring in lots of people!\r\nMirja: You do have a point; as it is now it's a standard beach lounge-- I can't say we've differentiated it from being a usual swimming spot.\r\nMihono: I've got it! What if we do this?\r\n\r\nSayaka: --YAA!\r\nTsugumi: The watermelon was split clean apart! And then into six even slices.\r\nTsugumi: Now then, everyone, please give her a big round of applause-.\r\nMihono: Yeah, yeah! Great going, Itomi-san! Now it's getting exciting!\r\nMihono: And we should be able to sell the watermelon used in the performance for cheap, so it all works out.\r\nSayaka: It's because of the idea you came up with, Mihono. ...It really is a great idea.\r\nMihono: Hey~, you don't have to give me all the praise~. I'll go next, splitting the watermelon all cool-!\r\n\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nChie: Mihono-chan's watermelon splitting performance is starting to generate some attention.\r\nKaoru: Seems like it. Still though, where'd they hear about us splitting watermelons from?\r\nChie: It is strange, isn't it?\r\nChie: ...Ah, Kofuki-chan, come give us a hand. You've been playing around on your phone all this time.\r\nKofuki: I'm busy working on my own thing here.\r\nChie: ...What was that?\r\nKofuki: When you smile like that, it's friggin' scary, Chichie...! I've been busy sending stuff to Kiyoka. Pictures and videos of Mihocchi and them.\r\nMirja: To Musumi Kiyoka?\r\nKofuki: She's been spreading it over social media. More customers are showing up, right?\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan, thank you. But, let's have you work seriously in the lounge too, okay?\r\nKofuki: S-Sure... Then, I'm gonna go help out Mihocchi...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Making Summer Memories Splitting Watermelons!\r\n\r\nMirja: Phew... Now that lunch has passed, there are fewer customers stopping at the beach lounge, but more are coming back to the beach than I had anticipated.\r\nKaoru: We get to take it easy, with Sayaka and them working so hard.\r\nKaoru: ...Or I wish, but in the end, it's still at the level where I've gotta work in the beach lounge too...\r\nMirja: The effect of the aradama had also caused financial losses for farmers in the area, so in that sense too, having to purchase their watermelons for the performance was an excellent proposal.\r\nChie: Though, when they find out we're toji, they all want to see us split the watermelons, so it's a bit hard keeping up.\r\nKaoru: Ellen said she saw a video of Sayaka chopping watermelons too. Sounds like it's gotten a ton of views.\r\nMirja: When we first took up this mission, we were reliant on Musumi Kiyoka to spread the footage, but it seems as though that's no longer the case.\r\nTsugumi: Excuse mee-, we're running out of watermelons. Everyone, please come help carry more inn-.\r\nChie: Ehh... Shouldn't we have several crates of watermelons left over?\r\nTsugumi: Itomi-san and Asakura-san are really going at it.\r\nTsugumi: I even had Shichinosato-san substitute for them several times while they took a break.\r\nMirja: Is that how popular it's become... Then, let's prepare more watermelons right away.\r\n\r\nMihono: This time... I'll do it blindfolded...!\r\nMihono: Okaaay! Is everybody watching-? --HAA!\r\nMihono: As you can see, I split the watermelon nice and clean...\r\nMihono: ...Or not!!\r\nMihono: But! It's still really tasty, so you should all give some a try-!\r\nKid Who Came to Swim: Onee-chan, show me more of you whacking the watermelons open-! Do it like where you break it into a bunch of slices in an instant!\r\nMihono: Fufu! Coming right up!\r\nMihono: Ah, how about this, Itomi-san and I will cut two at the same time! That'd look really cool, I bet!\r\nSayaka: Mm, I want to try doing it together too.\r\nKofuki: Oi, wait up! Those two are all the watermelons we've got left.\r\nMihono: It's fine, it's fine! Tsugumi-san said she'll be bringing more any minute now. Let's get started!\r\n\r\nMihono: Thank you, thank you! We'll be doing this again tomorrow, so come and see-!\r\nSayaka: I'll be waiting with the watermelons too. Come on, Kofuki, you say something too.\r\nKofuki: ...Why do I have to.\r\n\r\nChie: I'm glad we brought in such a crowd, but there really is too much watermelon to get rid of. Even when some people did buy them...\r\nMirja: After receiving all of them, we need to ensure that none go to waste.\r\nMirja: However, at the current pace of demand, with the amount of leftover watermelon, each of us would have to eat 5 melons...\r\nMirja: Sigh... To be honest, I'd rather not think about it.\r\nKaoru: When it comes down to it, Mihono and Sayaka need us to put in some effort too. It's not like they taste bad, so we'll just have to power through.\r\nTsugumi: Hmm, maybe I'll experiment with a special made watermelon based juice...\r\nChie: Everyone-, gather around-. We have one last job to do today-.\r\n\r\nMihono: Phew... I like watermelons and all, but... I think I don't need any more for a long while...?\r\nSayaka: My belly's full...\r\nMirja: However, we can now conclude things without any watermelon needing to be disposed of. Our mission here is complete. Good work, all of you.\r\nChie: ...Everyone, listen to this. The union that manages this beach lounge wants to thank us for bringing visitors back here...\r\nChie: They said they wanted to host a dinner party for us... Right after this...\r\nKofuki: Can't we put that off to tomorrow or something, Chichie...?\r\nChie: They're already getting it ready, from the sound of it...\r\nMihono: They say that sweets go in a different stomach, so all the watermelon we ate must be there instead of our normal stomachs!\r\nKaoru: That's the first time I've heard somebody say that after eating all the sweets first... But Mihono's got the right idea.\r\nMirja: We mustn't turn down their kind offer.\r\nMirja: ...So then, let's head on to our final battlefield. However, all of you... By no means should you force yourself to do the impossible!\r\nSayaka: I won't force myself... I'll do my best to eat.\r\nTsugumi: I'll have some stomach medicine ready in secret later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/7xz_k03cXQA\r\n[Sayaka: Start]: Do Your Best, Enjoy Yourself!\r\n\r\nSayaka: ...Sorry I made you wait.\r\nKaoru: Oh-, you made it. Now everybody's here.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nEllen: It's too bad we couldn't all get time off together, but let's enjoy ourselves as best we can today!\r\nEllen: Come on, let's go to the pool-!\r\n\r\nSayaka: ...Kaoru, when we get to the pool, what will you do?\r\nKaoru: Good question... When you go to a pool, you've gotta try the lazy river pool, right?\r\nSayaka: Lazy river pool?\r\nKaoru: You get to float down a river on a pool tube, and then you fall asleep. Just picturing it, it's the best...\r\nSayaka: ...Is that, fun?\r\nKaoru: 'Course it's fun.\r\nKaoru: Just floating around in the pool is fun on its own.\r\nSayaka: Just floating around in the pool...\r\nEllen: Don't listen to her! Kaoru's the only one who'd find that fun, okay?\r\nEllen: Saaya, if you want to have fun, let's do something more aggressive... Ah!\r\nSayaka: What is it?\r\nEllen: ...Saaya! There's something important I have to check with you.\r\nSayaka: What?\r\nEllen: Did you... bring a swimsuit? Maybe you brought the normal school issued one...\r\nSayaka: I didn't. Mai chose one for me.\r\nSayaka: This one.\r\nEllen: You can always count on Maimai! It's the perfect color for you too, Saaya!\r\nSayaka: Thank you...\r\nEllen: All my worries are cleared away then! So... What should we play with first?\r\nSayaka: ...There's so many things to try; I don't know what to do.\r\nEllen: We can do anything you want, Saaya. Let's start with one side and enjoy ourselves!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sayaka: End]: Will You, Ride With Me?\r\n\r\nAttendant: Okay, the next person can go-.\r\nEllen: Oh, it's your turn, Saaya!\r\nSayaka: I just have to slide?\r\nEllen: Yes! It's just a big slide down!\r\nSayaka: A big slide...\r\nAttendant: Are you two friends-? In that case, the two of you can go down together-.\r\nSayaka: Together... Ellen, will you slide with me?\r\nEllen: -!!\r\nSayaka: Ellen, are you listening?\r\nEllen: O-Oh... ...Saaya, you're playing dirty.\r\nSayaka: Dirty?\r\nEllen: You're being too cute! You're not giving me any choice but to give you a hug!\r\nSayaka: Ellen, now you're hugging me too tight and it hurts.\r\nEllen: Oh, sorry about that!\r\nEllen: Anyway, Saaya, say what you just said again one more time!\r\nSayaka: What I just said... Will you ride down with me?\r\nEllen: Good!\r\nAttendant: Okay-, you're going together then-.\r\nEllen: Then... Here we go, Saaya!\r\nSayaka: Mm...!\r\nEllen: Oh! We're moving quicker than I thought we would!\r\nSayaka: But, I'm having fun.\r\nEllen: Yes! It's a whole lot of fun!\r\nEllen: Aww, we made it to the finish line already.\r\nSayaka: Let's go one more time.\r\nEllen: Of course! Let's invite Kaoru along this time too!\r\nSayaka: Okay. Kaoru is... Ah, she fell asleep in the river pool.\r\nEllen: She really did.\r\nEllen: Just like she said she would, she's sleeping so peacefully. Let's go wake her up, Saaya!\r\nSayaka: Okay!\r\nEllen: Kaoru-! It's time to wake up now-! We're all going down the water slide-!\r\nKaoru: Whoa-!? What's going on!?\r\nSayaka: I'm glad. I think I'll have a lot to tell Mai about the pool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/UrOq6F25WZg\r\n[Chie: Start]: Shirie\r\n\r\nKofuki: You've got a fat ass too, huh, Chichie.\r\nChie: ......\r\nChie: I'm sorry, Kofuki-chan. I didn't quite hear you just now.\r\nChie: Do you think you could say that again?\r\nKofuki: I said your ass is fat too, Chichie.\r\nKofuki: Is that what they call childbearing hips? What'd you eat to get it that fat, Shirie? \t[Much like chichi means tits, shiri means ass]\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan!!\r\nKofuki: What're you getting mad for!? I was just making a simple observation!!\r\nChie: This is one of those things you should keep to yourself!\r\nChie: I can't believe you. Can we please have a good time here without you saying things like that?\r\nKofuki: I'm having plenty of a good time though.\r\nKofuki: Anyway, you should try taking it easy, Chichie. Since we came to the pool and all.\r\nKofuki: You've been having a hard time, right?\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan... Thank you.\r\nChie: I didn't think you would be so concerned about me...\r\nKofuki: Yeah, yeah, dragging that fat ass around must be a lot of work.\r\nChie: ...Oh. Fufu, so that's what you meant, hmm?\r\nChie: And here your onee-san was proud of you for a moment.\r\nKofuki: Oh shit, she's seriously pissed! I'm outta here!!\r\nChie: Ah, hold it right there!\r\nChie: Honestly, she's so quick to run away...\r\nChie: ...Does it really look that fat?\r\nChie: Good grief, all this anger's left me feeling worn out. I'll rest a little.\r\n\r\nKofuki: That was close... If she'd have caught me, I'd get a whole lecture.\r\nKofuki: I'm not about to stand around while she chews me out in this place.\r\nKofuki: And I mean, her ass is fat.\r\nKofuki: Ah... I got it...!\r\nKofuki: Heheh!\r\n\r\nChie: There we go.\r\nChie: ...Hmm? I felt something strange at my waist...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Chie: End]: Don't Make Others Angry\r\n\r\nKofuki: Crap, she noticed!\r\nChie: ......Kofuki-chan?\r\nChie: What are you doing there?\r\nKofuki: I was just, uh, interested in how these type of swimsuits work.\r\nChie: ...Is there anything else you'd like to say?\r\nKofuki: Your ass is just as fat as I thought!\r\nChie: That's more like you. They'll make fitting last words.\r\nKofuki: O-Oi, what's that supposed to mean, Chichie? My last...\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan? I hope you're prepared for this.\r\nKofuki: Wha-, hang on! It's just a cute little prank, right!?\r\nKofuki: Besides, it's not like you aren't wearing anything under the pareo, so you don't have to freak out even if it comes off!\r\nChie: ...Sohayanotsuruki.\r\nKofuki: Hey, you, wait, okatana are off limits, okay!? Where'd you even pull that from!?\r\nChie: A toji must always keep their okatana in arms reach, isn't that right?\r\nKofuki: So where were you keeping it!?\r\nKofuki: Oi... C-Cut it out!\r\nKofuki: GYAA----!!\r\n\r\nChie: Really now, isn't it time you learned there are some lines even friends don't cross? It's important to know right from wrong, Kofuki-chan.\r\nKofuki: ...I'm sorry.\r\nChie: And also, my butt isn't big. It's normal sized.\r\nKofuki: Nah, it's pretty...\r\nChie: Nn?\r\nKofuki: ...I'm sorry.\r\nChie: Have you learned your lesson?\r\nKofuki: Sigh... I shouldn't have done that, okay...\r\nKofuki: Ughh...\r\nKofuki: (I'll just stick to messing with her tits from now on...)"}, {"paste_key": "AqC9v8e4", "title": "On a Nice Cool Evening!

There's already so many stands set up! I can't wait for the festival to start~.\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san. By running around like that, you're obstructing the people constructing stands and transporting goods.\r\nMaki: Yomi's right, Yume. We came here with Yukari-sama to lead and the supervise the toji joining in the festival, as part of giving back to the community.\r\nYume: Ehhh, but it's boring if that's all we get to do-.\r\nYume: Hey, Yukari-sama~? After the festival gets started, we can go around and check out whatever we want, right-?\r\nSuzuka: We aren't here to play, Yume. Our mission here is simply to patrol the area.\r\nYume: Ehh~...\r\nYukari: So long as you remember not to neglect your patrol, I don't mind if you enjoy the festivities.\r\nYume: Okay! Just leave the patrolling to me~. Which stand should I go eat at first~?\r\nYume: Onee-sans, what do you want to go see?\r\nYomi: There's nothing I want to see in particular.\r\nMaki: Can't we just go around seeing whatever you're interested in, Yume?\r\nYume: But we're all here at a festival? You have to have a good time too! So think about it harder, okay?\r\nYume: Ah, that one over there looks good-! I'll be right back!\r\nSuzuka: She's been caught up in the festival spirit before we even started.\r\nYomi: She said she had gone together with her parents when she was younger.\r\nMaki: ...I see. In that case... I guess there's no helping it then.\r\nMaki: Hm? Something's causing a commotion over that way.\r\nFestival Prepping Toji: I-I have a report to make...!\r\nYukari: What is it?\r\nFestival Prepping Toji: Aradama seem to have stolen the paper lanterns we used as decorations! We ourselves spotted several aradama fleeing with lanterns caught on them...!\r\nYukari: Aradama are taking the lanterns? What's the meaning of this?\r\nFestival Prepping Toji: I'm not sure, but... The aradama with the lanterns are just marching around the festival area, so it doesn't seem like there's been any serious damage caused yet.\r\nYukari: Hm... It's a bizarre case, but we can hardly hold the festival if there are aradama here.\r\nMaki: Yukari-sama, with the help of the toji on patrol, we will clear out these aradama and recover the stolen lanterns.\r\nYukari: Good then; include investigating these aradama as part of your mission, and see it done.\r\nMaki: Yes ma'am!\r\nYume: We all came to the festival, so I don't want any aradama going and ruining it!\r\nYume: Though, won't it be really annoying getting the lanterns back?\r\nYomi: Without the lanterns, the festival's atmosphere will be spoiled. The pleasant mood of the festival is its greatest charm.\r\nYume: Well, if Yomi-onee-san says so, then I'll try not to break the lanterns.\r\nYume: Come on, let's go take care of this fast.\r\nMaki: ...Wait, don't go on your own!\r\nSuzuka: I'll guide the civilians away from here and reunite with you later. Yomi-san, please support the two of them.\r\nYomi: Understood. Then, Yukari-sama... I will be going now.\r\nYukari: Right, best of luck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Sharing the Festival with Everyone!\r\n\r\nYukari: Excellent work, not only with suppressing the aradama, but also with directing the other toji. With your efforts, the situation was put under control before much harm could be done.\r\nYomi: The paper lanterns were safely recovered as well. It may have been delayed half an hour, but the festival should be ready to open shortly.\r\nYume: The festival~, the festival~.\r\nYomi: It seems it's started.\r\nYume: Then, let's go-!\r\nYukari: Wait, Yume.\r\nYume: Ehh... But you said I could look around the festival before~.\r\nYukari: I have here yukata for the four of you. Once you've changed, you may enjoy the festival to the fullest.\r\nYume: Wow! Now it really feels like a festival!! Thanks, Yukari-sama!\r\nYukari: That's right. You should thank Yuzuki... Ayanokouji's president. She's the one who prepared these.\r\nYume: Okay! Anyway, I'm gonna go change!\r\nSuzuka: We should follow along with her.\r\nMaki: We can't exactly ignore this offer, after all.\r\n\r\nYume: This takoyaki is yummy! Yomi-onee-san, I'll give you a bite too, eat up.\r\nYomi: Thank you... Ohm, mm, it's a little hot... Though it is tasty.\r\nYume: I told you~. I think it's even better than the takoyaki I usually have?\r\nSuzuka: Fufu... On top of shaved ice and chocolate bananas, they're offering buttered potatoes as well.\r\nMaki: Suzuka. This came up when you were looking at the food stalls around New Year's, but is buttered potato one of your favorites?\r\nSuzuka: That's right. I don't often get to sample them, so the moment I do see them, I always want to have a taste.\r\nYume: Ah, you can scoop for goldfish there! Can I try that?\r\nYukari: Fine, go on.\r\nYume: You better watch, okay~? I'm gonna catch a whole bunch of them!\r\n\r\nYume: Geez, why can't I catch a single goldfish~!?\r\nYomi: If you shout so loudly, you'll alert the goldfish.\r\nYume: But they keep swimming away as soon as I try! Hey hey, onee-sans, show me how to do it-.\r\nSuzuka: Do your best to show her how it's done, Maki-san, Yomi-san. I will cheer you on.\r\nMaki: Hey... That's no fair, Suzuka.\r\nYomi: Understood. I will give it a try.\r\nMaki: Kh... So Yomi's taking this seriously. Mister, give me a scoop too. If I'm going to do this, I don't want to lose.\r\nYomi: ...Then, prepare yourself.\r\n\r\nYume: Yomi-onee-san... How'd you get so good at scooping goldfish!? The old guy running the stall looked like he was gonna cry halfway through.\r\nYukari: Indeed... That's quite the haul. I was surprised as well.\r\nYomi: I may have overdone it. So I made sure to return some of them.\r\nMaki: Why... couldn't I catch a single one...?\r\nSuzuka: Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. You excel at so many other things, Maki-san.\r\nYukari: Suzuka...\r\nYomi: You seemed to want these goldfish, Tsubakuro-san, but are you going to look after them?\r\nYume: Can I!?\r\nYomi: Though, festival goldfish live very short lives. Will you keep them regardless?\r\nYume: Hmmm. Even if that's true, since you caught them for me, I'll let them live for a really long time!\r\nYukari: It seems the fireworks have begun.\r\nYume: Woww-, they're so pretty-!\r\nSuzuka: Yes, they truly are...\r\nMaki: TAMAYA-!\r\nYume: What's that?\r\nMaki: It's something you're supposed to shout when fireworks are going off, though I'm not really sure why.\r\nYume: Huh, I didn't know!\r\nYume: TA-MAYA-! This is kinda fun!\r\nYume: I hope we get to see the fireworks together again next year-.\r\nYume: Ah! We can all set off fireworks together next time!\r\nMaki: Fireworks, huh. It's been a while since I did them myself.\r\nSuzuka: It wouldn't have quite the same atmosphere as this, but it sounds highly entertaining.\r\nYukari: So long as you take proper caution with the fire, I'll allow it.\r\nYume: You'll allow it... But you'll be doing it with us, Yukari-sama?\r\nYukari: I will?\r\nYume: We're making a promise!\r\nYume: Pinky swear, and whoever lies, they get a needle in their eye~!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/jdKVXQRmnJ0\r\n[Yukata Yomi: Start]: We Mustn't Get Lost\r\n\r\nYume: That yukata really matches you, Yomi-onee-san. It looks good-.\r\nYomi: Thank you very much. I'm thankful for President Souraku's good judgment.\r\nYomi: You look very good in yours as well, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Don't I-? When I saw it, I thought, President Souraku knows her stuff! My yukata's so cute!\r\nMaki: Yume.\r\nYume: Eh... Wah!?\r\nMaki: The crowd's thick. If you don't look where you're going, you'll bump into someone.\r\nYume: Actually, what's with this huge line!?\r\nSuzuka: Business is booming. What could it be for?\r\nStall Managing Toji: Ah, the elite guard, with Yukari-sama...! This line is for our yakisoba.\r\nYukari: ...!\r\nStall Managing Toji: Yakisoba seemed popular at festivals in the past, so we tried copying that, but this was more than I imagined...\r\nYukari: I see.\r\nYukari: ......\r\nYomi: Yukari-sama... If you'd like some, I could stand in line for you?\r\nStall Managing Toji: Yukari-sama herself... Wants to try our yakisoba!?\r\nStall Managing Toji: I-I'll bring you some straight away...!\r\nYukari: ...No, stop. The two of you needn't concern yourselves with me.\r\nYukari: With all these people in line, I shouldn't be the only one to receive special treatment.\r\nYukari: Yomi, you have your duty to patrol and observe the area. As for the yakisoba... That's right. If any is left over, I will have some then.\r\nYomi: As you wish.\r\nYukari: Don't let it bother you. Now then, we'll look around elsewhere. We have to ensure no one is hurt or in trouble.\r\nStall Managing Toji: ...Y-Yes ma'am!\r\nYume: Is Yukari-sama okay with that-? With how long that line is, won't they run out quick for sure?\r\nYomi: If Yukari-sama insists, we shouldn't object any further.\r\nYume: Ehh, but she looked like she wanted to have some-.\r\nMaki: We're going, you two. We can't allow Yukari-sama to go on ahead by herself.\r\nYomi: We can't afford to get lost either. Will you take my hand, Tsubakuro-san?\r\nYume: Guess I don't have a choice, huh~. We'd be in a lot of trouble if you got lost, Yomi-onee-san.\r\nYomi: Yes, I'll feel better this way. Let's go join them.\r\nYume: Okay!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Yukata Yomi: End]: Someday, in Memory\r\n\r\nYume: Ah, there's this thing with all these little balls floating in the water! Hey hey, what is this?\r\nSuzuka: I'm not quite sure what all these balls are for...\r\nYomi: They're for super ball scooping.\r\nYume/Suzuka: ...Super ball?\r\nYume: Why are they super?\r\nYomi: Their repulsive force is super. If you throw them against the wall or floor, they bounce off with great force. And also, the rugby ball shaped ones bounce unpredictably.\r\nYume: They sound fun! I want some! I can try scooping them, can't I?\r\nMaki: Fine by me; go ahead.\r\nYume: I'll get a whole lot, so I'll give you some too, Suzuka-onee-san!\r\nSuzuka: Good. I'll look forward to it.\r\nYomi: Allow me to offer some advice before you attempt it. It's a common misconception, but it's actually harder for the scoop to be broken if you let it fully soak in the water.\r\nYume: Wait, really!?\r\nYomi: If only a part of it is wet, it will break more easily. Also, I suggest not aiming for larger ones and many at once.\r\nYume: Thanks for the tips, Yomi-onee-san.\r\n\r\nYomi: You did it, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Wasn't it way easier than the goldfish though, cause they aren't moving around on their own-?\r\nYume: Wait, where's Suzuka-onee-san and Maki-onee-san?\r\nYomi: Over there, eating shaved ice.\r\n\r\nMaki: You can't go to a summer festival without trying this.\r\nSuzuka: Strawberry, melon, lemon, blue hawaii... They had so many choices that I couldn't make my mind up.\r\nMaki: You went with blue hawaii, didn't you?\r\nSuzuka: I couldn't imagine how it would taste. I only chose it on your recommendation. It's sweet and rather good.\r\nMaki: The only downside is it turns your tongue blue.\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, and what's wrong with that? I find that sort of thing funny.\r\nMaki: I had a feeling you'd say something like that.\r\nSuzuka: Hey...!\r\n\r\nYume: Ah! Lucky-. We should get some shaved ice too!\r\nYomi: I agree. What flavor would you like, Tsubakuro-san?\r\nYume: Strawberry!\r\nYomi: Understood. I'll go buy it, so please wait here for a moment.\r\nYume: I'll just go with you!\r\nYomi: That reminds me, earlier, I saw an Ichigo Daifuku Neko mask in one of the stalls.\r\nYume: Wait, you did!?\r\nYomi: Should we go buy that first?\r\nYume: ...Isn't wearing masks sort of for kids-? I do like Ichigo Daifuku Neko though.\r\nYomi: Do you think so? I think it would be cute if you wore it, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: W-Well... If you say so, Yomi-onee-san, then maybe we can go look around for it a little, after we get shaved ice.\r\nYomi: I think that's a good idea.\r\nYume: Festivals sure are fun, huh.\r\nYomi: Yes, very much so."}, {"paste_key": "UA8SLAPq", "title": "Inago Akira Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/UA8SLAPq", "timestamp": "", "hits": "121", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/711imvBKFEk\r\nhttps://youtu.be/aiA2svZtMos\r\n\r\n1: Not Like I Dislike It!\r\n\r\nAkira: ......\r\nNene: Ne?\r\nToji A: Hey...

Did I just run up on something, or what... Geh!? I popped another tire!?\r\nAkira: How many times is that this month!? I don't got the money to fix another hole-! But, it's not like I can leave it here either... Guess I've gotta push...\r\n\r\nAkira: Pant, pant... M-Made it, finally...\r\nAoto Hina: Oh, did you pop a tire?\r\nAkira: Huhh? Who're you supposed to be?\r\nHina: I'm Aoto Hina; a second year in high school at Renpu Girls' Academy. I'm from the swordsmithing department.\r\nAkira: Ahh...\r\nAkira: Sorry 'bout that, didn't know you were my senpai. I'm a first year in high school, from the toji department. Inago Akira.\r\nHina: Ooh, from the toji department! In that case, have you heard of Aoto-kan, in Harajuku?\r\nAkira: I've heard of it...\r\nHina: Well, that's my family's business. If your okatana's giving you trouble, be sure to come on by Aoto-kan, and we'll... Wait, that's not it.\r\nHina: Uhh, you popped your tire, right?\r\nAkira: Ah, yep.\r\nHina: I thought so. Um, if it's okay with you, want me to fix it?\r\nHina: There's someone at Renpu who rides a bike too, so I've fixed a popped tire before.\r\nAkira: You don't got to be so polite. Anyway, I'd appreciate it, Hina-san.\r\nHina: We're in business!\r\nAkira: (I'm saved. Still, there's somebody who rides a bike at Renpu?

If you still wanna give me a hard time then...\r\nKazumi: No, that's not what I meant.\r\nKazumi: I'm sorry, this is the first time I've met another person who rides a bike, so I couldn't help myself.\r\nAkira: A biker from Renpu...\r\nAkira: Ah, don't tell me, you're the one Hina-san was talking about...\r\nKazumi: I see I wasn't mistaken.\r\nKazumi: I thought you might have been the toji from Minoseki whose punctured tire Hina-san helped repair.\r\n\r\nAkira: Thanks for today, Kazumi-san.\r\nKazumi: No, I'm the one who should be thanking you. For a toji of your ability to be so unknown was an honest surprise.\r\nAkira: Well, y'know. Anyway, how long've you been biking for, Kazumi-san?\r\nKazumi: As soon as I was able to get my license, I did. That would have been about two years ago.\r\nAkira: Then, you must be way more experienced than me!\r\nKazumi: Why did you decide to start riding a bike, Akira-san?\r\nAkira: At first, I sort of admired them. Then, after I tried riding one, it was like I was floating on air... I got totally hooked after.\r\nKazumi: Yes, I understand that feeling. And it's as if the world opens up for you, isn't it?\r\nKazumi: In the beginning, I only got my license thinking it would be useful for travel. But I found I greatly enjoyed it after I started riding..\r\nAkira: I know, right! It's the best!\r\nKazumi: So then, Akira-san. If it would be alright with you, would you like to ride together sometime?\r\nAkira: Me and you? That'd be great!\r\nAkira: There's nobody else I get to talk about bikes this much with, so this was fun as hell.\r\nKazumi: The same goes for myself. In that case, on our next holiday, let's go on a high speed tour.\r\nAkira: Sure thing!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Old Friends\r\n\r\nAkira: Yo, let's get something to eat, Yomi.\r\nYomi: ...Akira.\r\nYomi: I'm busy with the preparations for the tournament, so I don't have the time to spare.\r\nMaki: Do you know her?\r\nYomi: She's someone from my hometown.\r\nAkira: Just tell her we're childhood friends. What're you, embarrassed? \r\nYomi: ...She's an old friend.\r\nMaki: I see.\r\nMaki: In that case, why don't you go with her? I'll do what I can to make progress here.\r\nAkira: See? Listen to that.\r\nYomi: ...I'm sorry, Shidou-san. I'll be going out for a bit.\r\n\r\nAkira: Time to dig in-.\r\nYomi: ...\r\nAkira: You not gonna eat anything, Yomi?\r\nYomi: You're too pushy, Akira.\r\nAkira: Shidou Maki said it was fine, so what's the problem?\r\nAkira: Come on, eat up. The set today's pretty good.\r\nYomi: ...Today's rice was well cooked. It's delicious.\r\nAkira: You love rice the same as ever, huh.\r\nYomi: Rice is delicious.\r\nYomi: ...You've changed, Akira. In the past, you wouldn't have worn those delinquent looking clothes.\r\nYomi: What would auntie say if she saw?\r\nAkira: Hey, she said I could do whatever I pleased?\r\nAkira: Anyway, you're the one who changed. You turned into a total goody two shoes.\r\nYomi: I haven't changed at all.\r\nAkira: You should go home sometime. You're making auntie lonely, y'know?\r\nYomi: ...Do you go back home, Akira?\r\nAkira: Sure, all the time. It's a quick ride on a bike.\r\nYomi: ...\r\nAkira: Oh, and y'know Mucchan? Well, she...\r\nYomi: Why didn't you participate in the tournament qualifiers? Shouldn't you have been able to become a representative?\r\nAkira: Ahh, I caught a cold.\r\nYomi: That side of you hasn't changed. You always fell apart before a big occasion.\r\nAkira: I couldn't sleep that night, no matter what.

For some reason, the girl I'm paired up with looks super scaryyyyyy!?)\r\nFutaba: Oi, you!\r\nFutaba: Y-Yes, what is it!?\r\nAkira: There's aradama!\r\nFutaba: Huh!? The spectrum meter hasn't picked anything up yet...\r\nFutaba: H-How'd you know they were here!?\r\nAkira: Just my intuition!\r\nAkira: One, two, three... Bring it on! Be sure you keep up!\r\nFutaba: R-Right!\r\n\r\nAkira: ORAORAORAORA!\r\nFutaba: Ehh!?\r\nFutaba: (Sh-She's so strong!? Nobody told me there was a senpai this strong here!?)\r\nAkira: Well, that's all there is to it.\r\nFutaba: You ended up beating them all on your own...\r\nAkira: Hey.\r\nFutaba: Y-Yes!?\r\nAkira: You're in the same class as Asakura Mihono, right?\r\nFutaba: Mihono... What about her?\r\nAkira: What do you think of her?\r\nFutaba: She's my rival!\r\nFutaba: Ahh, but, she's my rival, but we're friends too, and I guess if I had to say anything, she's a good person...\r\nFutaba: Basically... Yeah, she's my rival!\r\nAkira: ...What was your name again?\r\nFutaba: It's Futaba, Nagae Futaba.\r\nAkira: Futaba, huh. Keep at it. Nothing's wrong with anybody who keeps their buddy close.\r\nFutaba: Right! ...Actually, Inago-senpai, why were you asking about Mihono?\r\nAkira: I'm just, a little interested in her.\r\nAkira: (We're going to need the power she's got... So that our wish can happen...)\r\nFutaba: (EHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!? Sh-She's interested? Interested how!?)\r\nFutaba: (Don't tell me...

I'm sure backup will show up by then!\r\nToji: O-Okay...\r\nAradama: UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!\r\nToji: KYAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: You...! HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: Are you okay!?\r\nToji: Y-Yeah...

How's the situation?\r\nMihono: We're in big trouble!\r\nAkira: Is anybody hurt here?\r\nMihono: Nope!\r\nAkira: Alright, good to hear! Let's get straight to beating down these aradama!\r\nMihono: Right!\r\n\r\nMihono: I-I'm totally beat...\r\nAkira: What, that's all it takes for you to give up? You're such a lightweight.\r\nMihono: I was fighting the whole time waiting for you to get here, you know!\r\nAkira: Don't get mad at me. I came as fast as I could when I heard the news, alright?\r\nMihono: ...Thanks for coming to help.\r\nAkira: Alright, you're off the hook.\r\nMihono: ...You saved us by coming here, Akira-san.\r\nMihono: If you'd been just a little later... I think we would've been in real trouble.\r\nAkira: You should be thanking this then, not me.\r\nMihono: You mean... Your bike?\r\nAkira: Yep. It ran its heart out racing over here... Want to get on it for a bit?\r\nMihono: Can I!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Akira Joins: End]: Soon Enough\r\n\r\nMihono: Can I really!?

When you've had enough, get off.\r\nMihono: Ehhh!? You're not gonna let me ride anywhere with you!?\r\nAkira: It's not like I don't want you to, but we can't do it like this.\r\nMihono: Is it because... You don't have an extra helmet?\r\nAkira: More like, it's against the law. You can't ride with a passenger until a year after you've gotten your license.\r\nMihono: There's a law like that, huh...\r\nAkira: It's the kind of thing you wouldn't know about unless you had a license yourself.\r\nAkira: So, sorry 'bout this, Mihono.\r\nMihono: You pay attention to this stuff, huh, Akira-san.\r\nAkira: Huh? What're you talking about; 'course I do.\r\nAkira: Anyway, that's how it is, so it's not gonna happen today. Give it a few more months and I'll take you for a ride.\r\nMihono: You mean it!? It's a promise!\r\nAkira: Deal.\r\nMihono: Get a helmet ready for me too, okay!\r\nAkira: Who do you think you're talkin' to? I bought one of those back when I got my license!\r\nMihono: Oh, you did? Was it because there was somebody you wanted to ride with you?\r\nAkira: Just a buddy of mine.\r\nAkira: I thought maybe I'd show them how cool bikes were, and they'd get their own license.\r\nAkira: You're gonna try and get your license, right Mihono?\r\nMihono: I'm interested in trying!\r\nAkira: Bring it on!\r\nAkira: Bikes are the best! After you get your license, we'll go somewhere together!\r\nMihono: Okay!\r\nMihono: But, it's going to be a while before I can get my license, so before then, please let me ride on the back of your bike!\r\nAkira: 'Course!

I've made sure to let you know.\r\n\r\nThe day of the party.\r\n\r\nAkira: Why'd I have to get a suppression mission today of all days!?\r\nFukuda Sawano: The aradama are on the move, Inago-san!\r\nAkira: ORAA!\r\nAradama: UOOOO...\r\nSawano: If nothing else, you at least know how to handle yourself, Inago-san.\r\nAkira: Huh? What's that supposed to mean?\r\nSawano: No, nothing at all.\r\nSawano: At any rate, I'm glad you're here. Who'd have thought...\r\nSawano: Such a large aradama outbreak would happen.\r\nAkira: Tch. And just when I was thinking I'd made it to school on time for once!\r\nAkira: Oi, you mind if I just do my own thing here? I've got somewhere to be after this!\r\nSawano: Ordinarily I'd say we can't manage, but... Fine. We'll do what we can to support you.\r\nAkira: Sorry. I'll pay you back for this soon enough.\r\nSawano: Please deal with the aradama. That would be plenty.\r\nAkira: Count on me!\r\n\r\nAkira: That's finally over with!\r\nAkira: But, look how late it got... There's no way I'm making it on time.\r\nAkira: What's Yomi gonna say...\r\nSawano: Thank you very much for today, Inago-san.\r\nSawano: Especially for helping us on the day of the Miss Five Traditions recognition party.\r\nAkira: There's no getting out of it when it's my mission.

I mean, I went to school like normal too!\r\nAkira: But then I got sent on this mission all of a sudden, and up till now I was way out in the mountains suppressing aradama!\r\nYomi: That sounds like something you would do. Don't you think you could have refused, just for today?\r\nAkira: Huh? Between a mission and a party, 'course I'd deal with the mission first. What're you talking about?\r\nYomi: ...That is very like you.\r\nYomi: There's a dress ready for you.

I'll fill it up for you.\r\nSana: That's not alcohol you're holding there, is it?\r\nAkira: What, this? It's grape juice. See?\r\nSana: ......You're right, that's definitely grape juice.\r\nAkira: I am still a minor and all. This grape juice's pretty good too.\r\nSana: I think I heard we got it in from a winery.\r\nAkira: No wonder it's good then.\r\nSana: Inago, how have things been on your end lately?\r\nAkira: On what end?\r\nSana: You haven't been showing your face around Mokusa, have you?\r\nAkira: Things've been a little busy in our faction since the leader changed.\r\nSana: ...Her, hm.\r\nAkira: Yeah. ...I've gotta do what I can to back her up.\r\nSana: ...I see. Don't get in over your head at least.\r\nAkira: Not much I can do about that.

Approaching from 9 o'clock; be on guard.\r\nMihono: 9 o'clock? Wait, which way is that!?\r\nAkira: Left from where you're facing, Mihono!\r\nAkira: Yomi, are those the last of 'em?\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nAkira: Cool, let's finish this quick.\r\n\r\nPark Manager: Thank you very much. Now we can re-open for business.\r\nPark Manager: As a way to give our thanks, once the others are finished clearing out the aradama, would you like to enjoy our newest attraction?\r\nPark Manager: It's based around a theme of pirates and treasure hunting; \"Treasures of the Pirates\".\r\nPark Manager: And there were nine toji who came here today. You can make three teams of three, so it works out perfectly.\r\nMihono: ...!!\r\nAkira: Nah, we're good. That's a real nice offer, but we've got work to get back to.\r\nMihono: Akira-san...\r\nAkira: ...Or I was thinking, but, if you're gonna extend the favor, we should have some fun after all!\r\nMihono: If we're in teams of three, we can just stay in the teams we're in, so we can play as soon as the mission's over!\r\nPark Manager: Then, I'll arrange for that. We would appreciate it if you would give us your impressions once you're done as well.\r\nAkira: That's a small price to pay. Thanks for having us!\r\nMihono: I'll go let everybody know! And help them out too!\r\nAkira: Were you okay with this? You're probably busy.\r\nYomi: I don't mind. I can stay with you for today.\r\nAkira: You sure? Sorry. Though, if we're doin' it, we might as well have fun.\r\n\r\nAkira: You're lookin' pretty good as pirates! The three of us'll get that hidden treasure for sure!\r\nMihono: Aye aye sir! We have to go to the beach on the map straight away!\r\nAkira: Nah, first we're stealing the maps offa Yui and Suu! Loot and plunder! Cause we're pirates right now!\r\nMihono: Oh, yeah! The rules said we can do that too, didn't they.\r\nYomi: It seems only one team has the correct map to begin with.\r\nYomi: If we board the other ships and lower their pirate flag, they have to give up their treasure map.\r\nAkira: If we get all the maps, our odds of finding the treasure go up. And it sounds more fun than just going around looking, right?\r\nMihono: Yeah! It's totally more exciting!\r\nYomi: There is a time limit, so please don't forget that, you two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pirate - Akira: End]: Alriiight, We're Boarding!\r\n\r\nAkira: Yo, wanna have a little fun with us?\r\nAkira: Give us a minute and we'll get your flag down.\r\nYomi: That's how this will be, so excuse us.\r\nAkira: You gotta get more aggressive at times like these.\r\nYomi: ...That's not how I am.\r\nEllen: We were planning on picking a fight ourselves, but we were beaten to the punch.\r\nKiyoka: That's mostly Captain Yui's fault though!\r\nKiyoka: And also, where's Hono-chan...?\r\nAkira: You can tell by looking, so I'll say she's off on her own here.\r\nEllen: Is she protecting your flag? Or, is she sneaking over to ours. --One of those two, right?\r\nKiyoka: Since it's Hono-chan... She wouldn't sit still and watch the flag. So it might be down to the captain.\r\nEllen: I was thinking the same thing. Let's take out Inagon and Yomiyomi and get their flag, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Alright!\r\nAkira: I'm all for a fight! Let's do this, Yomi!\r\nYomi: Right.\r\n\r\nMihono: Aww... So Fukki's ship won in the end?\r\nKofuki: Well, on accident.\r\nMihono: But still-, that means there was no point in how hard we worked getting Yui's map, so it's twice as frustrating!\r\nAkira: Yeah, guess not.\r\nAkira: But y'know, it was pretty damn fun swinging around toy swords instead of our okatana for once, right?\r\nMihono: Yeah-- it was like I was back to playing around as a kid again!\r\nEllen: I get the feeling Kaoru would have fun playing this. Maybe I should invite her, when we get a day off.\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san would as well. After I tell her about today, she might be eager to come here.\r\nAkira: ......\r\nYomi: What is it?\r\nAkira: Nah, nothing. You'd wanna spend fun times with your buddies, wouldn't you.\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYui: Mannn, seeing Boss tearing around like a real pirate was so good!\r\nAkira:\u3000Thanks, Yui. ...Might as well ask, that's a compliment, right?\r\nYui: That goes without saying! I've got nothing but good things and more good things to say about girls!\r\nAkira: S-Sure. So, where was the treasure at anyway?\r\nHiyori: You'd better ask her about that.\r\nSuu: Eep... A-Ask m-me?\r\nAkira: Huh... Why'd she suddenly get all weird?\r\nYomi: Isn't that... because she's scared of the way you look like a bad person, Akira?\r\nAkira: It's not like I did anything to her... And anyway, that's pretty blunt of you. Kinda hurt.\r\nSuu: I-I'm sorry... Then, if you'll let me, I'll go over in detail how we found the treasure, to... to the best of my ability!!\r\nAkira: You don't gotta apologize.\r\nSuu: I'm sorry... Ah, ah, I'm sorry...! Then, I'll begin now, if that's okay...!\r\nAkira: Sure... Whenever you're ready. Just take it easy.\r\nAkira: (...Is it my highlights that're no good? The jacket? What's the problem...

About fifteen minutes ago, the gate to the netherworld began descending.\r\nSana: Evacuation orders have been sent out to Special Task Team units operating in all 23 wards, as well as all police and JSDF forces.\r\nSayaka: ...The sky, it's falling down.\r\nNene: Ne-...\r\nKanami: What's going to happen when it falls all the way down?\r\nSana: Beats me.\r\nKaoru: \"Beats me\", she says...\r\nYuzuki: To be honest, it's hard to grasp how much destruction it will cause.\r\nMai: But...\r\nFriedman: Try not to judge us so harshly here.\r\nEllen: Grandpa?\r\nFriedman: I know it doesn't make it easy on you all, but we really don't know a thing. At any rate, we've tried measuring with lasers, and differing frequencies of sound and radio waves...\r\nFriedman: But, whatever we try, we simply can't make any observations of what's happening on the other side of it.\r\nFriedman: Though, going from the fact that we can't observe it, we can naturally draw one conclusion.\r\nEllen: And, what conclusion is that?\r\nFriedman: That this is the very boundary between our world and the netherworld.\r\nHiyori: ...! Then, on the other side--\r\nFriedman: Yes, the netherworld is there.\r\nFriedman: The boundary between both worlds is already indistinct, and noro is seeping through. But that's far from our primary concern.\r\nFriedman: Tagitsuhime's objective is the collision of both our world and the netherworld, completely eliminating the boundary.\r\nKanami: The boundary will get destroyed...?\r\nKaoru: And, what happens then?\r\nFriedman: What we call the netherworld is a gathering point for the countless possibilities of our world; \"the many shadows of our reality\".\r\nKaoru: I'm not following you at all.\r\nNene: Ne-...\r\nFriedman: To give an example, you could think of the world we live in as a sugar cube, and the netherworld as a raging ocean.\r\nMai: A sugar cube and an ocean...?\r\nFriedman: That's right. Our world would easily melt away in it.\r\nFriedman: And we would find ourselves in a chaotic place, where our physical laws don't apply, and time and space are both unclear.\r\nFriedman: It would surely be the end of the world.\r\nYukari: ......\r\nKaoru: ...Guess that means we've gotta take her down after all.\r\nEllen: That's such a simple Kaoru kind of solution. Not that I dislike it though!\r\nSayaka: From the start, that's what we planned on.\r\nNene: Nene!\r\nYukari: All of you...\r\nHiyori: We don't have time. Let's go.\r\nSana: Ah-, hang on a sec. Have Asakura and them made contact with you?\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan...? Is she coming here!?\r\nSana: She is; I sent them your way as backup, but it sounds like they haven't made it yet...\r\nSana: Nothing we can do. Focus all your efforts on your own operation.\r\nYuzuki: --Etou, Kohagura, Mashiko, Itomi, Yanase, Juujou. And Yukari. You will not be given the order to retreat.

We're almost there too... Just a little farther and we'd catch up to Kanami and them--\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono! Setouchi Chie and I will handle this, while you go!\r\nChie: That's right! If we use the last of our strength, we should be able to cut open a path for Mihono-chan to get through!\r\nMihono: W-We can't do that! Just look at how many aradama there are!?\r\nMihono: I don't know if all three of us could even fight through them all, and you want me to leave you two here!?\r\nMirja: This is an order from your captain! Do not forget our mission!\r\nChie: And this is an order from your onee-san! You have to catch up to them, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: ...Both of you...\r\nMihono: ...Alright! I'll do it; I'll go! But, we'll see each other again for sure, okay! You have to promise!\r\nMirja: That goes without saying! Go! Asakura Mihono!\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie and I will clear a path for you! HAAAAAAAA!!\r\nChie: Now's your chance, Mihono-chan! Go on!\r\nMihono: Okay!\r\nChie: ...She's gone.\r\nMirja: Yes... Then...\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAAA-!\r\nMirja: Though... Truth be told, with this number of aradama, I'm not sure we can manage...\r\nChie: It doesn't matter if we can or can't. After all, Mirja, you promised her, didn't you?\r\nChie: We'll meet again, for sure. A captain isn't allowed to break a promise, are they?\r\nMirja: ...That's true. As her captain, hm... Then, by whatever means, we must break through!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Promise For Sure We'll Meet Again (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Pant... Pant... We did it... somehow... but, I can't...\r\nMirja: ...No, Setouchi Chie. I wish this weren't the case, but it doesn't seem to be over.\r\nChie: Eh...?\r\nGreat Aradama: GGGGAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nChie: A gr... great aradama...?\r\nMirja: ...I can no longer apply utsushi, or have the strength to wield my okatana. Setouchi Chie... Leave me, and escape on your own.\r\nChie: Sorry... Mirja. I can't move, any more...\r\nChie: Hey... Why are you, covering me with yourself...?\r\nMirja: I am your captain. Protecting my unit is my duty...\r\nChie: You promised, didn't you? That you'd see her again...\r\nMirja: But, we managed to send off Asakura Mihono.\r\nChie: Yes. As a toji, and as an onee-san, I can be proud of that...\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie. Thank you for everything.\r\nChie: ...Me too, thank you. Meeting everyone in the investigation team, I really enjoyed it...\r\nGreat Aradama: GGGGAAAAAAAAA!!\r\n\r\nYui: Just what do you think you're doing to my precious Chie-san and Mirja-san--!!\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui...?\r\nChie: What are you doing here!?\r\nYui: What are you saying! Whenever either of you are in a pinch, you know I'll be there at the speed of light!\r\nMirja: ...It doesn't seem to be a hallucination either...\r\nYui: Umm~! There's a ton of things I want to ask about! Like, why is it just the two of you! And, what happened to everybody else!\r\nYui: But for now, it's all going to be okay! Since you two are all worn out, please just sit there and watch me be your hero!\r\nYui: Don't blame me if you fall in love-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: In the Threshold (1)\r\n\r\nTagitsu: So you've come, toji. Your faces filled with determination.\r\nTagitsu: Oh...? An aradama joined the humans in coming here.\r\nNene: Nene?\r\nTagitsu: Aradama, will you not join me? Would the hunger in your soul not be satisfied?\r\nNene: NEE-!!\r\nTagitsu: Hmph, without even consideration... So an aradama of this world, who fell to man, will join their fate. Then...\r\nTagitsu: Why don't we share in the sight of this world's end together?\r\nEllen: Wow, you sure are starting to talk an awful lot more like a human.\r\nMai: Maybe that's the effect of her absorbing Takirihime and Ichikishimahime?\r\nKaoru: But, you know what? The last boss only gets put there so it can be beaten.\r\nNene: Nenne-!!\r\nSayaka: That's right. The world won't be destroyed. You will, Tagitsuhime.\r\nTagitsu: Were this only a dream.\r\nSayaka: --HAA!\r\nKaoru: KIEEEEEEEEEE!!\r\nTagitsu: --But, this is reality.\r\nEllen: You're wide open!\r\nMai: HAAA!\r\nTagitsu: --How foolish.\r\nMai: Gagh!\r\nEllen: Maimai-- Urgh!\r\nTagitsu: Even if the seven of you were to strike at me, you could not hope to touch me.\r\nTagitsu: Delightful... Come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: In the Threshold (2)\r\n\r\nKanami: YAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nHiyori: --HA-!\r\nTagitsu: Kh... The cornered rat tries biting back?\r\nTagitsu: But, that ends here.\r\n\r\nKanami: Where are we...!?\r\nYukari: The threshold between our world and the netherworld.\r\nYukari: The fact that we were drawn into it must mean there are only minutes before the boundary makes contact with the ground.\r\nTagitsu: This is true. The joining of this world and the netherworld is now an inevitability. Though, it is indeed regrettable you will be swallowed into it without this being settled.\r\nTagitsu: I'll allow you to enjoy the little time left till your last moment.\r\nMai: She raised the level of her jin'i!?\r\nHiyori: You're not getting away!!\r\nKanami: Wait!!\r\nKaoru: We need to go too!\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nEllen: Right!\r\nMai: I'm going--\r\nSayaka: Mai!\r\nYukari: .........\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: Three Rescuers (1)\r\n\r\nYui: But, wait...? If Chie-san and Mirja-san did fall in love with me, isn't that just what I've been hoping for?\r\nYui: ...Gyahn!\r\nMaki: What are you even talking about, at a time like this...!\r\nSuzuka: She certainly does have trouble reading the atmosphere.\r\nYume: Quit screwing around and start fighting seriously!\r\nChie: ...It's you!\r\nMirja: The former elite guard!\r\nSuzuka: You don't need to add the \"former\".\r\nMaki: Leave the rest to us! We'll take on the great aradama!\r\nYume: I'm going to show you a whole lot of what makes me so great here!\r\nYui: Ah-! I'm going to fight too, okay-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: Three Rescuers (2)\r\n\r\nMaki: It wasn't easy, but we managed to down it.\r\nSuzuka: Just as you'd expect from a great aradama...\r\nYume: You two are such a mess-. I can still keep going and going.\r\nYui: You sure are full of energy, Yume-san... How can you still have so much after fighting all those aradama...?\r\nChie: Um... Thank you, so much.\r\nMirja: However, why is Yamashiro Yui with the elite guard...?\r\nYui: Ahh! Right after I left Hana-san and the others with the rescue team, a request came in to pick up Yomi-san.\r\nYui: So, I volunteered to guard the rescue team on their way there! And then, I met up with the three from the elite guard! And, after that, I spotted you two getting attacked by that great aradama!\r\nYui: And that about sums it up!\r\nYui: See, Mirja-san! I did juuust like you told me! I didn't do anything too crazy, and made it back alive! See!\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui! Asakura Mihono... Have you heard anything of Asakura Mihono's current location!?\r\nYui: ...Mihono-chan? ...!!\r\nYui: Ahhh... That's why, you and Chie-san... And Kofuki-san and Kiyoka-chan too!\r\nYui: You all sent Mihono-chan forward to reach Kanami-chan and the others...!\r\nYui: Why did all of you go and do something so reckless!? You're the ones who told me not to do anything like that!\r\nSuzuka: I don't quite follow.\r\nMaki: Right... Why would it be that important to send Asakura Mihono to meet with Yukari-sama and the rest...?\r\nChie: Mihono-chan's okatana, Kashuu Kiyomitsu, has the potential to fatally wound a great aradama. Which means, even Tagitsuhime would...\r\nMirja: According to the Sword Administration Bureau's archives... that is. However, if the possibility exists, it is worth attempting.\r\nMirja: But... I've seen it with my own eyes. Asakura Mihono, wielding the power of Kashuu Kiyomitsu. It could--\r\nMaki: I see, I understand now.\r\nMaki: ...Yume! Catch up to Asakura Mihono, and go with her to Yukari-sama's side! Can you do that?\r\nYume: Not a problem~! I told you, I can keep going and going!\r\nSuzuka: But, you mustn't force yourself.\r\nYume: ...Nihi! Alright, I'll go and show everyone how great I am!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: The World of Jin'i (1)\r\n\r\nThe threshold of the netherworld, in the world of first level jin'i--\r\n\r\nHiyori: Kgh...\r\nKanami: HAH!!\r\nKaoru: KIEEEEEEEEEEEE!!\r\nTagitsu: Hnph!\r\nMai: She raised the level of her jin'i again!?\r\nKaoru: ...Sorry, this is as far as Ellen and I can go.\r\nNene: Ne-...\r\nEllen: Make sure you win, okay!\r\nMai: We will!\r\nSayaka: Mai! Let's go!\r\n\r\nThe threshold of the netherworld, in the world of second level jin'i--\r\n\r\nHiyori: HAA-!!\r\nKanami: YAA-!!\r\nMai: HAAH-!!\r\nTagitsu: --Fgh!\r\nMai: Grgh...!!\r\nSayaka: Mai-!!\r\nTagitsu: You move well at this speed... Entertain me, on and on through eternity in this moment.\r\nMai: Her jin'i went up another level... --I'll be fine! All of you, go on!\r\nKanami: Got it! Mai-chan! We'll see you later!\r\nMai: ...Everyone... Please be safe...\r\n\r\nThe threshold of the netherworld, in the world of third level jin'i--\r\n\r\nTagitsu: I hadn't expected that three of you would be able to follow me this far.\r\nTagitsu: You've done well, toji. This is the first time my heart has danced as such.\r\nHiyori: ...I pity you, Tagitsuhime.\r\nTagitsu: ...Hm?\r\nHiyori: I won't let you say you haven't noticed it. That deep loneliness, in the depths of your heart.\r\nKanami: Eh-?\r\nHiyori: Fusing with people made you aware of the fundamental loneliness in noro.\r\nTagitsu: Oh-...?\r\nHiyori: A child is formed when humans come together, and their nature and destiny continues to be passed down. Inherited, as Kanami and I did...\r\nHiyori: But, it's different for your kind. Noro, removed from the connected circle of life, is a lonely thing.\r\nTagitsu: We are unmatched. We have transcended the bounds of time. Such a circle is no...\r\nHiyori: That's true. Your kind isn't afraid of time. The only thing you fear is--\r\nHiyori: The okatana.\r\nHiyori: If you're cut apart by an okatana to the point that you can't maintain your intelligence, even if you were to reform, it wouldn't be you anymore.\r\nHiyori: Just a different aradama, with different memories and characteristics. That phenomenon makes you fear death the same as us living beings.\r\nTagitsu: ............\r\nHiyori: You have the same concept of death, but you're outside the circle of life. Wanting to cure yourself of that loneliness... No, realizing you can't be cured of it, here you are--\r\nSayaka: On a rampage. Because you're lonely... Because you want someone to be with you-- Like a child.\r\nTagitsu: You have no room to talk, toji. With those okatana in your hands, you have only slaughtered my kind--\r\nHiyori: That's right. All we're capable of doing is killing and exorcising you. We don't have the power to save you. That's why--\r\nHiyori: I'll go with you!\r\nKanami: They raised their jin'i again... Hiyori-chan!?\r\nSayaka: Fourth level jin'i... Kanami!\r\n\r\nTagitsu: With this, we enter the fourth level of jin'i. You are finally alone, Kogarasu toji.\r\nHiyori: That's what I was after from the start!\r\nTagitsu: Is that so. Then--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: The World of Jin'i (2)\r\n\r\nTagitsu: You've failed to strike me yet, I see.\r\nHiyori: Ggh...!\r\nTagitsu: Then, Kogarasu toji! Be slain here, in the momentary flow of time!\r\nTagitsu: --Wha-!?\r\nYukari: Surely you didn't... Forget about me, did you!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13: The Final Battleground (1)\r\n\r\nTagitsu: Gh, grgh...\r\nYukari: --Let's go, Tagitsuhime! To the depths of hell together!\r\nHiyori: -!? Yukari!?\r\nYukari: This time, it's my turn! Juujou!\r\nYukari: Now that I've stabbed Tagitsuhime, you will be the one to suppress her! That is your role, with the power of the Hiiragi you've inherited!\r\nTagitsu: YUKARIIIIIIIII!!\r\nYukari: --!?\r\nYukari: ...Kgh!! We've come this far...!!\r\nTagitsu: Heh... Your strength has failed you, has it...\r\nTagtitsu: Yukari... You are only human, after all. The effects of twenty years of resistance won't be erased so easily. --HMPH!\r\nYukari: GAGH...!!\r\nTagitsu: How pitiful, you had no chance to apply your utsushi.\r\nYukari: ...Juu...jou...\r\nHiyori: --Tagitsuhime!\r\nHiyori: ...Thank you, Yukari-sama.\r\nHiyori: But, this is my duty after all!\r\n\r\nMihono: Pant, pant... I finally made it... Up this building is where Kanami and them...\r\nMihono: Ahh... The sky keeps coming down more and more... I don't know what's going on up there...\r\nMihono: I heard this crazy noise up there earlier too. Maybe they're already fighting Tagitsuhime...\r\nMihono: I have to get there somehow!!\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAAAA-!\r\nMihono: Geh!? More aradama!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14: The Final Battleground (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Pant... Pant... This building... They made it way too complicated...\r\nMihono: The elevator wouldn't work, and there were places I couldn't get through cause rubble or aradama were in the way...\r\nMihono: I have to get to the roof fast... I have to get to Kanami, or else...\r\nMihono: I'm gonna make it! To wherever Kanami is...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: Unbelievable\r\n\r\nYui: Mmm~, that's what I'm saying! Since we took the same kind of ampoule, aren't we as good as family! As good as sisters!\r\nYui: In that case, after this is all over, and so we can deepen the bonds of friendship between us, we should freshen up in the bath together!\r\nMaki: Can you explain what she's even talking about? She's been like this the whole time.\r\nMirja: No... It's for the best that you ignore her, because it will surely be something unbelievable.\r\nChie: Yui-chan, you're like this even when dealing with the elite guard...? You're acting a little unbelievable right now...\r\nSuzuka: Does she always act like this...? That I find unbelievable...\r\nMaki: And you two work together in the same unit as a toji like this? You're unbelievable yourself...\r\nMirja/Chie: Sigh...\r\nYui: What's unbelievable is that such close friends as us wouldn't want to share a bath together!

Yui's stamina might be reaching its limit.\r\nAkira: Doesn't that go for you too? Your swings are losing their sharpness.\r\nHana: ...You could tell?\r\nAkira: How could I not?\r\nAkira: You ready?

We're not about to leave a single person behind either.\r\nHana: Right!\r\n\r\nMihono: Hmm, there's nobody around here.\r\nYui: It'd be a lot easier to search for people if we could shout for them, but then the aradama would come running...\r\nHana: We're just going to have to search place by place as we go.\r\n\r\nYui: Pant, pant...\r\nMihono: Are you okay?\r\nYui: Fine, just fine, I'm just so happy, surrounded by all these cuties.\r\nHana: If she can joke around like that, she must be fine.\r\nAkira: ...Shut up for a second.\r\nMihono/Yui: I-I'm sorry!\r\nAkira: Just shut up!\r\nAll Three: ......\r\nAkira: ......\r\nAkira: I knew I heard something.\r\nHana: Heard what?\r\n???: ......dy.\r\nMihono: Ah, someone's saying something!\r\nYui: Over that way!\r\n\r\nBoy: Ah...

This is on a whole different level.\r\nYui: That's cause it isn't so easy as just coming out here, beating all the aradama, and everything's okay.\r\nMihono: From now on... There's going to be a lot more disasters like this happening, won't there.\r\nMihono: And... A lot more people will get hurt...\r\nHana: That's what we're here for; to save as many of those people as we can.\r\nMihono: That's true...\r\nAkira: Is something on your mind?\r\nAkira: Go ahead and let me know then.

That's mostly how it is for them. Wanting to get tougher.\r\nMihono: -!? I think you might be right!\r\nAkira: In that case, you've got to challenge yourself. Do whatever's toughest, cause that's what's best for you.\r\nHana: (...Inago-san, she seems like the type who's good at looking after others. Calling her boss wasn't too far off the mark.)\r\nMihono: Whatever's toughest... Maybe I will transfer to the police.\r\nYui: You mean it!?\r\nYui: Between Hana-san and Mihono-chan, I'd have a pretty girl whichever way I look!\r\nAkira: Dumbass!

Fukuda-san, do you know where it was that Mihono-chan went to fight?\r\nSawano: If I remember... She should be at the shopping mall.\r\nMai: The shopping mall...\r\nSawano: You can go if you want.

Thank you, for your efforts the other day. What did you need?\r\nMihono: Err... About what you said, about transferring to a unit under the MPD's command, can I still do that!?\r\nEma: Of course, that would be fine, though... Did something happen?\r\nMihono: Yeah. I talked to Yui and Suzumoto-san, and Akira-san gave me advice... I made up my mind.\r\nEma: It sounds like you got the encouragement you needed.\r\nEma: I understand. In that case, starting today, you'll be transferred to the Metropolitan Police Department.\r\nMihono: Starting today!?\r\nEma: Yes. Ever since you asked to be sent to the mall, I've been expecting this to come.\r\nEma: The preparations were taken care of.\r\nMihono: Uwah... Is it really that easy to tell what I'm going to do?\r\nEma: I've seen a lot of girls like you, Asakura-san. For all of them, working with the MPD was a good experience.\r\nEma: I hope the same will be true for you, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: ...Okay! I'm going then!\r\n\r\nMihono: Hey, is Inago Akira-san here?\r\nSawano: If you're looking for Inago-san, she isn't here yet...\r\nMihono: Do you know how soon she'll be here?\r\nSawano: Hmmm, I'm not sure? There are plenty of times Inago-san doesn't even come to school...\r\nMihono: Oh, okay...\r\nMihono: (I wanted to thank her about what happened before school started...)\r\nMihono: (But I guess Akira-san's a delinquent after all.)\r\n\r\nAkira: Hello?\r\nAkira: Yeah, sorry. It wasn't in the plan, but I made contact with her.\r\nAkira: Mm... Yeah. There's no signs of her awakening yet.\r\nAkira: I think it's probably gonna take a bit more time.\r\nAkira: Yeah, got it.

I wasn't sure how things would go when we were getting shipped off to Gunma.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nKaoru: I wanted to grab something good to eat before heading back to the hotel, but really, what are the odds of finding something like that here in the uncharted wastes of Gunma? I'm morbidly curious.\r\nNene: Nenee...?\r\nSanae: Hey, hang on... Mashiko-san, Nene-chan, Gunma has its local delicacies too, you know!\r\nKaoru: Does it? Then, how about you prove it. Show me those delicacies.\r\nSanae: Leave everything to me. Gunma is where I'm from, after all.\r\n\r\nKaoru: Gunma... They're actually building cities here?\r\nSanae: Come on, even in the countryside we have towns that are this built up.\r\nKaoru: Well, making fun of Gunma aside. So? What do you suggest for lunch?\r\nSanae: How about mizusawa udon, or sauce katsudon? Which would the two of you prefer?\r\nKaoru: Udon, or katsudon... It's tough.\r\nSanae: The mizusawa udon gets my highest recommendation. When you slurp down those springy, slippery noodles, all coated in a soy or sesame sauce, it's just the best...!\r\nSanae: You'll never get tired of it, since the sauce always changes a little depending on where you go.\r\nKaoru: At the very least, I get that you love mizusawa udon. It's probably been a while since you came back here, so why not. Let's go with udon for lunch.\r\n\r\nKaoru: That was great-. They say local delicacies are never delicious, but there's plenty of exceptions, huh.\r\nNene: Ne~!\r\nSanae: And Nene-chan, even though you're an aradama, you still eat food, don't you. I was a little shocked after I first saw it.\r\nKaoru: He helps himself to whatever I'm eating, so I didn't get my fill...\r\nSanae: Then, what do you think about fried meat buns or gelato? For dessert.\r\nKaoru: Ooh, sounds nice. I'm interested in trying those fried meat buns.\r\nSanae: Then it's settled~.\r\n\r\nKaoru: Freshly fried is the best. I could get addicted to that sweet sauce too. After checking this place out, Gunma's not so bad. Looks like they have hot springs here too.\r\nSanae: I'm glad to hear you feel that way.\r\nSanae: Nene~.\r\nSanae: Fufu, are you liking it here too, Nene-chan?\r\nSanae: If only every aradama could be more like Nene-chan.\r\nKaoru: Nene was supposed to be pretty wild in the past too. But it'd be great if other aradama could be this laid back. Would save us the trouble of having to hunt them down on missions.\r\nNene: Nenenene~!\r\nSanae: Kya... Hey, Nene-chan, you're getting too playful. Bad Nene-chan! Okay?\r\nNene: Ne-...\r\nKaoru: He's been spoiled too much lately, which gets him a little overeager.\r\nNene: Nenene...\r\nSanae: (Watching Mashiko-san and Nene-chan together is sort of like seeing an older sister with her mischievous little brother...)\r\nSanae: (Getting along with aradama... It might be difficult, but, looking at these two, it might be an ideal partnership.)\r\nKaoru: Sanae, if he's ever bugging you, feel free to let him have it.\r\nSanae: Fufu, alright then. Nene-chan, let's get along together, okay?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: What is the Strength I Should Pursue?\r\n\r\nSanae: Isn't it amazing that Shidou-senpai went all the way to winning the championship match of the tournament? What kind of training did she do to for that, I wonder.\r\nClassmate: You're totally one of Shidou-senpai's fangirls now, huh Sanae? Not just with the tournament, but since you went to see her fighting in the qualifiers.\r\nSanae: I don't think I'm her fangirl...? I just sort of look up to her, because she's so cool.\r\nClassmate: Your homework for tomorrow is to think about if there's any difference there. Anyway, I should get going.\r\nSanae: Okay. I'll talk to you later.\r\nSanae: Now, what should I do? ...I guess I'll do some training after all, then head home.\r\n\r\nSanae: (What should I be doing to get stronger...?\u3000I keep practicing, but I don't feel any results.)\r\nSanae: Eh!? Over there, that's... Sh-Shidou-senpai!?\r\nMaki: Er, are you one of this year's new students?\r\nSanae: ...I-I am! First year in the middle school division, my name is Iwakura Sanae!\r\nSanae: Uhh... Um, Shidou-senpai... Congratulations, on winning the overall tournament!\r\nMaki: Thanks. The tournament must have a bigger reach than I thought, if I'm getting congratulated by a kouhai whose name I didn't even know a minute ago.\r\nSanae: I watched you fighting in the qualifiers here at Heijou! You looked incredible. You were so strong...\r\nMaki: Hearing that face to face... It's a bit embarrassing.\r\nSanae: Um, there's something I wanted to ask you about. Would that be alright?\r\nMaki: Sure, that's fine by me. So long as I can help you with it.\r\nSanae: What do I have to do, to be strong like you are?\r\nSanae: I want to get even stronger. But... Even if I keep training, I just don't know. What does it mean, to be strong?\r\nMaki: That's a tough question... Give me some time to think about it.\r\n\r\nMaki: I thought it over, but honestly, I'm still not sure what it means to be strong either.\r\nSanae: Shidou-senpai... You don't know either?\r\nMaki: Yeah. I can't give you a simple answer. But, \"to keep wondering what it means to be strong\", I feel like that itself is connected to what makes you strong.\r\nSanae: ...To keep on wondering, what it means to be strong.\r\nMaki: To find the kind of strength you're aiming for, I guess. If you can't find that, won't the path to getting stronger be needlessly difficult? ...I hope that can help you.\r\nSanae: Thank you very much; it helped a lot! I'm going to reflect on finding my own strength.\r\nMaki: Glad to hear it. I'll be going then. Let's both give it our best.\r\nSanae: Of course!\r\n\r\nSanae: (Today, for my first mission, I just had to do what I could to keep up with the more experienced toji... I was scared... There were times I couldn't do it like I practiced... But, thanks to my senpais, we still finished the mission.)\r\nSanae: (Someone got hurt, even if it wasn't too bad... Getting hurt is just a part of the job, that's what they told me. Still, it's a sad thing when someone is in pain.)\r\nSanae: (I want to make things as painless as I can. Which means I have to get rid of as many aradama as I can. Maybe I'm being too idealistic. But, still...)\r\nSanae: I think I need to reflect more on my own strength, like Shidou-senpai said.\r\nSanae: If I can find it someday... Will I be a strong toji then?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Form Conviction Takes\r\n\r\nSanae: (Juujou-san... She got in an argument with a classmate today... It makes me a little worried for her.)\r\nSanae: (It's been a few months since she transferred... It doesn't seem like she's made any friends yet. I feel like it's been a long while since I even saw her talking to anyone besides the teachers...)\r\nSanae: (If I can, I'd like to set her up to get along better with our classmates... But, would I just be bothering her...? Hmm.)\r\nSanae: Hm? I can hear something, over that way. I wonder what it is?\r\n\r\nHiyori: HAA...!\r\nHiyori: HNPH...!\r\nSanae: (There, practicing with a sword, isn't that Juujou-san?)\r\nSanae: (She really is passionate about it. But, in her hand... I haven't seen that one before, but that's...)\r\nSanae: ...An okatana?\r\nHiyori: Wh-Who's there!?\r\nSanae: Sorry, it's me. I thought I heard something, so I came to take a look.\r\nHiyori: ...\r\nSanae: That okatana, is it yours, Juujou-san...?\r\nSanae: It's rare to see a sharp edge on the backside of a sword.\r\nHiyori: That's right, the end of it is double-edged. It's an okatana made in an older time.\r\nHiyori: I got permission to take ownership of Kogarasumaru from President Gojou, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to anyone.\r\nSanae: Sure, I won't tell anybody. I promise.\r\nSanae: (...She was willing to tell me all about her okatana...!)\r\nSanae: (Maybe Kogarasumaru means a lot to Juujou-san. It might be a little unfair of me to attach a condition here, but...)\r\nSanae: But in exchange, and you only have to do it a little bit, but could you try getting along more with our classmates?\r\nHiyori: Sorry; that's not going to happen.\r\nSanae: ...But why not?\r\nHiyori: I'm going to be in the next year's tournament. To make that happen, I want to spend all the time I possibly can on training.\r\nHiyori: That's my current goal, as a toji.\r\nSanae: As a toji...\r\nHiyori: That's why, you should forget about me too, Iwakura-san. I don't care if people hate me for acting this way.\r\nSanae: (...She's not just stoic. For her to have that kind of determination...)\r\nSanae: I now understand why you're doing this.\r\nSanae: But, I'm still going to treat you the same as always. I couldn't hate you, Juujou-san.\r\nHiyori: ...I don't get it. [muttered]\r\nHiyori: ...Suit yourself. I'm going back to training.\r\nHiyori: ...HNPH!\r\nSanae: (She handles her sword without it wavering in the slightest... It's like the embodiment of Juujou-san's unshakable conviction.)\r\nSanae: (Her stance seems a little overbearing... But that could just be the shape in which her strength shows itself.)\r\nSanae: (Like I spoke to Shidou-senpai about; strength and conviction... Both things I still don't have.)\r\nSanae: I can't help but admire her... [whispered]\r\nSanae: (Juujou-san is so driven, but she's still the same age as us. Someday... I want to see her act more her age too.)\r\nSanae: (It'd be nice if I could get close enough to her that she'd let her guard down around me...)\r\n\r\n--The next day.\r\n\r\nSanae: Morning, Juujou-san.\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nHiyori: ...Good morning.\r\nSanae: !\r\nSanae: Fufu, let's do our best today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Juujou-san and Musumi-san\r\n\r\nSanae: Eh, Juujou-san is with Musumi-san? I wonder what they're talking about?\r\nKiyoka/Hiyori: ......\r\nSanae: Those two seem like they've been getting along together recently.\r\nSanae: (It makes me... A little curious.)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Ah, Iwakura-san! So you came by this way. I was just with Juujou-san until a minute ago.\r\nSanae: Mmhm. Musumi-san, you've been talking with Juujou-san a lot lately, haven't you?\r\nKiyoka: I-I have... With our alliance activities...\r\nSanae: Alliance??\r\nKiyoka: Ah, I mean... How should I put it... It's like an association, for kindred spirits...!?\r\nSanae: It sounds kind of fun. Could I join in?\r\nKiyoka: You want to be in our alliance?\r\nKiyoka: Hmmm... That's...\r\nKiyoka: ......!\r\nSanae: Eh...? What are you looking around my chest for... Musumi-san?\r\nSanae: (The way she's staring so intently... I-It's embarrassing.)\r\nSanae: Q-Question! ...This, alliance... What do you normally do?\r\nKiyoka: ...! Wh-What, do we do...? In the alliance?\r\nSanae: ...Right. You aren't doing anything strange, are you?\r\nKiyoka: N-Nothing strange at all!\r\nKiyoka: Umm... We often get together to come up with, ways to increase our development? In a sense...\r\nSanae: That does sound like Juujou-san... She's so introspective. Since my underclassman is working hard at it, then as a toji, I have to grow more too.\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nKiyoka: Well... If I had to say one way or the other, it's more about developing our bodies.\r\nSanae: Eh... That's what you meant!?\r\nSanae: S-Still... Juujou-san, with her tall figure, she does look very cool.\r\nKiyoka: I know what you mean... I do think she's cool...\r\nSanae: What other kinds of things do you do?\r\nKiyoka: We do stretches to stimulate ourselves, and share information on foods that are good for our bodies!\r\nSanae: Hmm, I think I'm interested in it after all, this alliance of yours.\r\nKiyoka: ...N-New members have to go through a strict inspection, so I can't say right now...\r\nSanae: Th-Then... I guess it can't be helped. By the way, is that book yours, Musumi-san?\r\nKiyoka: Yes, I had lent it to Juujou-san. I've been hooked on these romance novels lately--\r\nSanae: Eh!?\r\nSanae: (...J-Juujou-san, she reads romance novels!?)\r\nSanae: (Ah, thinking back, she was reading a book in the classroom too.)\r\nSanae: (Juujou-san... Silently reading a romance novel in the classroom, hmm... Maybe blushing to herself every now and then? It's surprisingly believable...)\r\nKiyoka: Is something wrong?\r\nSanae: S-Sorry... I didn't mean to shout like that. What's the title of that book?\r\nKiyoka: \"Heart's Recollection\"! If you'd like, do you want to borrow it?\r\nSanae: Thank you. I'm a little excited to read it now.\r\nSanae: (Next time I see Juujou-san, I can talk to her about romance novels, and ask her about her stretches!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: On That Day\r\n\r\n--The day before the tournament.\r\n\r\nSanae: We're finally here; in Kamakura.\r\nHiyori: Right. At last.\r\nSanae: A year ago, I never would have thought I'd be coming here as one of Heijou's representatives.\r\nSanae: (What Shidou-senpai told me, to think about my strength. What Juujou-san showed me, as she devoted herself towards her goal.)\r\nSanae: (I think... It's because I met these two, that I've grown enough to be part of tomorrow's tournament.)\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nSanae: I'm feeling nervous... What about you, Juujou-san?\r\nHiyori: ...I guess so. If I said I wasn't nervous, I'd be lying.\r\nSanae: I know just the thing. Since we came all the way to Kamakura, why don't we find something good to eat among the local delicacies?\r\nSanae: I think it'll be just what we need to help us relax.\r\nSanae: (Though, like usual, she'll tell me she doesn't need something like that.)\r\nHiyori: I'll be fine.\r\nSanae: (See. It sort of feels like her head is in the clouds right now.)\r\nSanae: Then, how about, after the tournament is over, we can stop by somewhere before we leave? I'll look for someplace nice.\r\nHiyori: ...Sure.\r\nSanae: ...!\r\nSanae: (Does this mean... After the tournament is finished, I can get closer to Juujou-san?)\r\nSanae: In that case, let's give it our best shot at the tournament tomorrow!\r\n\r\nSanae: ...I went and lost. Though, just making it this far is enough for me.\r\nSanae: (And, sure enough, Juujou-san will be advancing to the finals.)\r\nSanae: (That much isn't surprising. I don't have any idea how much effort she put into preparing for this. But, sometimes, I caught a glimpse of it.)\r\nSanae: (I don't think the other toji are weak. But, when it comes to Juujou-san-- I know she can do it!)\r\nSanae: Ah, I'd better get moving now.\r\n\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nSanae: (What is Juujou-san feeling, standing up there now?)\r\nSanae: (I wanted to talk to her before the finals started. I thought a lot about it... But, I never did.)\r\nSanae: (I wasn't sure what I would say either. All I knew was, at this time, she didn't need me to say anything... That's the feeling I got from her.)\r\nSanae: (So, after this match is over, I want to go talk to her.)\r\nSanae: (Hopefully, I'll get to say, \"Congratulations!\" and see her face light up--)\r\n\r\nThe referee signals the two who advanced to the finals to bow. The match is about to begin.\r\n\r\nSanae: (Juujou-san! You can do it--!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sanae Joins: Start]: The Curious Transfer Student\r\n\r\nSanae: (As the curtain closed on the tournament, with Shidou-senpai winning her second consecutive championship, around the time when spring was ending... That's when she arrived.)\r\nSanae: (A transfer student, a little outside of the usual season... Despite that, her skill as a toji was outstandingly superior. Everyone could plainly see it.)\r\nSanae: (That was what made all of us interested in Juujou Hiyori-san.)\r\n\r\nClassmate A: Hey, Juujou-san! You were amazing in today's practical training!\r\nClassmate B: I know, right? She could hold her utsushi longer than anybody in class too.\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nClassmate A: Oh yeah. After this, if you're free, there's a bunch of things I'd like to ask you--\r\nHiyori: ...Sorry, but I'm in a hurry.\r\nClassmate A: ...Eh? S-Sorry. We'll talk later?\r\nClassmate B: Did we... do something to make Juujou-san mad? What do you think, class rep?\r\nSanae: Hmm... I'm not sure. Maybe she's just not used to the class yet...?\r\nSanae: I'll try talking to her next time. I'd like to be her friend too.\r\n\r\nSanae: (But, that turned out to only be our wishful thinking...)\r\n\r\nSanae: Oh, Juujou-san. Why don't we get lunch together after this?\r\nHiyori: I'm fine... Just leave me alone.\r\nSanae: (Mmm... Another failed attempt today.)\r\nClassmate A: You're trying your hardest, Sanae.\r\nSanae: I am, but that's because I'm kind of worried. About Juujou-san.\r\nClassmate A: Still... You don't have to force yourself to talk to her, you know? Juujou-san seems like she prefers it that way too.\r\nSanae: Maybe you're right, but...\r\nClassmate B: At this point... Nobody talks to Juujou-san unless they have to.\r\nClassmate B: And most of the time, we can count on our class rep here to pass the important stuff along.\r\nSanae: Maybe... I am being too nosy after all.\r\nSanae: (...It's true that Juujou-san never goes out of her way to talk to anyone-- It looks like she does want to keep to herself... But.)\r\nSanae: (I don't... want to leave her all alone.)\r\nSanae: (If I don't do something, I'm not going to be able to change that--)\r\nClassmate B: I doubt you're going to change Juujou-san's mind, but isn't that okay? A class rep's supposed to be nosy.\r\nSanae: Eh?\r\nClassmate A: She might be stubborn, but isn't Sanae pretty stubborn herself?\r\nClassmate B: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see which of them gives in first.\r\nSanae: I-I'm not... I'm not that stubborn, okay?\r\nClassmate B: You say that, but... Right?\r\nClassmate A: Yeah. If that were the case, you wouldn't keep talking to her... She's seriously giving you the cold shoulder and all.\r\nSanae: Mmmm, it's not that I want to agree with you, but I'm going to try and do everything I can.\r\nSanae: (After all, if I just had the right chance, I might be able to shorten the distance between myself and Juujou-san.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sanae Joins: End]: Distance of the Heart\r\n\r\nSanae: Thank you for being my partner in practical training earlier, Juujou-san. I learned a whole lot from getting to cross okatana with you.\r\nSanae: Though, you were so fast I could barely keep up with you.\r\nHiyori: ...What do you want from me?\r\nSanae: Ahaha... Sorry for going on like that. I was wondering, is there any kind of trick to it? Like, some technique you use to stay so focused?\r\nHiyori: Isn't that something you should be asking the teacher?\r\nSanae: You're right about that, but, after seeing it for myself, I can't help but think, \"How'd she do that?\" You know?\r\nHiyori: There's no trick to it. Even if there were, I couldn't teach it to you.\r\nHiyori: ...If that's all you needed, then I'm leaving.\r\nSanae: Ah, okay.\r\nSanae: ......\r\nSanae: (Why is it... that Juujou-san tries to keep so much distance from everyone?)\r\nSanae: (Just by wanting to become a toji, she had to have known when she came here that working together with others was an essential part of stopping aradama...)\r\nSanae: (If I knew the reason why, I'm not sure if it would solve anything, but... The way things are now, it's difficult... In a lot of ways.)\r\nSanae: Maybe if I can just talk with her a little more...\r\n\r\nSanae: Thanks for helping clean up. Are you free after school, Juujou-san?\r\nHiyori: ...This again?\r\nSanae: I found a shop that sells tasty ice cream. So I was thinking, maybe we could go together...?\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nHiyori: No thanks... I'm busy with something.\r\nSanae: That's too bad. In that case, I can message you the name and location of the place for later.\r\nHiyori: ...What are you after? Did the teacher tell you to do all this?\r\nSanae: It's not like that. It's just, I want to be friends with you, Juujou-san.\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nHiyori: Sorry, but I don't feel the same way.\r\nSanae: Ah, Juujou-san?\r\nHiyori: ...Just forget about me. Can't you tell you're just wasting your time?\r\nSanae: That isn't the case for me... But I guess I'm bothering you after all?\r\nHiyori: ...I told you all I wanted to say.\r\nSanae: ...Juujou-san.\r\n\r\nSanae: Sigh... It isn't going very well at all...\r\nSanae: (I might be annoying her... But, if I leave her alone... It feels like she'll disappear somewhere.)\r\nSanae: (She reminds me a little of in elementary school, when a girl transferred away because of bullying. Especially with how things are in class...)\r\nSanae: (Of course, Juujou-san is strong. I can feel a strong kind of conviction in her. I might not be able to help Juujou-san, and she might not even need it if I could.)\r\nSanae: (But still...)\r\nSanae: Maybe I'm just being selfish, but I want to be friends with her.\r\nSanae: They say faith can move mountains, so I'll just have to keep going slow and steady. Mm!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/HguM1_W3fqw\r\n[Halloween 19 - Sanae: Start]: I'm a Bakeneko\r\n\r\nHiyori: You're going to be starring in a movie?\r\nSanae: I-I am.\r\nSanae: Umm, do you remember when Itomi-san was a stuntman for a movie that one time?\r\nSanae: It sounds like the staff from that movie made another request, and it was decided that I would be helping them together with Itomi-san and Kitora-san.\r\nHiyori: They probably picked Sayaka because of last time, but why were you chosen for this?\r\nSanae: I think it's because I fit their image for the part? My hair's naturally wavy.\r\nHiyori: Well, your hair does kind of have a life of its own... But what does that have to do with it?\r\nSanae: It has a lot to do with it! After all, the part I'm playing is a bakeneko, a cat demon! See, doesn't it look sort of catlike?\r\nHiyori: That's what you mean?\r\nHiyori: I've worn a catgirl costume before too, but my hair's like this.\r\nSanae: You were so cute back then, Juujou-san! You were all, \"I'm a catgirl, nya-!\"\r\nHiyori: I-I wasn't getting that into it!\r\nSanae: Huh, weren't you?\r\nHiyori: I was not!\r\nHiyori: Leaving that aside, so you'll be playing a bakeneko, huh... What kind of movie is it?\r\nSanae: It's a horror movie with action elements. I'm going to be fighting against Kitora-san.\r\nHiyori: Action between Iwakura-san and Mirja... It sounds like it'll be a great movie.\r\nSanae: You think so?\r\nSanae: This is my first time doing something like a movie... To tell the truth, I'm a little nervous.\r\nHiyori: Everybody goes through their first time at some point. Besides, knowing you, you'll play the bakeneko part with all you've got, right?\r\nHiyori: I think you'll be fine.\r\nSanae: ...Thank you! I'll give it everything I've got!\r\nHiyori: Sure. Anyway, when are they doing the filming?\r\nSanae: That would be... On Halloween day.\r\nHiyori: ...Oh. So then you won't be there with me on Halloween.\r\nSanae: That's what I regret most about this...\r\nSanae: I really wanted to see you in your vampire costume...\r\nHiyori: You don't have to be that depressed about it. You can still see it, like in pictures.\r\nSanae: That sounds perfect! You have to send me pictures, okay! I want to see shots of you and Etou-san together!\r\nHiyori: Why do they have to be me with Kanami!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Halloween 19 - Sanae: End]: On to the Filming!\r\n\r\nThe day of the film shoot.\r\n\r\nSanae: The weather doesn't look too good, does it.\r\nMirja: That's true, Iwakura Sanae. However, for a horror film, this might actually be considered good weather.\r\nSanae: Ah, you have a point there.\r\nSanae: But, all the same... They really are going to start filming, aren't they. I wonder if I can do this right...\r\nMirja: Are you feeling nervous?\r\nSanae: Extremely nervous!\r\nSanae: Itomi-san, what was it like for you the last time you did this?\r\nSayaka: What was it like?\r\nSanae: Did you feel nervous at all, and things like that. I need to use you for reference!\r\nSayaka: For reference...\r\nMirja: Is something the matter with that?\r\nSayaka: I don't know what to do, if you say you want to use me for reference... ...I don't really remember last time.\r\nSanae: Eh-!? You don't remember it!?\r\nSayaka: I just moved like they told me to, and then it was over before I noticed. That's why I think it'll go fine this time too.\r\nSanae: Sh-She's a real big shot...\r\nStaff: It's showtime-. Iwakura-san and Kitora-san, please stand by for your scene-.\r\nSanae: I-It's already starting!?\r\nSayaka: You can do it, Sanae.\r\nSanae: Y-Yeah... I'll do what I can!\r\n\r\nSanae: ...[gulp]\r\nSanae: (Right now, Kitora-san will be coming up from the first floor, so I have to frighten her...)\r\nMirja: I-Is somebody there?\r\nSanae: (Ahh, I'm so nervous I can't stop myself from smiling...! I have to stiffen up my face some more...!)\r\nMirja: [pant, pant]...\r\nSanae: (Mirja-san's raising the sense of tension... She's a good actor...)\r\nSanae: (I-I'll have to try and keep up with her performance... One, two, and three...!)\r\nSanae: UNYAAAAAA!\r\nMirja: KYAAAAAAAAA!\r\n\r\nStaff: Okay, that's a wrap-.\r\nSanae: Ahh, that was so nervewracking...\r\nMirja: You did well, Iwakura Sanae. That was a good performance.\r\nSanae: Thanks a lot, Kitora-san! I can't wait for it to be in theaters!\r\nMirja: I understand the feeling. When that time comes, let's go and see it together.\r\nSanae: Sure!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/yL8kaMSJQzo\r\n[Xmas' 20 - Sanae: Start]: What Should I Go With?\r\n\r\nSanae: A Christmas party?\r\nHiyori: Yeah, Kanami and everyone invited me, but, do you want to come too, Iwakura-san?\r\nSanae: Thanks for the invitation, Juujou-san.\r\nSanae: But... Is it really okay for me to be there?\r\nHiyori: Of course it is.\r\nSanae: Then, I'd be happy to go.\r\nHiyori: Great.\r\nHiyori: Ahh, that's right. We're going to be exchanging gifts that day, so be sure to have one ready.\r\nSanae: Okay!\r\n\r\nSanae: ...I said that, but, a gift exchange?\r\nSanae: Etou-san, Juujou-san, Yanase-san, Itomi-san, Kohagura-san, Mashiko-san...\r\nSanae: Hmm... What would be good to give them? Would it be okay if I just picked out something I liked?\r\nKiyoka: Oh, Sanae-san?\r\nSanae: Musumi-san...\r\nKiyoka: I didn't expect to see you here! Are you out shopping?\r\nKiyoka: The investigation team is having a party on Christmas, so I'm here to buy some things!\r\nSanae: I'm sort of in the same boat.\r\nSanae: I'm going to a party with Juujou-san, but they're going to be doing a gift exchange there, so...\r\nSanae: ...\r\nSanae: Could I ask you for a bit of advice on something, Musumi-san?\r\nKiyoka: Ah, sure, of course. If I can help.\r\nSanae: You see... I'm actually worried about what to get for the gift exchange. If it were you, what would you buy?\r\nKiyoka: Hmm... That is a little tough to pick something out for.\r\nKiyoka: If it were me... Let's see... I think I'd probably go with something consumable or that you could eat.\r\nKiyoka: Because then, it would be fine no matter who gets it.\r\nSanae: That makes sense... Thanks, Musumi-san.\r\nKiyoka: Don't mention it! Good luck finding the right present!\r\nSanae: Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Xmas' 20 - Sanae: End]: I Don't Feel Like I Can Lose\r\n\r\nAradama: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nMan: UWAHHHHHHH!?\r\nSanae: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMan: Th-Thank you!\r\nSanae: Are you hurt anywhere?\r\nMan: I-I'm fine.\r\nSanae: Thank goodness... Then, please evacuate calmly!\r\nSanae: I'll make sure to protect everyone!\r\nMan: Sure, we're counting on you, miss Toji!\r\n\r\nHiyori: This turned into one mess of a Christmas.\r\nSanae: Juujou-san... There's not much we can do about it; aradama don't care if it's Christmas.\r\nSanae: But, did you finish getting everyone evacuated over there?\r\nHiyori: Yeah. I came over to help you out, though... it looks like things are fine here.\r\nSanae: Just about. You should go over to see how the others are doing.\r\nHiyori: Got it.\r\nHiyori: Ah, by the way. When we get back, could I give you my present?\r\nSanae: ...Eh?\r\nHiyori: We're probably not going to be having a party at this point, but... I'm pretty confident in the present I chose.\r\nSanae: ...Okay.\r\nSanae: Ah, could I ask you what you picked out?\r\nHiyori: Christmas wagashi.\r\nHiyori: There were lots of cute looking ones, so I had a hard time narrowing it down.\r\nSanae: I'll bet... I'll look forward to it.\r\nSanae: And then, I'll trade you my gift, Juujou-san. I went through a lot of ideas, but I settled on a handkerchief...\r\nHiyori: I'll be sure to take good care of it.\r\nHiyori: Anyway, I'll see you later.\r\nSanae: Okay!\r\nAradama: GYAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nSanae: An aradama!?\r\nSanae: Though... I wonder why.

They're all at the bottom of each segment.]\r\n\r\n1: The Photo Room\r\n\r\n???: ...Kaoru, come on and wake up...\r\nKaoru: Quit shaking me... I've got expedition duty tomorrow... I'm sleeping in until the sun sets today...\r\nEllen: Just wake up already!\r\nKaoru: ......Where are we?\r\nEllen: Good morning, Kaoru! Now everyone's awake!\r\nKaoru: ...Ahh, figures you were behind this. You know, Ellen, if you're kidnapping someone, the prank's gone too far.\r\nEllen: What led you to that conclusion!?\r\nEllen: I'm not the one who did this! When I woke up, I was just in this room too!\r\nKaoru: ...Wait, what. Why'd something this annoying have to go and happen.\r\nKaoru: Did the rest of you wake up in here too?\r\nMihono: Yeah... I remember eating with Kiyoka and Fukki, and then...\r\nKiyoka: I felt sleepy all of a sudden... When I woke up, I was here.\r\nKofuki: Yeah. Don't remember anything else.\r\nMirja: Something similar happened to me. What about you, Konohana Suzuka and Tsubakuro Yume?\r\nYume: Uhh...? Suzuka-onee-san, do you remember anything?\r\nSuzuka: Not a single thing. We all seem to have been in different circumstances, but the common factor is that none of us remember how we got here.\r\nKaoru: Somebody's going around kidnapping toji? I bet our presid-- our old hag finally made someone snap.\r\nSuzuka: You're taking this situation in stride. Do you have experience in being kidnapped?\r\nKaoru: Who would...? What I'm thinking is, there's two of the elite guard here.\r\nKaoru: So they must be searching for us like crazy right about now.\r\n???: Oh no! Oh no! At this rate, Wonderland will be gone for good!\r\n???: ...But, wait? Why was it going away again?\r\n???: Oh no! Oh no!\r\nMihono: That voice, that's Chii-nee!\r\nKaoru: Chie's here... Forget searching for us, I guess we're already safe. Does that mean we can just go back to sleep now?\r\nSuzuka: We have our duties as the elite guard to consider, so I'd like to make my way out.\r\nSuzuka: And besides... Given the situation, it might be amusing to play along.\r\nMihono: We want to get out of here fast too. We were about to go see a movie!\r\nEllen: Then, we're going to have to figure out how to leave this place!\r\nEllen: The only way out of the room is through this locked door. There has to be a key around here somewhere.\r\nMirja: I don't see any key, however... There is a photograph on the table.\r\n[Q0]: (There is a photo of Kaoru, Mihono, Kiyoka, Kofuki, Yume, Ellen, Mirja, and Suzuka...)\r\nMirja: On the backside there is the letter \"Q\"... Does it mean \"Question\"?\r\nYume: Are they saying we have to answer the question if we want to leave the room?\r\nEllen: Oh! It's an escape room game!\r\nYume: The answer's easy peasy! It's eight people!\r\nYume: Ehhh, why was that wrong? Wasn't the question how many people were in the picture?\r\nSuzuka: Yume, we mustn't jump to conclusions. You should think a little longer about the question before answering next time.\r\nEllen: Hmmm... They're really making this difficult, not writing out the question.\r\nMirja: This is only my assumption, but it's likely the answer would be too easily discovered if the full question were written out.\r\nKofuki: Which means the answer's easy. This'll be fun; let's see Mihocchi give it a shot.\r\nMihono: Me!? Umm, umm... I-Is it one of those ones where you spot the differences?\r\nMihono: Like we compare the picture to how things are in the room now, and see if anything's different... Or something.\r\nKofuki: Oh, that's a way better idea than I was expecting. So, what's different?\r\nKiyoka: Hmm, it all looks the same to me...\r\nMihono: These things usually have more than one difference, and they just keep getting harder, right?\r\nMihono: So I think there should be one or two easy ones... Is the answer that the desk is bigger?\r\nMirja: That seems to have been wrong?\r\nMihono: That's weird... They gave us a photo, so I was sure they were asking what was different...\r\nKofuki: Maybe that's a trap?\r\nKofuki: If Chichie made this, then we've gotta see through her tricks.\r\nEllen: This is exciting; it feels like we're getting closer to figuring it out!\r\nEllen: See through... What if it's that we're all awake, or that there's no photo on the table?\r\nKofuki: There's two answers that sound good enough, Mihocchi.\r\nMihono: Going by my intuition... The answer is, we're not asleep now!\r\nKiyoka: KYAA!?\r\nKofuki: Why'd the lights go out... Hey!? Mirja's not here anymore!\r\nKofuki: Huh...? This is, Mirja's glasses, and a watch...?\r\nMihono: Don't tell me... Because we got it wrong, Mirja-san got turned into glasses!?\r\nSuzuka: Sigh... Don't be ridiculous. It seems that, after a certain number of mistakes, one of us is eliminated.\r\nKaoru: In that case, the time left on here is our time limit? 100 minutes... Feels like we could use it all on this question.\r\nEllen: Don't worry. If this is an escape room game, there's sure to be some kind of hint in the room.\r\nMihono: Did anyone see a hint anywhere?\r\nKiyoka: No, I don't think there's any...\r\nEllen: Really?\r\nKaoru: Come up with something more than \"Really\"!\r\nSuzuka: There's aradama!?\r\nKofuki: Least they brought something to keep us from getting bored in here! I'll take care of all of them!\r\nYume: No fair, Onee-san! Let me have some too-!\r\nSuzuka: A playing card fell out of it... Oh? Something's written on it.\r\nEllen: There it is!\r\nEllen: Seems like the aradama must have taken our hint.\r\nSuzuka: The spectrum finder is still getting a reading... This won't be settled so easily.\r\nSuzuka: Let's gather all the hints we can.\r\nYume: Aha, this is more fun than regular aradama fighting~.\r\n\r\nHint 1: \"Don't let them get in the way of our rampage!\"\r\nHint 2: \"If only they weren't around!\"\r\nHint 3: \"Our natural enemy!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Eight White Rabbits Room\r\n\r\nEllen: I get it now. The answer is... \"Toji\"!\r\nYume: Ah, a key fell down!\r\nEllen: Now we can move on to the next room! Let's go see what the next question is!\r\n\r\nMihono: This room... It looks just like the last one, doesn't it? Maybe there's another photo lying around?\r\nKiyoka: I don't think they would use the same question twice in a row...\r\nYume: Onee-sans, there's two letters on top of the table.\r\nYume: The first one has the question, and the second... What is this?\r\nLetter from the White Rabbit: Help us, Miss Toji! Defeat the aradama, and protect Wonderland!\r\nSuzuka: Aradama have appeared in Wonderland, and they've brought toji in to help... I suppose that's the story here.\r\nSuzuka: What does the question say?\r\n[Q1]: Two Dumptys, Five Tweedle Dums and Tweedle Dees, and six Humptys chased the eight White Rabbits.\r\nYume: \"Two Dumptys, Five Tweedle Dums and Tweedle Dees, and six Humptys chased the eight White Rabbits\"...?\r\nSuzuka: Why are Humpty and Dumpty written separately...?\r\nYume: Did you figure something out, Suzuka-onee-san?\r\nSuzuka: No... It's only that, Humpty Dumpty is one character.\r\nSuzuka: Humpty and Dumpty shouldn't be treated as two separate things...\r\nEllen: And there's way too many people too!\r\nEllen: There weren't eight white rabbits, or anywhere near that many Tweedle Dees and Dums!\r\nKiyoka: Without the question written out, I'm at a loss... I don't know what kind of answer they want.\r\nSuzuka: ...There aren't any hints in this room either, are there.\r\nKofuki: Does that mean there's gonna be more aradama-chan coming in here? This is the best!\r\nKofuki: Alright, Mihocchi! I'll get the clues for you, so you're in charge of solving the question!\r\nMihono: Eh-!? You have to solve it with me, Fukki-!\r\nKofuki: We've gotta split up the work. Since you didn't help at all with the last question, you've gotta try extra hard with this one.\r\nMihono: I-I'll try!\r\nMihono: Uhh... There's eight white rabbits, right? So, maybe the Humpty Dumpties made... body... doubles?\r\nKofuki: What, like Humpty Dumpty's a ninja? You want to go with that answer?\r\nMihono: ...Y-Yeah. Ah, we can make up to two mistakes, right?\r\nYume: We knew that was wrong before she even said it! Why didn't you stop her, Suzuka-onee-san?\r\nSuzuka: There's hardly a reason to get angry over one or two mistakes. So long as the final answer is correct.\r\nSuzuka: You should think up with an answer with us, Yume.\r\nYume: I'm helping with beating the aradama, so you can answer the quiz questions, Suzuka-onee-san!\r\nEllen: Don't be like that, Yumecchi. I bet it'll be a lot of fun to figure it out for yourself!\r\nYume: Then at least give me a hint. It's too hard; I don't really get it.\r\nEllen: Hmm, this is a tough one. We need something to set us on the right path.\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOO!\r\nEllen: Yumecchi, there's aradama!\r\nYume: Did they come to give us a hint!? HAAAAAAA!!\r\nKofuki: Ah, wait up, Yume... Hey, there's none of them left for me!\r\nYume: That's your fault for being a slowpoke, Onee-san.\r\nKofuki: Huhh!? Who're you calling a slowpoke!?\r\nSuzuka: And the hint... I see, so that's what they want.\r\nKiyoka: Oh, this tells us how to answer it! With this, we just have to...\r\nMihono: Kiyokaaa... Even with the hint, I don't get ittt...\r\nSuzuka: You need to focus more on your studies, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: Uuu...\r\nEllen: Hang in there, Mihomiho!\r\n\r\nHint 1: There is a hidden word.\r\nHint 2: whiterabbit\r\nHint 3: dumpty\r\nHint 4: tweedledum\r\nHint 5: tweedledee\r\nHint 6: humptY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Treasure Room\r\n\r\nEllen: The answer is \"Buddy\"!\r\nEllen: [White rabbit] is \"White Rabbit\"! And there were eight of them, so we pick out the eighth letter: \"b\"!\r\nEllen: If we keep picking out letters of the alphabet like that, then line them up in order, we get... Buddy!\r\nYume: ......\r\nSuzuka: What is it, Yume? You're pouting like something's the matter.\r\nYume: I thought this was boring, but I'm sorta frustrated that I couldn't figure it out...\r\nYume: I'll be the one to answer the next question, okay!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: In this room too, they left two letters for us. Let's see...\r\nLetter from the White Rabbit: Ahh!? My treasures were scattered all about!!\r\nKiyoka: Treasures...? Is the question this time about finding treasures?\r\n[Q2]: MITSU TSUGU tsu ha SUI YASU no JIN ZEN GIRI ru no ya ECHI KANE ki\r\nKiyoka: Umm, \"mitsu tsugu tsu\"...?\r\nYume: Let me have it, Onee-san! ...The heck is this!?\r\nMihono: I want to see too, Tsubakuro-san! ...Whoa, my head hurts.\r\nYume: There's supposed to be treasures hidden in here, right? Treasures... Treasures...\r\nYume: There aren't any treasures anywhere!\r\nMihono: Hang on, Tsubakuro-san! At times like these, you're supposed to go with \"tanuki\", right!\r\nYume: Are you being serious, Onee-san? There's not even a picture of a tanuki anywhere, and there isn't even a \"ta\" to start with.\r\nMihono: Ah... Uhh, th-then, let's just take out all the capitalized letters to start!\r\nYume: Ehh, should we really mess around with it that much?\r\nEllen: That's one way of thinking about it. If we take out all the uppercase... Tsu ha no ru no ya ki?\r\nMihono: Tsuha no Runoyaki? If you read it backwards... Kiya no Runohatsu?\r\nYume: Is that a treasure?\r\nMihono: Maybe it could be...?\r\nSuzuka: It isn't going to be so sim... Hm? Hang on...\r\nYume: Ahhh! Wait, stop, Suzuka-onee-san! I'll come up with the answer, so you don't say anything!\r\nSuzuka: ...Very well then.\r\nMihono: Let's solve it together, Tsubakuro-san!\r\nYume: Why? I'll be the one to solve it, so you can just sit down, Onee-san.\r\nMihono: Don't be like that; won't it be more fun to figure it out together?\r\nKofuki: I've been waiting for this, aradama-chan!\r\nMihono: Tsubakuro-san! We should fight the aradama too, so we can get a hint!\r\nYume: I can solve it on my own. Suzuka-onee-san didn't need a hint, so I don't either.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, there's the hint! The hint for this question is...\r\nMihono: Don't read it out loud, Kiyoka! I'm still thinking!\r\nMihono: Tsuha no runoyaki, tsuha noru no yaki...\r\nYume: Oh, I got it!\r\nMihono: Ahh!? Tsubakuro-san, don't say it!\r\nYume: Ehh, but if we had to wait on you, Onee-san, the time would run out.\r\nMihono: If it comes down to this... Kiyoka! Show me the hint!\r\nKiyoka: Here you go, Hono-chan.\r\nMihono: Okay, okay... Mm? Wait, I already know there's treasures, but...\r\nEllen: In that case, how about this hint?\r\nMihono: Umm... Ah! So that's how it is! To get the answer, we just have to do this, right?\r\n\r\n\r\nHint 1: There are three treasures.\r\nHint 2: Toji come with what?\r\nHint 3: Sort them out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Break Room\r\n\r\nYume: The answer is \"Sohayanotsuruki, Suijingiri Kanemitsu, Echizen Yasutsugu\"!\r\nEllen: Sohayanotsuruki is Chie's, Suijingiri Kanemitsu is Yomiyomi's, and Echizen Yasutsugu is my okatana!\r\nKaoru: Is there some reason why it's those three?\r\nEllen: I wonder about that...? It is interesting, but for now, let's move on forward!\r\n\r\nKaoru: So, in this room we've got another two letters... And next to them, some cakes.\r\nLetter from the White Rabbit: Only a little bit further to the boss! But before that, take a quick break!\r\nEllen: Does that mean we can eat these cakes?\r\nMihono: Nice-! Which one should I have?\r\nYume: I want this shortcake here. I'm gonna try it-!\r\nSuzuka: Stop right there.\r\nSuzuka: I don't believe they'd leave us these cakes without some deeper reason.\r\nKofuki: You're overthinking it. They told us we could eat them, so what's wrong with it?\r\nSuzuka: They did not say we could eat them. Mashiko-san, what is the question this time?\r\nKaoru: It's right here.\r\n[Q3]: A: eaiohinebtehexo B: tlewtohaercherm C: ascfasttloatnto\r\nMihono: \"Eaiohinebtehexo\"...\r\nKofuki: \"Tlewtohaercherm\"...\r\nYume: \"Ascfasttloatnto\"?\r\nKaoru: I don't get it. Must be because I don't have enough sugar in my system. Maybe we ought to eat some cake after all.\r\nEllen: I know! I've got a good idea! Let's make it a competition!\r\nKiyoka: A competition?\r\nEllen: Yes! The first person to solve the question gets to eat the cakes!\r\nSuzuka: I don't see anything wrong with that. If we don't put some restriction on it, someone may eat the cake out from under us.\r\nYume: ...We just have to solve the question first? Then, I'm gonna figure it out before anybody else!\r\nMihono: Kiyoka, let's figure it out together! Then we can split the cakes!\r\nKiyoka: Okay! I'll do my best, Hono-chan!\r\nKaoru: You okay with this, Ellen? These cakes are the ones from that bakery you love so much, aren't they?\r\nEllen: Of course I am! Rather than eating them normally, eating them after I've won them is going to make them taste that much better!\r\nSuzuka: Now then, what connection is there between A, B, and C... Reading them in reverse... It doesn't seem to mean anything.\r\nYume: WAAH-! Don't do that, Suzuka-onee-san! If you try hard to solve it, you'll figure it out right away!\r\nSuzuka: That's the nature of the competition. I'm not about to hold back on you, you know.\r\nYume: Suzuka-onee-san's getting serious!\r\nSuzuka: Though, in spite of that... However I look at it, I can't find the answer.\r\nSuzuka: From the way that it's listed out, there must be some way to read it...\r\nEllen: Hmmm, I'm not sure how though...\r\nEllen: Judging from the previous rooms, there should be something simple we aren't getting that will make it solvable...\r\nSuzuka: Something simple...\r\nEllen: Ah! Eavesdropping is off limits, Hanahana!\r\nSuzuka: Come now, don't put it so harshly. You said it loud enough for me to overhear.\r\nSuzuka: The alphabet... Removing any repeated letters... Hmm, they all seem to be wrong.\r\nKofuki: It's aradama-chan time!\r\nYume: I'm going to get the hints!\r\nMihono: Kiyoka, we have to try too!\r\nKiyoka: Right!\r\nEveryone: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nYume: Umm... What is this? This hint's no good!\r\nYume: Onee-san, give me your hint!\r\nKofuki: Ahh, sure. Here.\r\nYume: Thanks! ...Wait, what are you supposed to do with this!?\r\nMihono: Ahhhhh, Fukki, how could you... Kiyoka, what about your hint!?\r\nKiyoka: Don't worry, Hono-chan! This should be enough!\r\nYume: Ahh, you onee-sans can already solve it!? Suzuka-onee-san!\r\nSuzuka: Oh my, are you coming to me for help?\r\nYume: If they're going to split the cakes in half, we can do that too!\r\nSuzuka: What am I ever going to do with you. Then, let's not waste time... Ahh, so that's how it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nHint 1: From the start.\r\nHint 2: In order.\r\nHint 3: A>C>B\r\nHint 4: Vertically.\r\n\r\n\r\n5: The Traitor Room\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Yume, you may eat a piece of whichever cake you like.\r\nYume: Huh? But we still haven't solved it yet!?\r\nMihono: Konohana-san's cheating!?\r\nSuzuka: You do speak so poorly of me. But eating a piece of cake is the solution.\r\nKofuki: Huh? Why's that the right answer?\r\nSuzuka: That's how it was written. If you try reading them all at once, top down from A to C to B, you'll understand.\r\nKofuki: \"Eat a slice of what is on the table to reach the next room\"...\r\nKaoru: Kaoru: If somebody'd just snuck in a bite, we would have solved this easy.\r\nMihono: Ah, that's true...\r\nKiyoka: B-But, in that case, we wouldn't have realized we solved it...\r\nSuzuka: Now then, let's move on to the next room. If the other letter was correct... The next may be the final room.\r\n\r\nAradama: BUUUOOOOOOOO!\r\nMihono: The boss is an aradama!?\r\nEllen: There's no way they'd leave aradama here as the boss!\r\nSuzuka: Kohagura-san is right. Before we can solve that mystery, we'll have to defeat these aradama!!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: The spectrum finder isn't reading anything anymore.\r\nKofuki: What, is that all of them?\r\nYume: They were way too weak! I didn't get to have any fun at all.\r\nYume: And anyway, they didn't give us a hint card either; we got a letter instead.\r\n[R]: There is a traitor among you. Listen to the white rabbit to find who can stop them!\r\nSuzuka: This means...\r\nKiyoka: One of us in here is a traitor...?\r\nMihono: W-Well it's not me!?\r\nKofuki: You sure about that? Chichie's the one setting this up, right? I'm thinking that makes Mihocchi the number one suspect.\r\nKiyoka: Kofuki-san, your smile's giving it away.\r\nKofuki: Ah, seriously!?\r\nMihono: Huh? Wh-What do you mean, Kiyoka!?\r\nKiyoka: It means she never actually thought you were the traitor.\r\nKiyoka: After all, there's no way Hono-chan could keep up an act for that long, is there?\r\nMihono: Th-That's true! Thank goodness...\r\nYume: Then the traitor's gotta be Suzuka-onee-san, right? Suzuka-onee-san's a good actor, isn't she?\r\nSuzuka: True, I think I could manage it. However, I am not the traitor.\r\nYume: Are you lying...?\r\nSuzuka: I am not! More importantly, \"find who can stop them\"... That part interests me.\r\nYume: Ah, she changed the subject! That's fishy...\r\nMihono: Come to think of it... Konohana-san's been leading the way when it comes to solving the questions, hasn't she?\r\nMihono: That sort of doesn't seem like something she'd do...\r\nEllen: You're right... Now that you mention it, maybe Hanahana's acting strange... I think...\r\nSuzuka: That's because, with myself and Yume here, I decided this incident was affecting Yukari-sama!\r\nYume: Bringing up Yukari-sama now sounds even more fishy...\r\nSuzuka: ...It seems nothing I can say would help at this point. I'll only say this.\r\nSuzuka: I am not the traitor.\r\nYume: Hmph. You can say whatever you want... Cause beating you is gonna solve this faster.\r\nSuzuka: That's the trouble with you... You should think things through more before you act, Yume.\r\nEllen: You're being too aggressive! This is just a game, okay? There's no need to get violent!\r\nSuzuka/Yume: ......\r\nEllen: Come on, are you listening to me!?\r\n\r\nThroughout the story so far, there are hints to the traitor's identity.\r\n\r\nHint 1: Combine all the answers, and what do you get?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Escape!\r\n\r\nKaoru: Oi, Yume. Suzuka's not the traitor.\r\nKaoru: Isn't that right, Ellen.\r\nEllen: ...Huh? What are you talking about?\r\nYume: Ehh-? It's not Suzuka-onee-san?\r\nKaoru: You're the traitor, aren't you. Ellen.\r\nKiyoka: Umm... Isn't Ellen-san the one who can stop the traitor...?\r\nKiyoka: By \"listen to the white rabbit\", it means the person who all the answers pointed to so far, right?\r\nKaoru: See, look, the last question's the only one that's different.\r\nKaoru: There wasn't the usual letter from the white rabbit, and the letter on the question is \"R\" instead of \"Q\".\r\nKiyoka: Ah! You're right... Since we're still in the escape room game, this is another part of the riddle, isn't it!\r\nKaoru: That's how it goes. Which means... The white rabbit didn't write the last question. It's a fake.\r\nMihono: Huh? Then, who did write it?\r\nKaoru: The traitor, of course.\r\nKaoru: The question wasn't about finding who could stop the traitor, it was about discovering who the traitor is.\r\nSuzuka: ...I should have been able to see through such a simple trick, if only I were thinking more clearly.\r\nSuzuka: If the traitor is the one who wrote it... Then that makes whoever the questions indicated the most suspicious.\r\nSuzuka: Which means, she is a toji, a \"buddy\", owns one of the three okatana, her favorite cakes were in the room...\r\nSuzuka: It does all point to Kohagura-san.\r\nKaoru: It's not like you could help it when the fingers were pointing at you.\r\nYume: ...Uu, I'm sorry, Suzuka-onee-san.\r\nSuzuka: I can't blame you, in these circumstances.\r\nKaoru: So, how'd I do?\r\nEllen: Bingo bingo-! You're right on the money! The final question of the escape room game has been cleared!\r\nEllen: That's my Kaoru! You stole the show right at the end!\r\nKaoru: Nah, I knew halfway through that you were working with whoever's running this.\r\nEllen: Eh!? Since when!?\r\nKaoru: Even though you got dragged into an escape room game, you were acting way less excited than you should have been.\r\nKaoru: So, I thought that was suspicious... But I wasn't sure until we got to the cakes.\r\nKaoru: Under normal circumstances, you would've eaten them right away.\r\nEllen: I don't think I like how confident you are about that.\r\nKaoru: But I'm not wrong, right?\r\nKaoru: And you only offered to do a competition because you already knew the answer. Right?\r\nEllen: ...I really am no match for you, Kaoru.\r\nEllen: Now then... Here, the last key! Kaoru, please open the door.\r\n\r\nKaoru: I didn't think we could've been moved very far... But we're right here!\r\nChie: Great work, all of you!\r\nMihono: Ah, Mirja-san! You were helping run this too?\r\nMirja: Yes. Originally, I was meant to reach the third mistake early on and retire.\r\nMirja: However... We didn't imagine that, before I could do that, you would reach three mistakes, Asakura Mihono...\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono, you need to have a greater sense of caution before you act.\r\nMihono: A-Ahaha...\r\nKofuki: What, you were here too? Which means, you actually supplied the aradama?\r\nTsugumi: No, that was a random occurrence. We wouldn't leave out aradama for an escape room game.\r\nKaoru: So, what was this all for anyway?\r\nChie: Actually, some toji have been brainstorming ideas for attractions to liven up the area... This was a beta test for that.\r\nKaoru: Just so you know, you can hire testers for those.\r\nTsugumi: About that... Under normal circumstances, the hints were meant to be hidden in places where you can find them, but...\r\nTsugumi: For some reason, right before the test, aradama seem to have made off with them.\r\nChie: At that point... Ellen-san came up with a plan to get you all to help.\r\nKaoru: So it was your fault after all!\r\nEllen: But it was fun, wasn't it? We have to thank Yukari-sama for allowing Hanahana and Yumecchi to join in too!\r\nSuzuka: So you did get Yukari-sama's approval.\r\nYume: Well, it wasn't that bad of a way to spend some time.\r\nKiyoka: (Yukari-sama approved of this... She's actually pretty free spirited, isn't she?)\r\nMihono: Ah, the movie! Kiyoka, Fukki, if we leave now, we can still make it! Let's go!\r\nKofuki: Oh yeah, we were gonna do that.\r\nChie: Ah, hang on! Here, free vouchers for the cafeteria. It's your prize for clearing within the time limit.\r\nKiyoka: Thank you very much. If there's anything else we can do to help, let us know.\r\nChie: Of course, you're a big help.\r\nSuzuka: Now then, Yume and I must return to our duties as the elite guard.\r\nSuzuka: Please put on the best escape room game you can.\r\nYume: Seeya later! It was pretty fun.\r\nChie: Alright, the rest of us here are going to hold a strategy meeting on what to improve for the opening!\r\nKaoru: The rest of us here... Wait, I'm here!?\r\nEllen: No complaining; come help us, Kaoru!\r\nMirja: Let's re-examine the beta test so we can produce an entertaining escape room game.\r\nTsugumi: Ah, then, can we intentionally place aradama in there now? The types we can use are limited, but it's proven to work.\r\nEveryone: Out of the question!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/tSsi3HMt5qU\r\n[Fairytale Mihono: Start]: Off to Wonderland\r\n\r\nMihono: ......I don't get it at allll.

That's almost all of it.\r\nChie: Mihono-chan...\r\nMihono: Don't look at me like that, Chii-nee! I can't help it!\r\nMihono: Lately I've been doing aradama suppression missions, and expedition assignments, and I had to help with the escape room game too, remember? So I haven't had any time to study!\r\nChie: Even if you're sure that's all there is to it, you still make me worried...\r\nMihono: The one who's worried is me, cause I don't get any of this! At this rate, my summer vacation is in danger of makeup classes!\r\nChie: Okay, okay. That's why I'm here watching you study, isn't it?\r\nChie: Now then, first is this Japanese question. For this one...\r\nMihono: .........guh.\r\nChie: She fell asleep in the middle of the explanation!?\r\n\r\nChie: Wake up, Mihono-chan! We have to hurry to Wonderland!\r\nMihono: ...Chii-nee? Wonderland? We're done with the escape room game already...\r\nMihono: Eh, where is this?\r\nChie: Just how long do you plan on sleeping for, Mihono-chan?\r\nChie: We're going on a mission to suppress aradama in Wonderland, aren't we?\r\nMihono: An aradama suppression mission in Wonderland!?\r\nMihono: ...Are you tired, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: Okay, okay, whether you're feeling tired or anything else, just climb in that hole.\r\nMihono: That hole...?\r\nMihono: I have to go in here!? I can't even see the bottom!?\r\nChie: ...What's gotten into you today? If you don't go in that hole, you can't make it to Wonderland, can you?\r\nMihono: You're the one who's gotten into something, Chii-nee!\r\nMihono: If I fell down that hole, I'd die for sure!\r\nChie: Nobody's died going down there. You'll be fine.\r\nMihono: And who proved that!?\r\nChie: Honestly now, you can't go fussing over every little thing, you know? Now then...

You pushed me into that hole... and I fell... Wait? Was I dreaming?\r\nChie: Honestly now, not being able to tell a dream from reality, it's like you're having the butterfly's dream.\r\nMihono: The butterfly's dream?\r\nChie: It's a story about someone who dreamed that they became a butterfly, then couldn't tell if they were themselves now, or the butterfly dreaming they were themselves.\r\nMihono: ......It sounds like a confusing story.\r\nChie: What it means is, the Mihono-chan who's here studying now could just be a dream of the Mihono-chan who's falling forever into that hole.\r\nMihono: Huh, that's weird......\r\nMihono: Why'd you know I was falling forever into that hole, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: You're so funny, Mihono-chan. Of course I'd know about that. After all--\r\nChie: We're on our way to Wonderland to suppress the aradama, aren't we?\r\nMihono: ...Huh?\r\n\r\nMihono: BGYAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nChie: Fufu, isn't this wonderful, Mihono-chan?\r\nChie: If you don't want to study for your exams, you won't have to anymore. You can suppress aradama forever in Wonderland.\r\nMihono: I don't want to do that either!\r\nMihono: Anyway, how far down does this hole go!?\r\nChie: Until you think about what you've done wrong Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Then, I did! I did just now!\r\nChie: Did you really?\r\nMihono: I really thought hard about what I did wrong!\r\n\r\nMihono: I don't want to be in the butterfly's dream anymore, Chii-nee!\r\nChie: KYAAA!?\r\nMihono: Chii-nee!?

I did it, Chii-nee...!\r\nChie: Are you still half asleep?\r\nChie: Anyway, the butterfly's dream was the correct answer to the first problem. You said you didn't know, but you really did, didn't you?\r\nMihono: Th-That's not it! The Chii-nee inside my dream told me about the butterfly's dream...\r\nChie: Is that so, the me in your dreams taught you about it. Then, let's do the next problem.\r\nMihono: The me inside my dreams... Was that all it was? ......That really was just a dream, wasn't it?\r\nChie: What are you saying?

It was thanks to everyone's efforts that the escape room game was a huge success!\r\nTsugumi: I wasn't sure if things would go wrong during the beta test, but the final result went better than I expected.\r\nKaoru: The beta test went wrong as soon as you decided to do it like that. Do it normally like a normal person.\r\nMirja: You say that, Mashiko Kaoru, but there were things that could only be learned by doing it in that format.\r\nMirja: It was worthwhile in its own way. If we ever need to conduct it again, we will be counting on you.\r\nKaoru: Count me out! Find someone else to be your test subjects.\r\nChie: Thank you for your help today as well, Yanase-san.\r\nMai: It was nothing! I only helped on the day of, but after seeing how much the customers were enjoying themselves, I wish I had joined you sooner.\r\nChie: In that case, next time we come up with something, I'll be sure to contact you right away.\r\nChie: This time, we had short notice to come up with something to promote the area... It was honestly a lot of work.\r\nEllen: That's it! I just came up with something good! Let's all throw a party!\r\nKaoru: A tea party, since we did Alice in Wonderland?\r\nEllen: Yes! I want to make written invitations and everything. And if everyone brings tea and sweets, I'm sure it'll be a lot of fun!\r\nChie: That's a great idea.\r\nChie: We can plan another celebration party, and invite the girls who were too busy to join us now.\r\nEllen: Maybe we could invite Yukari-sama too?\r\nChie: I think she might be a little too difficult to get a hold of?\r\nEllen: Maybe you're right... That's too bad. I just found a place that makes the tastiest cakes too...\r\nKaoru: Huhh, a cake place you didn't already know about? Those still exist around here?\r\nEllen: No, I found it at a hotel I was staying in during an expedition.\r\nEllen: It was so good I couldn't believe it, so I went and got the chef's phone number!\r\nMai: Hotel cakes...\r\nMai: I was thinking I could bake some cookies, but... I suppose it would be better if we let your favorite chef handle things?\r\nEllen: What are you saying!? Everyone would love to eat your cookies, Maimai!\r\nEllen: In fact, I don't think it'll work if we can't get your cookies at the party!\r\nChie: In that case, Ellen-san will take care of the cakes, and Yanase-san will take care of the cookies.\r\nChie: We should all make some quick decisions on what we're bringing, so none of us bring the same thing.\r\n\r\nThe day of the tea party.\r\n\r\nMai: Ellen-chan's incredible... I didn't expect her to rent out such a luxurious party hall...\r\nEllen: It's not that big a deal, Maimai. I managed to fit it in our budget.\r\nSayaka: Kaoru, is that okay for the cups?\r\nKaoru: Yeah. Lay them out nicely and that should be good.\r\nKaoru: Anyway, can we get this started already-? I'm starving here-.\r\nMai: I think it would be best if we waited to cut into Ellen's cake after everyone arrives... But, if my cookies are enough to get you by.\r\nKaoru: That's plenty. They're as good as ever.\r\nSayaka: I like Mai's cookies.\r\nEllen: My cake is plenty good too!\r\nKaoru: It's not a competition. If it's a cake that you picked out, of course it'll be good.\r\nSayaka: Mai... Is it okay for me to be here? ...I didn't help with the escape room game.\r\nMai: Don't worry about that, Sayaka-chan. We gave you an invitation, didn't we?\r\nSayaka: ...Mm!\r\nKaoru: Oi oi, do we really have to work a time like this...?\r\nAradama: GGGIIII...\r\nMai: Why would there be aradama here!? Wait... It's running away!\r\nKaoru: Hey... Did it look like that aradama was holding something to you?\r\nSayaka: ...Ah. The cups we just set out... They disappeared.\r\nEllen: I don't believe it... The teapot is gone too! The aradama must have run off with it...\r\nSayaka: I worked hard to set them out...\r\nMai: We can get it back if we hurry, Sayaka-chan.

I'm growing a beak too.\r\nMai: Kaoru-chan, don't lie like that to Sayaka-chan!\r\nEllen: Though, I am feeling hungry too. We can start for now with a March Hare's tea party!\r\nMai: There are just the right amount of people, with the four of us.\r\nKaoru: Then, since Ellen came up with the idea, she can be the March Hare. I'll be the sleepy Dormouse.\r\nMai: I can be the Mad Hatter then, and Sayaka-chan, why don't you be Alice?\r\nSayaka: I can be Alice?\r\nMirja: Itomi Sayaka is going to be Alice?

I was looking forward to sampling Kohagura Ellen's cake. I we were late, I don't know what I'd do.\r\nSayaka: Tsugumi, will you sit here?\r\nTsugumi: If you're offering, how can I say no? Let's see... Should I just leave the sandwiches I brought on the table?\r\nEllen: Please do, Tsugumin.\r\nSayaka: ...You made them, Tsugumi? Kofuki told me, whatever you make is bad news.\r\nTsugumi: No need to worry. I understand how unpopular my cooking is, so I bought these pre-made and only added one sandwich of my own.\r\nKaoru: That's just Russian roulette!\r\nKaoru: ...Whoa whoa, I can't even tell these sandwiches apart.\r\nTsugumi: The pre-made sandwiches only have a special sauce applied to them, so there's no visible difference.\r\nKaoru: ...I'm not eating any of the sandwiches.\r\nMihono: Huh?

My family and everyone from my hometown were filled with pride.\r\nYomi: I never lacked in effort. I arrived earlier than anyone to practice, and left after all others had gone.

The strength for it.\r\nYomi: Still, I continued to practice with a sword. Believing that my dream would come true. But--\r\nYomi: I saw the backs of my classmates as they passed me again and again. Again, and again, and again...\r\nYomi: I was forced to accept the reality of my own powerlessness. However, I could not run back home.\r\nYomi: The faces of everyone congratulating me were burned in my mind--\r\nYomi: I couldn't stand the thought of disappointing them. It was frustrating. It was agonizing.\r\nYomi: At that time, President Takatsu approached me.\r\nYukina: If you want power, I can give it to you.\r\nYukina: You have nothing to worry about. Your talents make you suitable to receive this power.\r\nYomi: She said that I had talent. She gave me power. She was the only one, President Takatsu--\r\nYomi: The only one who acknowledged me.\r\nYomi: President Takatsu was the one who gave me hope. For President Takatsu, I would give anything.\r\nYomi: Even my life--\r\n\r\nYukina: ...Hmph, I was sure you had dropped dead by now, but you're stubborn if nothing else.\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYukina: You total failure of a guinea pig... Have you come to laugh at me now that I've lost everything?\r\nYomi: ......Pres...ident...\r\nYukina: HYAA!! Get away!! Don't come any closer!!\r\nYomi: .........I have... now... returned... President Takatsu.\r\nYukina: --!! ...Yomi... You...\r\nYukina: You came back for me...!? Not the princess, or Yukari-sama, but for me...!!\r\nYomi: ......\r\nAradama: GUUAAAAA!!\r\nYukina: ......!\r\nYomi: ...!\r\nYukina: Yomi, wait...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Delaying (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: Pant... Pant... The number of aradama... Just keeps getting bigger and bigger...\r\nChie: We should have expected it, since the gate to the netherworld is getting closer, but even this is more than I could have imagined...\r\nChie: At this pace, we won't make it to Yukari-sama and the others...!\r\nMirja: --! Imperial guard, straight ahead! Brace yourselves!\r\nChie: Kh... Here to slow us down again...!?\r\nKiyoka: Everyone! I'll stay behind and draw the guards away!\r\nKofuki: Oi oi, are you gonna be able to manage that? I thought you were scared of fighting other toji?\r\nKiyoka: I can't be like that in a situation like this! We all have to work together if we want to make sure Hono-chan gets there in time!\r\nKofuki: Heheh, trying to make up for being a \"waste of a toji\"...? Look at you acting all cool!\r\nKofuki: Oi, Mirja, Chichie. I'm staying with her. Look after Mihocchi for me.\r\nMirja: Musumi Kiyoka, Shichinosato Kofuki! You are both approved to temporarily act on your own!\r\nChie: Take care of yourselves, you two!\r\nImperial Guard A: Stop-! We won't let you go anywhere!\r\nKofuki: Shut the hell up! We're the ones dealing with you!\r\nKiyoka: You aren't going to get in Hono-chan's way!\r\nMihono: Fukki! Kiyoka! Thanks! I'll see you again soon!\r\nKiyoka: ...Kofuki-san. Thank you, for staying behind with me.\r\nKofuki: Forget about it! But as payback, that limited offer pudding you left in the fridge is mine!\r\nKiyoka: Ah... About that pudding, I forgot to write my name on it, so Hono-chan ate it...\r\nKofuki: WHA---!? Again-!? Why does she think anything without a name on it is okay for her to eat!?\r\nKofuki: ...Kiyoka, something important came up that I've gotta deal with. Let's wipe the floor with these guards already.\r\nKiyoka: ...Alright!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Delaying (2)\r\n\r\nKofuki: ...You know, for all that big talk back there, you're still hesitating against other toji. Your timing's off when you're getting serious.\r\nKiyoka: I-I'm sorry...\r\nKofuki: Well, since we won, it's all good! --C'mon, let's catch up to Ahocchi and them! [aho means dumb]\r\nKiyoka: Ah, you haven't forgotten about the pudding, have you. Fufu. You're cute when you get like that, Kofuki-san.\r\nKofuki: Shut up! Don't eat people's food if you don't want what's coming to you! That's the way the world works!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: Come Back to Me!! (1)\r\n\r\nKanami: Give Hiyori-chan back! Give her back...! Give her back...!!\r\nTagitsu: Oh...?\r\nYukari: Such incredible force of will...\r\nKanami: Give her back... Give her back... Give her back... Give her back...!!\r\nYukari: Is that the depth of her feelings for Juujou Hiyori...?\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan!! Come back to me!! UAAAAAA!!\r\nKanami: I'm... Right here!! Hiyori-chan!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: Come Back to Me!! (2)\r\n\r\nKanami: HYAAA!!\r\nTagitsu: Grgh...!\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan!!\r\nHiyori: ...That voice... Kanami...? Ahh, honestly...\r\nHiyori: No matter where I go...\r\nHiyori: Kanami!\r\nTagitsu: Oh... Urgh... --GAHH!!\r\nHiyori: HAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nKanami: --Hiyori-chan!?\r\nHiyori: Your voice really carries.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan...\r\nTagitsu: So the little chicks have grown into a pair of lovebirds. Certainly an auspicious moment--\r\nTagitsu: But it ends here!\r\nYukari: You won't have the chance!!\r\nKanami: -!? UWAAAAAH!? The floor's... Falling apart!!

We came here for you, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nSuzuka: Yomi-san, you're the third seat of the elite gaurd...\r\nMaki: Our irreplaceable friend.\r\nYomi: Your... friend...\r\nYume: The four of us are one; that's the elite guard! Right?\r\nSuzuka: That's right. After all, if one of us were to be missing, what would that make of us?\r\nYomi: .........But, I...\r\nMaki: Come back with us, Yomi.\r\nYomi: ............I will---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: Angels of the Battlefield\r\n\r\nYui: Nghh~...

I promised Mirja-san, I'd make it back alive no matter what. I don't want to make Mirja-san mad at me...\r\nYui: Waiiit? But having that cool beauty glaring down at me and yelling, that's like a reward on its own!\r\nYui: Huh? But I have to make it back alive so she can yell at me... Ah... But if I make it back alive, she won't be mad...?\r\nYui: Mm? What am I even saying anymore? Is the pain making me not make any sense?\r\nYui: Ahh~... Wowww, two angels are running over this way. You really do get to see stuff like this...\r\nToji A: This is the rescue team, one toji has been secured!\r\nToji B: No issues with her vitals!

People won't stop calling today... Tch, and it just had to be these assholes.\r\nAkira: Yeah?\r\n???: If you're entering the large scale aradama outbreak, you are to gather as much noro from it as possible.\r\nAkira: Huhh? Have you lost your damn mind? Try getting your priorities straight here!\r\n???: For that person's desire to be realized, a great amount of noro is needed.\r\n???: Inago Akira, you do understand, don't you?\r\nAkira: You sure love running your mouth, huh. You think naming them would make me do whatever you say?\r\n???: Everything is to fulfill that desire. It isn't as if I'm telling you to ignore the aradama, you know.\r\n???: Suppress the aradama, retrieve their noro, and... Keep an eye on the girl. You can do that, can't you?\r\nAkira: ...\r\nAkira: Yeah, sure, I got it! While I'm suppressing the aradama, I'll get you some noro!\r\nAkira: That good enough for you!?\r\n???: We have high expectations.\r\nAkira: FUCK!\r\nAkira: ...Sigh.\r\nAkira: Ahh, feels a little better letting it out like that! Damnit, this is starting to get on my nerves.\r\n\r\nToji A: Defend this position, no matter what!\r\nTojis: Right!\r\nMihono: There's this many aradama!?\r\nHana: It's like this everywhere inside. We keep killing them and killing them... And more aradama appear.\r\nHana: That's why we left our unit at a key location and went to secure an escape route.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nHana: Looking at it the other way, they can't move from there. So we have to force our way in.\r\nMihono: Okay!\r\n???: No! Stay away!\r\nMihono: Suzumoto-san, someone's calling for help!\r\nHana: ...That way, huh. Let's hurry, Asakura-san!\r\n\r\nMihono: There she is!\r\nHana: HAAAAAA!!\r\nWoman: ...\r\nMihono: Are you okay!?\r\nHana: Don't move her!\r\nHana: ...There's no injury on her head, and she doesn't seem badly hurt... Alright, she only lost consciousness is all.\r\nHana: It should be okay if we wake her up.\r\nMihono: H-Hang on a minute!\r\nHana: What is it?\r\nMihono: Ah, uh, it's just...\r\nMihono: (What if she starts acting the same as the people outside...)\r\nMihono: I think she was really scared of getting attacked by aradama... Wouldn't it be better if we let her stay asleep?\r\nHana: You have a point there.\r\nMihono: ...What's most important for us now is finding Yamashiro-san. I'll look to see if there's someone else around who can help her.\r\nHana: I'm counting on you.\r\n\r\nHana: I didn't expect that from you back there.\r\nMihono: Huh?\r\nHana: I was sure you'd offer to go and bring her outside yourself.\r\nMihono: Should I have?\r\nHana: No, it's good you didn't let your emotions get the better of you. You're right that we should focus on meeting up with Yui first.\r\nMihono: (Didn't let my emotions get the better of me? I did though...)\r\nMihono: Suzumoto-san!\r\nHana: Stay quiet... We can let this aradama go.\r\nMihono: Aren't we going to beat it?\r\nHana: Our number one priority is rescuing the people here. I know it sounds bad, but... Stopping the aradama comes second.\r\nHana: Good, it doesn't seem like it's noticed us.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nHana: Feeling frustrated?\r\nMihono: That's not it; there's just something on my mind... Um, can I ask you something?\r\nHana: What's that?\r\nMihono: Suzumoto-san, why did you choose to be transferred?\r\nHana: Why?\r\nMihono: My school's president asked me too; if I wanted to transfer.\r\nMihono: But back then, I told her no.\r\nHana: President Hashima must have high hopes for you, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: She does...?\r\nHana: Yeah. It's very hard working here, so they'd never recommend a toji without the strength to back it up.\r\nMihono: Ah...\r\nHana: Are you getting interested?\r\nHana: When I decided to transfer, I was thinking about the future. I wanted to build up a connection with the police.\r\nMihono: Suzumoto-san... You're so mature.\r\nHana: You think so?\r\n???: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: That voice was... Yamashiro-san!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5:\u3000At a Crossroads\r\n\r\nAradama: OOOOOOOOUUUUU!!\r\nYui: Whagh!\r\nYui: That's it for my utsushi... But, I'm not done yet!\r\nYui: HAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nYui: Pant... Pant...\r\nMan A: H-Hey, are you doing okay?\r\nYui: I'm fine, it's fine, this is a walk in the park!\r\nYui: ...ah, whoops.\r\nMan A: Look at you, you can barely stand up straight!\r\nYui: Ahaha, I think I'm just getting a little hungry.\r\nMan A: Why don't you rest for a while?\r\nYui: When Hana-san gets back, I'll take a break. Don't worry, she'll be back any minute now.\r\nMan A: Still...\r\nHana: Yui!\r\nMan A: It's that girl from before, and she brought help! Good, now you can get some rest.\r\nYui: Ooh! And she's a cutie too... Wait, that's Mihono-chan!\r\nHana: Mihono-chan? Yui, since when have you and Asakura-san been on a first name basis?\r\nYui: Never, but I'm in the camp that believes in calling cute girls by their first name!\r\nHana: I figured... Sorry about her, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: Ahaha, I'm totally okay with it! I'll call you Yui too then.\r\nYui: Thanks, Mihono-chan! I feel like I could fight for another five hours now.\r\nHana: Five hours? You're keeping it realistic, huh.\r\nMan B: What are you standing around gossiping for!? If you've got more toji, then start getting us out of here!\r\nMihono: -!\r\nMihono: (They're like this here too...)\r\nMan A: Don't talk to them like that! These girls are risking their lives fighting for us!\r\nWoman: You shouldn't pay him any mind. Thank you, for coming all this way... Really, truly, thank you...\r\nWoman: It was horrible... So many times, I thought it was all over...\r\nMihono: Ah...\r\nMihono: ...You don't have to worry! We'll keep you all safe, no matter what!\r\nYui: Then, let's get to it... whoops.\r\nHana: Don't overdo it, Yui. Asakura-san and I will keep guard, so you can take a quick break.\r\nYui: Ugh, sorry. I'll do that.\r\nHana: Oh, right.\r\nHana: Do you mind if I ask why you decided to transfer, Yui?\r\nYui: Where's this coming from? Could it be, you're just so interested in me you can't help it!?\r\nHana: Asakura-san asked me about it before. Now seemed like a good time, so I figured I'd ask you too.\r\nMihono: Thanks, Suzumoto-san.\r\nYui: Does that mean you're joining us, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Uhh, I'm considering it... After seeing things here, I started feeling sort of conflicted, I guess?\r\nYui: I see, so there's a chance, huh.\r\nYui: Hmm, okay. I guess I did it for the money? See, if you get loaned to the police, they start paying you a bit more.\r\nMihono: ...I kind of wasn't expecting that from you.\r\nYui: Fu fu fu, at Ayanokouji, they don't call me \"the girl you never see coming\" for nothing!\r\nHana: Did that help you any?\r\nMihono: Yeah. I can tell you and Yui both put a lot of thought into why you transferred.\r\nMihono: And I...\r\nMihono: (All I thought about was whether I'd stay with everyone. I should really... Think about it harder now.)\r\nMihono: What was that sound!?\r\nHana: It sounded like glass breaking, but... It's sort of unsettling not knowing what happened.\r\nMihono: I'll go check it out then! Suzumoto-san and Yui-san, you stay here!\r\n\r\n???: ORA!\r\nMihono: (Somebody's fighting?)\r\nMihono: (The broken glass... Is that a motorcycle? Did the motorcycle come crashing through?)\r\nMihono: (But why in here...?)\r\n???: C'mon, I don't have time for you small fry. Quit swarming me, damnit.\r\nMihono: (She's backup? She's wearing a Minoseki uniform, but... I've never seen her before.)\r\n???: Finally...\r\nMihono: (!? She's collecting the noro? Why is she doing that now, like she's hiding it...)\r\nMihono: That's enough!\r\n???: Huh?\r\nMihono: I'm Asakura Mihono, second year at Minoseki Academy's middle school division! What are you doing out here?\r\n???: ...Asakura Mihono.\r\n???: ('Course she'd be suspicious of a toji acting on their own in a place like this.)\r\n???: (Wasn't planning on making contact yet, but... Can't exactly explain what I was doing with the noro to her...)\r\nMihono: ...\r\n???: (Kashuu Kiyomitsu... It really is broken.)\r\n???: (Or, well...)\r\n???: You've gotta lot of nerve, don'tcha? Just gonna point your okatana at your senpai like that? Huhh?\r\nMihono: ...First, just answer me this. What are you doing here?\r\n???: First, gimme an apology for pulling your okatana on me. I'm your senpai, y'know?\r\nMihono: ...\r\n???: ...You asked for it.\r\n???: (For starters, I'll knock some sense into this bratty kouhai of mine! I can come up with something after!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Evaluation\r\n\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMihono: (This girl, she was collecting noro in secret...)\r\nMihono: (The head of the Origami family was doing the same thing, when she was possessed by Tagitsuhime...)\r\nMihono: (Whatever her reason, I'd better stop her!)\r\n???: It's not in me to waste breath arguing.\r\n???: Let's go.\r\nMihono: -!?\r\nMihono: (That was so fast... And she hits hard too!)\r\n???: HAAA!!\r\nMihono: Grh!\r\nMihono: (She's... Really strong!)\r\n???: (...She's got some muscle. But, eh, that's how it is.)\r\n???: ...Alright, I get the gist of it.\r\nMihono: Of what?\r\n???: (Can't go wasting much time here in these circumstances.)\r\n???: Just say goodnight for now!\r\nMihono: ...!!\r\nMihono: ...\r\n???: Man, what're they teaching in the middle school these days? Don't go turning your okatana on your senpai like that.\r\n???: ...Well, actually, I guess it was my fault this time.\r\nYui: Mihono-chan!\r\n???: Huh?\r\nYui: GET AWAY FROM MIHONO-CHAAAAAAN!\r\n???: Thought you'd get me by surprise!? Too bad; I'm used to that!!\r\nYui: Gh...\r\n???: What was with her?\r\nHana: ...What do you think you're doing, Inago-san?\r\nAkira: Me? She's the one who jumped me. Wait, do I know you?\r\nHana: Suzumoto Hana. I've seen you a few times through Mokusa.\r\nAkira: ...Ohh, you're with Mokusa too. That's perfect.\r\nAkira: I'm juggling what Mokusa and President Hashima want from me. Things've been getting annoying, so I was going it alone, and this one spotted me.\r\nHana: ...Is that how it went.\r\nHana: (President Hashima likely told her to do the same thing she told Mihono... So what did Mokusa want her to do?)\r\nHana: (Well, she probably wouldn't give me an answer even if I asked.)\r\nAkira: That's my story, so when they wake up, I'm counting on you to help explain.\r\nHana: Please try explaining things yourself before you get into a fight...\r\nAkira: Hey, they're the ones pointing their okatana at me?\r\nAkira: If someone tries putting me down, I'll make them regret it.\r\n\r\nHana: Anyway, that's Inago Akira-san.\r\nAkira: I'm Inago Akira. Good to meet you.\r\nAkira: Sorry about before; I just took you out on reflex.\r\nYui: No, don't worry about it! More importantly... Can I call you Boss!?\r\nAkira: Sure, call me whatever.\r\nYui: Will do!\r\nAkira: And, I didn't mean for things to get out of hand before, Mihono. I lost my cool and wasn't thinking straight.\r\nMihono: No, I shouldn't have taken out my okatana before I even asked you anything.\r\nMihono: Though, if President Hashima sent you, you should've said so sooner.\r\nAkira: My bad, but President Hashima didn't tell me anything more than to head over here.\r\nAkira: So, to make it up to you, let me help you guys out.\r\nAkira: I won't feel right if I don't pay you back.\r\nMihono: Sure, we'd be glad to have you, Inago-san!\r\nAkira: Akira's fine, Mihono.\r\nMihono: Okay! Akira-san!\r\nMihono: (Still... Why was she taking that noro? Was that part of President Hashima's orders too?)"}, {"paste_key": "in5mSLE2", "title": "There's an Anomaly in the Seasonal Rain Front!", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/in5mSLE2", "timestamp": "", "hits": "241", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko4ihFi6A2U\r\n\r\n1: A Picnic for Two!\r\n\r\nWeatherman: --The seasonal rain front has been hanging over Japan, but if it continues rising north like this...

They say the rainy season will clear up this weekend.\r\nKanami: Really!? It feels like it's been raining forever; that's great news.\r\nKanami: It's not like I don't like rain, but sometimes you just want to go outside and exercise, don't you?\r\nMai: Sure!\r\nMai: ...You know, it's been a while since we had a chance to talk with just the two of us, hasn't it?\r\nKanami: Now that you mention it...

Do you want to go on a trip with me? We could wake up early, and bring bento with us.\r\nKanami: It's a picnic!!

Then it would be kind of sad.)\r\n\r\n--The day before the picnic.\r\n\r\nMai: Let's get everything ready for the bento! Since we're having a picnic and all, I can get a little extravagant.\r\nMai: Karaage, ginger fried pork, hijiki kinpira. With this many brown colored foods, I should add a side dish of boiled spinach with soy sauce, tamagoyaki with tomatoes, and some Chinese style cucumber salad!\r\nMai: After that... Kanami-chan's favorite: natto over rice! ...I can't make that now though... Oh, right! I can just set the rice cooker for tomorrow morning... There!\r\nMai: Fufu~.

The rain front's a total V shape. It's like it got stuck on something there.\r\nKofuki: Is it cause of the air pressure or something?\r\nMai: ...Sigh.\r\nMai: (There's nothing I can do about it. The bento is already made, so I'll search for a place nearby with a good view, and we can go there instead!)\r\nMai: (It's a shame I won't be able to take Kanami-chan to that spot though...)\r\nKofuki: Hey, it's a mission!\r\nHiyori: They messaged me too. And...\r\nMai: ...Oh, that's right, me too.\r\nMai: Let's see, the members are... Myself, Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan, Shichinosato-san, and Yui-chan. The five of us will be going... Eh?\r\nMai: There!?\r\n\r\nMai: (I never thought we would be coming here like this...)\r\nKofuki: GOTCHAAAA!!\r\nYui: Nice going, Kofuki-san!\r\nKofuki: Ha ha ha! Keep the aradama-chan coming-!\r\nHiyori: Anyway... With the aradama appearing right where the rain front is sticking around, the rain sure isn't making this any better.\r\nYui: That's not true, Hiyori-chan! In fact, with it soaking shirts see through, I say bring on the rain!\r\nHiyori: ...You're always like this, aren't you.\r\nKanami: It's too bad, Mai-chan. We got pulled into this mission all of a sudden...\r\nMai: I know. But still, our duty as toji is important, so let's set our feelings aside and work our hardest.\r\nKanami: Right!\r\nMai: Though, I did make our bento, so I would at least like to share it today.\r\nKanami: I'm sure everyone would love to share your bento, Mai-chan!\r\nKanami: By the way, isn't this place--\r\nYui: Huh? Look over here, everyone! A teru teru bozu came out with the noro!\r\nKofuki: Teru teru bozu? Why was that in there?\r\nYui: I bet the aradama were wishing tomorrow would be bright and sunny too! ...Just kidding.\r\nHiyori: No, wait... Look at that!\r\nMai: It's brightening up? But, it was pouring rain just a minute ago...\r\nYui: Fufufu, it's all becoming clear now...\r\nYui: The reason this place is the only spot where the rain didn't go away is because the aradama stole the teru teru bozu!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Clearing Away the Rain and Eating Bento\r\n\r\nYui: Fufufu, it's all becoming clear now...\r\nYui: The reason this place is the only spot where the rain didn't go away is because the aradama stole the teru teru bozu!!\r\nKofuki: Get real.\r\nMai: (Defeating the aradama gets rid of the rain? Could that actually be the case?)\r\nMai: (I did see the rain stop with my own eyes though...)\r\nMai: I'm going to check the weather forecast site real quick.\r\nKanami: What's it say, Mai-chan?\r\nMai: I can hardly believe it, but... The weather front moved just a little bit north.\r\nYui: See! It's just like I was saying!\r\nYui: We have to get back the teru teru bozus, all filled up with everyone's wishes for sunny skies... That's our mission here!\r\nHiyori: But, still... What do you think, Mai?\r\nMai: ...Teru teru bozu have been a tradition since ancient times, so maybe there's some sort of cause and effect happening here...?\r\nHiyori: Is that how this works...?\r\nKanami: Ahaha, well, that might be what's happening, so we should try doing like Yui-chan says. People worked hard to make those teru teru bozu, so let's get them back.\r\nYui: Kanami-chan... I love you!\r\nKofuki: Get off of her. It's wet and gross enough as it is without you making things more muggy.\r\nYui: This isn't muggy at all! Actually, it's pretty cold after the rain...\r\nYui: I just made a sound unbecoming of a maiden! [her stomach growled]\r\nHiyori: Who are you calling a maiden.\r\nYui: No matter how you look at me, I'm a maiden, aren't I!? Anywayyy, my heart might be full, but my stomach right now...\r\nMai: I did bring a bento box with me... Would you like to have some?\r\nYui: I'd eat it even if it were poison!\r\nKanami: Then we should eat now, whil the rain's stopped!\r\nKanami: I'd hate to have the bento Mai-chan worked so hard to make get rained on.\r\n\r\nHiyori: Hmm, it's simple, yet carefully made. Let's see... Mm, this is good.\r\nKofuki: This karaage's seriously the best! This onigiri too...\r\nMai: Oh, that has...\r\nKofuki: Natto!? Who puts natto in onigiri; that's just weird.\r\nKofuki: ...Hey, but it's still good. There's plums, and sardine, and, what else did you mix in here?\r\nMai: I used natto and plums as the base. After that, I would make some slight changes to add variety.\r\nHiyori: I can tell you really challenged yourself with these onigiri, Mai. But, the sardines give it an interesting texture. It goes well together.\r\nYui: Mmhmm, that's Mai-chan for you. I'm glad to be on this earth if it means I get to eat onigiri this good~~~!!\r\nMai: ...What do you think of them, Kanami-chan?\r\nKanami: Of course I think they're extra delicious! The ginger fried pork and kinpira are really good too, but I love the natto onigiri the most!\r\nMai: ...I'm glad to hear it.\r\nMai: (I made that bento so you could eat it here, after all...)\r\nMai: (It might not be the picnic we planned on, but I think this might be fine in its own way.)\r\nKanami: Ah~, that totally hit the spot~. I wish I could eat your cooking every day, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: -!!\r\nKofuki: Oh, nothing helps a full stomach like some exercise! That's my aradama-chan, always looking out for me!\r\n\r\nKofuki: You're the last of 'em! I love you!\r\nHiyori: So, that aradama had a teru teru bozu too?\r\nMai: Wait? This is...\r\nKanami: Did you notice something about the teru teru bozu?\r\nMai: Could you let me see that, Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: Sure.\r\nMai: Thank you.\r\nMai: ...Mm, I'm sure of it. This is the teru teru bozu I made for today.\r\nHiyori: Why would something you made end up here...?\r\nMai: I thought it was in my room when I left, but... After that, maybe an aradama got it...?\r\nYui: Hang on, there's a bigger mystery here than that!\r\nMai: Yui-chan?\r\nYui: This smells... I can smell it...\r\nMai: ...Smell what?\r\nYui: The finely crafted bento, and the teru teru bozu hoping to stop the rain...\r\nHiyori: The weather forecast did say the rainy season would end today.\r\nYui: Exactly, which means, Mai-chan must have had plans to go on a date with someone today!\r\nKanami: Ohh-! That's amazing, Yui-chan! You almost figured it out!\r\nHiyori: (Wait, why did Kanami answer?)\r\nYui: Was it with Sayaka-chan!? Were you going on a date with Sayaka-chan!?\r\nKofuki: Get ahold of yourself. If she were going on a date with Sayaka, there would've been a bunch of cookies in the bento box, right?\r\nYui: ...Ah-! You're right!!\r\nMai: Umm, I do have cookies here...\r\nYui: I'll have some!\r\nKanami: Ah, can I have some too!\r\nHiyori: (Chew chew)... So anyway, who were you going on a date with?\r\nMai: I was...\r\nMai: (It's not something I need to keep a secret, but... For some reason, I don't want to say...)\r\nHiyori: I guess this is no time for us to be standing around talking.\r\nKofuki: Ah-! A real big one showed up! Time to help myself to dessert!\r\nMai: Let's go, everyone!\r\nKanami: Yeah!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Scenery We Once Saw\r\n\r\nAradama: oouuu...\r\nHiyori: Phew, we're just about done with them all.\r\nKofuki: What, that's it already?\r\nYui: I'm totally beat... Fighting in the rain is actually pretty tough...\r\nMai: Do you want to take a short break then? If we wait a moment, the rain should clear up too.\r\nHiyori: I don't see why not.\r\nKanami: Mai-chan.\r\nMai: What is it, Kanami-chan?\r\nKanami: Will you come take a walk with me?\r\n\r\nMai: (Kanami-chan... What could she want, asking that out of the blue?)\r\nKanami: Mai-chan, do you remember?\r\nMai: Eh?\r\nKanami: We've been here before.\r\nMai: ...You remembered that, Kanami-chan?\r\nKanami: How could I forget!\r\nKanami: The time we stopped here, back when we had just become toji, on our way back from a mission. This place is important to us.\r\nMai: Me too... I would never forget.\r\nMai: To tell the truth, I was thinking of coming here for our picnic.\r\nKanami: You were!?\r\nMai: That's why, it was kind of depressing. This was the only place the rain didn't clear up... And then we were called on to suppress aradama.\r\nKanami: Mai-chan...\r\nMai: Even so... Getting to talk with you like this now... I'm a little glad.\r\nMai: A lot happened, but... I think we got to make a more memories here than just a simple picnic, didn't we?\r\nKanami: Of course we did! I'll never forget about coming here today!\r\nHiyori: Kanami-! Mai-!\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan? What does she want?\r\nMai: Let's go find out, Kanami-chan!\r\n\r\nKanami: What is it, Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: Look up at the sky!\r\nKanami: The sky...? Ah!\r\nMai: A rainbow...\r\nYui: I never noticed this place was so beautiful.\r\nKofuki: That's a weirdly decent comment from you. Did Mai's bento fix you?\r\nYui: What if... It's purifying me from inside out!?\r\nHiyori: ...I'm sure if we had eaten Mai's bento while looking out on this, it would have tasted even better.\r\nKanami/Mai: ...Pfft. Ahaha!\r\nHiyori: What's with the two of you?\r\nKanami: Oh, it's nothing! I was thinking the same thing, Hiyori-chan!\r\nMai: In that case, how would you all feel about coming to a picnic here?\r\nMai: I'd want Sayaka-chan and the others to see this scenery too.\r\nKanami: That'd be great!\r\nKofuki: Bring the same onigiri with you again! I wanna see the shock on their faces when they bite into it.\r\nYui: And after their shock, they'll be hooked without a doubt!\r\nYui: Natto onigiri might become the next big thing, don't you think?\r\nHiyori: If we're going to do it, we should do it soon. Now that the rainy season is over, summer is right around the corner.\r\nYui: The season when girls start to shine is upon us!\r\nKofuki: You're always like this, aren't you.\r\nYui: This is just my identity!\r\nKanami: When we get back, let's start planning it together with everyone! It'll be a lot of fun, won't it, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: It sure will, Kanami-chan!"}, {"paste_key": "Hgdp0REx", "title": "bride yomi+misogi episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/Hgdp0REx", "timestamp": "", "hits": "84", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://streamable.com/wuht4\r\n[Bride Yomi: Start]: Undercover Investigation (Yomi's Case)\r\n\r\nYomi: There was another person who had their ring stolen by aradama?\r\nChapel Staff: Yes...\r\nYume: I get it...

I remember, I was in the laboratory...\r\nYume: Ah, you're awake, Yomi-onee-san.\r\nYomi: Yes... Good morning, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Now's not the time to be saying, \"Good morning\"!\r\nYume: I was getting worried that you weren't going to wake up, you know?\r\nYomi: You're right... It seems I wasn't thinking straight.\r\nYomi: I thought I was at Ban-san's lab, but now...\r\nYume: I was worried, so I had them bring you here. I'm not supposed to leave here since I'm on duty.\r\nYomi: ...Is that so. Thank you, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: You don't have to thank me.\r\nYume: Anyway, were the aradama at that researcher onee-san's place that strong? I thought she didn't have anything but weaklings.\r\nYomi: That's right. It was an ordinary aradama.\r\nYume: Why'd you get hurt then?\r\nYomi: That's because... It's somewhat of a long story. Do you want to hear it?\r\nYume: Yeah! Tell me all about it!\r\nYomi: It happened when I was in elementary school... I was involved in an aradama incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/jwnn0\r\n[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End]: To One Day Repay Her\r\n\r\nYomi: It happened when I was in elementary school... I was involved in an aradama incident.\r\nYume: Was it something like... The aradama back then was the same kind as the one at the lab?\r\nYomi: ...How did you know that?\r\nYume: Anybody could figure that out. There's nothing else it could be.\r\nYomi: ...I see. In that case, there's no need for me to explain the rest.\r\nYume: Ehh, I wanna hear more about what you were like when you were younger, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYume: What were you like back then?\r\nYomi: What was I like...? A normal elementary school student. I was a normal girl.\r\nYume: There's gotta be something more, right?\r\nYomi: ...There was nothing special about me. I was normal.\r\nYomi: Anyway, the incident involved a bull type aradama appearing on the main road... Several vehicles had been totaled.\r\nYomi: I was also nearly crushed by it.\r\nYume: That's like something out of a monster movie.\r\nYomi: Yes, I felt that I would die there. However... Moments later, a platoon of toji from Renpu arrived, and I was safely rescued.\r\nYume: Right in the nick of time! Do you know any of the girls who saved you?\r\nYomi: ...I only learned this later on, but the one directing that platoon was President Takatsu.\r\nYume: Really!?\r\nYomi: Yes. I want to repay her for that someday.\r\nYume: Repay her? Like how? By beating more aradama?\r\nYomi: ...Something like that.\r\nYomi: Since that incident, I had never faced another bull type aradama... But it seems my body still remembers the fear it felt then.\r\nYume: Hmmm. In that case, you should chop up that bull aradama.\r\nYomi: ...What?\r\nYume: You're only scared cause it beat you! So, won't you be fine after you kill one?\r\nYomi: ...Will I?\r\nYomi: No... You're right, if possible, I would like to overcome it one day...\r\nYume: Since you agree with me, let's go to the lab!\r\nYomi: ...Eh?\r\n\r\nYume: Onee-san, get a bull type aradama ready for us-!\r\nTsugumi: Tsubakuro-san, and... I see you're up and about again, Satsuki-san.\r\nYomi: I'm sorry to have made you worry.\r\nTsugumi: No no, it wasn't your fault.\r\nTsugumi: Anyway, a bull type aradama? I can have it ready in a moment, so are you ready to fight, Tsubakuro-san?\r\nYume: What do you mean? I'm not the one fighting it; Yomi-onee-san is.\r\nTsugumi: Satsuki-san... Will fight it?\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, if I see that aradama again, it's likely my body will freeze up once more.\r\nYume: I know that; the whole reason we're here is to help you beat that.\r\nYume: Don't worry about anything. If it looks like you're in trouble, I'll chop up that aradama for you.\r\nYume: Then you'll get used to it after a while, right?\r\nTsugumi: Well, in that case... I suppose there would be no danger.\r\nYomi: (I think my mental state will be in danger however...)\r\nYomi: ...I understand.\r\nYomi: It would cause problems if I were unable to act in the field, so please help me, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: You got it!\r\nYomi: Then... Ban-san, please begin. I'm going to accustom myself to fighting the bull type aradama.\r\n\r\nBull Type Aradama: ROAAAAAAAR!\r\nYomi: ...!\r\nYume: Way to go, Yomi-onee-san!

But, I just want to see how all kinds of different people fight.\r\nSawano: I'm alright with fighting you, but... As you know, I'm only the \"Lord of the Library\".\r\nKanami: Ahaha, sorry about when I called you that...\r\nKanami: But actually, after that, I heard you were a very reliable fighter, so I wanted to try facing off with you at least once!\r\nSawano: ...I understand. Show me the skills of someone who's spent more time in books than anyone.\r\nKanami: Yesss! Thank you very much!\r\nMai: Kanami-chan's spent more time in books than anyone...?\r\nKanami: I'll explain that later! Mai-chan, please be our referee!\r\nMai: O-Okay... Then, begin!\r\nKanami: ...\r\nSawano: (She isn't launching an attack...? In that case, I'll go to her!)\r\nSawano: HAA!\r\nKanami: ...\r\nSawano: (Eh!? She vanished!?)\r\nSawano: (Behind me!? In a split second!?)\r\nKanami: YAAAA-!\r\nSawano: Kh... HAAAAA!\r\n\r\n--That night, in Kanami's dreams.\r\n\r\nMinato: Hmm... So? How'd the match turn out?\r\nKanami: I ended up winning.\r\nMinato: Hey, that's great!\r\nKanami: ...\r\nMinato: What's wrong? You don't look too happy about it?\r\nKanami: No, I'm pretty happy I won. It's just, I wanted to keep fighting on and on...\r\nMinato: You're saying you didn't even get to hit your stride? Now you're getting cocky about it.\r\nKanami: It's not like that!\r\nKanami: I want to fight more and more, so I can be like you.\r\nMinato: You're starting all these matches to be more like me?\r\nKanami: That's because, you aren't there in the real world... If you were there, then I wouldn't have to.\r\nMinato: That sounds like it'd be a real waste. You're finally getting to fight people besides me.\r\nKanami: It'd be a waste?\r\nMinato: Each and every fight means you get more people to \"Look close! Listen well! Focus on your senses!\" with.\r\nKanami: And that's...\r\nMinato: If you keep that in mind, you could learn even more than you already are, okay?\r\nKanami: Look close, listen well, focus on your senses... Okay! Thanks, Master!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/kq33o\r\n[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End]: The Essentials of Swordsmanship\r\n\r\nMai: Eh? You want to have a serious match with me?\r\nKanami: Yeah! Please, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: You know I don't mind, but, where is this coming from?\r\nKanami: We always practice together, but I hardly know anything about you. So I was thinking, we could get to know each other better like this.\r\nMai: You want to know more about me...?\r\nKanami: Ehehe, sorry for asking you something so weird out of nowhere. When I woke up this morning, I just had this on my mind.\r\nMai: I don't quite understand, but... Alright. And if you're that eager about it, then I'm going to come at you with all I've got!\r\nKanami: Thanks, Mai-chan! Then, let's get started!\r\n\r\nMai: (Here she comes...!)\r\nKanami: (Stare...)\r\nMai: (Wait? Kanami-chan is acting differently than usual...?)\r\nMai: (But, if that's the case, I might be able to fight against her...!)\r\nKanami: (Ah, Mai-chan's stance changed. Woww, the way she's angling her sword is beautiful. It looks flexible at a glance, but I can tell she's holding it firm from her center.)\r\nKanami: (Oh, she closed the distance between us just a little bit! I get it... She's looking to see how I'll react. Then, if I move like this...)\r\nMai: (Kanami-chan lowered her body...! Is she preparing to charge? Then, I'll...)\r\nKanami: (Mai-chan took in a deep breath...! Maybe she's looking to set up a counter? But, in that stance, what would it look like...?)\r\nKanami: (Mmmm, I can't picture it at all... But... In that case, I just have to see for myself!)\r\nMai: (There it is! Kanami-chan moves so fast! But, I should be able to--)\r\nMai: YAAAA!\r\n\r\nMai: Aww, I lost... You're too tough for me after all, Kanami-chan...\r\nKanami: No way, you were great too, Mai-chan! When you came rushing out back there, I wasn't expecting it at all!\r\nKanami: That was Hokushin Itto-Ryu's \"Kiri-otoshi\", right?\r\nMai: Yep, you got it.\r\nKanami: I knew it! Please, Mai-chan! Show it to me again!\r\nMai: Fufu, I guess I don't have a choice.\r\nKanami: Awesome-!\r\nKanami: And, after that, I want to try using your move myself, so will you have another match with me too?\r\nKanami: Please! I'm begging you!\r\nMai: Then, on the other hand, I'll try moving like you did, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: You're the best, Mai-chan-!\r\nKanami: (Look close. Listen well. Focus on your senses.)\r\nKanami: (Just by keeping that in mind, swordfighting gets so much more interesting...!)\r\nKanami: (But, why did I suddenly think to try doing that? I feel like someone told me about it, but...)\r\nKanami: (Well, whoever they are, I've got to thank them someday!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSayaka\r\nhttps://streamable.com/8c30b\r\n[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start]: Lacking the Words\r\n\r\nToji A: What now... Yanase-san, Itomi-san! Many more aradama are coming this way...!\r\nMai: It might be frightening, but no matter how many there are, what we need to do hasn't changed.\r\nMai: Everyone finished evacuating, so let's hold our formation and take them out.\r\nSayaka: It's okay. I can... Deal with them.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan!?\r\nAradama: GGIII...!\r\nSayaka: --HAA!\r\nAradama: KSHAAA--!\r\nSayaka: Kh...\r\nSayaka: (I want to be strong enough to defeat them on my own.

You did defeat the aradama. Still, you might be strong, Sayaka-chan, but you're not supposed to fight on your own.\r\nMai: And you were even hurt a little.\r\nSayaka: I thought this would be the fastest...\r\nSayaka: You have to exorcise rampaging aradama as fast as you can.\r\nMai: Mmm... That's not what I mean though.\r\nSayaka: Then what...?

If what happened yesterday happens... I don't want that.)\r\nSayaka: (What should I do...)\r\n\r\nKaoru: Oh, there you are, Sayaka. So, what happened?\r\nSayaka: ...Kaoru, there's something I need your help with.\r\n\r\nKaoru: So you got told off by Mai during a mission yesterday, then you ran away, and now it's hard to talk to her like usual?\r\nSayaka: With things like this... I don't know what I'm supposed to do.\r\nKaoru: I know you want to make up with her. But, why did you do something reckless like fighting the aradama by yourself?\r\nSayaka: Because I want to be stronger. So nobody has to go through anything painful.\r\nKaoru: Well, Mai said she's worried about you too.\r\nSayaka: Mai did...?\r\nSayaka: She isn't... Mad at me?\r\nKaoru: I mean, of course she's mad when you put yourself in danger. But it's not like she's mad because she hates you now.\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nSayaka: Kaoru... I want to be with Mai like I used to.\r\nKaoru: If you think you did something wrong, then tell her you're sorry. After that, tell her how you feel. Then you'll make up.\r\nSayaka: Thank you.

I didn't listen to what you told me yesterday... And I made you worry today...\r\nMai: No, I should apologize too.\r\nMai: To tell the truth, Kaoru-chan told me about how she spoke with you. But still... I couldn't make up with you right away...\r\nSayaka: No, that was my fault.\r\nSayaka: I never had any friends before, so I didn't know how to make up after we fought.\r\nMai: But I also should have explained sooner why I was warning you yesterday. Then there wouldn't have been this misunderstanding.\r\nSayaka: Mai. I... I want to get even stronger. So, what happened yesterday... I might do it again.\r\nMai: In that case, we should get stronger together.\r\nSayaka: But, I want to get stronger so I can protect all of you. You're going to get stronger with me, Mai?\r\nMai: That's right.

Someone's getting married again today~. It's June Bride season, after all.\r\nYui: My mission's taken care of, so I think I'll make a quick little detour and check out the cute new bride in her dress-!\r\nAradama: Keeeeee...\r\nYui: Ehh, what's an aradama doing here!?\r\nAradama: Keeeee...\r\nYui: Wha-, it's headed for the wedding chapel! Stop-!\r\nYui: Getting married is the big moment every cute girl dreams of! I won't let you get anywhere near the ceremony! Take thiiis!\r\nAradama: Keeee...\r\nYui: Phew, I managed to stop it~. The noro's taken care of, so I'll just head on over to see the bride... Huh?\r\nYui: Someone dropped a ring... And there's a huge diamond in it too. It must be expensive. This has gotta be an engagement ring. But, that's weird. It wasn't here before.\r\nYui: Ah-, what if it came out of the aradama I just exorcised...\r\nPolice: You there, don't move, this is the police!\r\nYui: The police!? Wh-What are you grabbing my arm for!? Let go of me, please-!\r\nChapel Staff: Yes, officer, that's the girl! She's been here every day lately, acting suspicious outside the building, and, whenever the staff make eye contact with her, she runs off!\r\nYui: S-Suspicious!?\r\nPolice: Do you mind coming with us down to the station? There's some things we'd like to ask you as a potential suspect.\r\nYui: E-Ehhhh~!? Why me!? You've got the wrong girl~!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Something awful happened! It's Yui-chan, she...\r\nTsugumi: What's the matter, Musumi-san? You're all out of breath. What did Yamashiro-san do now?\r\nKiyoka: I heard that, Yui-chan got taken away by the police.\r\nEllen: Oh my god! So Yuiyui finally got arrested, huh~. Did they catch her peeping, or what~?\r\nKiyoka: This is serious! You've heard about it too, right? How rings keep getting stolen from the wedding chapel.\r\nTsugumi: I saw them talking about it on the morning news. It's the chapel right by the school, isn't it?\r\nKiyoka: Apparently the police suspected her of being the culprit behind the thefts, and that's why they took her away~.\r\nEllen: Unbelievable! Yuiyui would never be a thief!\r\nTsugumi: That's right. If she were arrested for stalking that would be one thing, but I find it hard to believe she would steal rings.\r\nKiyoka: I know Yui-chan would never do something like that! So, will you all help me out? We can prove Yui-chan didn't do it together.\r\nEllen: Of course I will! But, what we could possibly do to prove Yuiyui's innocence... Hmmm.\r\nKiyoka: We can track down the stolen rings! That should prove Yui-chan wasn't the one who stole them, right?\r\nTsugumi: That makes sense. The thefts seem to occur every day, so if we lie in wait at the scene of the crime, we can catch the true culprit and recover the stolen rings.\r\nEllen: There's no time like the present! If we want to prove Yuiyui's innocence, we should head to the wedding chapel right away!\r\n\r\nEllen: This is it, the wedding chapel where the rings are getting stolen.\r\nTsugumi: I received permission from the staff. We should split up to look for whether the rings could have fallen and gotten lost somewhere, and whether any suspicious individuals arrive.\r\nMihono: Roger! I'll go look out in the courtyard.\r\nKanami: I'll go check out the bride's waiting room!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Hmmm, it doesn't seem like any rings have gotten lost around here.\r\nEllen: There isn't anyone suspicious around either.\r\nAradama: KEEEEEEEE!\r\nKiyoka: KYAAA----!! Why is there an aradama here!?\r\nTsugumi: Please calm down, Musumi-san. This is a perfect opportunity to test the qualities of this new aradama which has appeared in the wedding chapel. Leave it to me.\r\nTsugumi: TAAAAAAA!\r\nAradama: KEEEEEEE...\r\nTsugumi: Hm? Something came out from inside the defeated aradama.\r\nKiyoka: Ehhh!? Isn't that... That's a wedding ring!?\r\nEllen: Since it popped out when you exorcised that aradama... That means, the culprit behind the stolen rings were aradama all along!?\r\nKiyoka: Aradama were stealing the rings!? I've never heard of anything like that though. Tsugumi-san, do you know about this?\r\nTsugumi: This is the first case I've seen, so I'm just as surprised as you are. But, since we all witnessed it, there can be no doubt. Yamashiro-san must be innocent.\r\nKiyoka: Thank goodness~. Still, I won't forgive them for stealing those rings from the brides!\r\nEllen: That's the spirit. For the brides, and to prove Yuiyui's innocence, we need to suppress every last aradama here!\r\nKiyoka: Right! Let's all work together to stop those ring stealing aradama!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Elite Guard Joins In!\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Come along, Maki-san, we have another mission to get to!\r\nMaki: You sure are eager today, Suzuka. I want to do all I can to clear the suspicions against Yamashiro Yui too.\r\nSuzuka: Th-That's right! I'll give my utmost efforts to carry out this assignment, as I always do!\r\nYume: Like always~? But, ever since you heard about this mission at a wedding chapel, you've had a sorta smile on your face, Suzuka-onee-san.\r\nSuzuka: That's because... It's not as if I'm delighted to go with Maki-san to a wedding chapel, you know...\r\nYume: Ahhh~, you said it all yourself! Still, I'm jealous. It must be fun, since there's supposed to be a lot of pretty brides around in June, right?\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, Shidou-san and Konohana-san are not going there to enjoy themselves.\r\nYume: I know that-. They're going to catch whoever's stealing rings from the brides, right? But, why do the elite guards have to catch a thief anyway?\r\nYomi: Because the one responsible for the stolen rings is an aradama.\r\nYume: Ehh~, there's an aradama ring thief!?\r\nMaki: Strictly speaking, it's still an unconfirmed report. Yamashiro Yui, who was present at the scene, gave her testimony that the ring came out of an aradama the moment it was exorcised.\r\nSuzuka: It didn't seem as if she was lying... Though, as there were no other witnesses at the time, Yamashiro-san was placed under arrest.\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san and I are going to the wedding chapel, on behalf of a request from the police, in order to determine the truth of the situation. Now, Maki-san, are you ready to go?\r\nMaki: Hm? Yukari-sama is calling me. Yes, this is Shidou... Understood. I'll be there right away.\r\nSuzuka: What did she say?\r\nMaki: It's an urgent summons from Yukari-sama. Sorry, Yomi, but you'll have to go with Suzuka to the wedding chapel in my place.\r\nYume: Suzuka-onee-san, cheer up!\r\nSuzuka: I do not need cheering up! Come now, Yomi-san, let's head to the scene.\r\n\r\nEllen: It's Hanahana and Yomiyomi! What brings you here?\r\nSuzuka: Oh my, I see you're all here. We received a request for assistance from the police and came at once.\r\nYomi: Our mission here is to determine whether the one stealing the rings is an aradama or Yamashiro-san.\r\nKiyoka: In that case, please look at this! It's proof that Yui-chan wasn't the culprit.\r\nSuzuka: This is, one of the stolen rings? Where on earth did you find it?\r\nTsugumi: After exorcising an aradama, this came out. All of us here observed it with our own eyes, so I can vouch that it's reliable information.\r\nEllen: Hanahana, Yomiyomi, you have to take our testimony to the police and set Yuiyui free!\r\nSuzuka: I truly wish I could do that, however...\r\nYomi: Unfortunately, the police will not be convinced by eyewitness reports from friends of the suspect. That's what we were dispatched here for.\r\nEllen: Then, that means, unless an aradama shows up right in front of you, you won't set Yuiyui free!?\r\nKiyoka: Please~. We don't know when another aradama could be here... And if you two aren't there to see it, who knows what will happen to Yui-chan?\r\nSuzuka: We will be monitoring the area to the best of our abilities. Sadly, we have no way of knowing when an aradama may appear...\r\nKiyoka: Isn't there any other way we can help Yui-chan? I just know she's not the kind of girl who would ever steal a ring!\r\nTsugumi: She may be the kind of girl who would steal a classmate's gym uniform... But never something so valuable.\r\nEllen: That's right. She has been caught trying to secretly photograph everyone while they were changing, but Yuiyui would never steal a ring!\r\nKiyoka/Tsugumi/Ellen: She's completely innocent!\r\nSuzuka: From your passionate assertions, I'm well aware that Yamashiro-san is a dangerous person, but not the type who would purposefully steal a ring.\r\nYomi: However, it is impossible for us to declare Yamashiro-san innocent unless we catch the culprit in the act.\r\nAradama: KEEEEEEE!\r\nKiyoka: Ahhh-!? It's here! The aradama is here!!\r\nEllen: It's pretty rare to feel this glad to see an aradama.\r\nTsugumi: Konohana-san, Satsuki-san, we will show you all the evidence you need now. Please watch closely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: A Touching Reunion!?\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Konohana-san! Satsuki-san! You saw what happened now, didn't you? When the wedding ring came shooting out of the aradama!\r\nSuzuka: Yes, I certainly witnessed it.\r\nTsugumi: Aradama that collect wedding rings. Having seen it a second time, the data becomes all that more credible. As soon as I get back to the lab with this, I can...\r\nKiyoka: Tsugumi-san, please wait! We have to help Yui-chan first.\r\nTsugumi: I'm sorry, I almost forgot our main objective... Though, with this many eyewitnesses, this should be irrefutable evidence.\r\nEllen: We should go right to the police station, so we can ask them to free Yuiyui!\r\nSuzuka: We will also be sure to explain the details of the situation to the police representative who asked for the Origami family's involvement.\r\nSuzuka: Go on, leave the rest of the work to us and go pay Yamashiro-san a visit.\r\nKiyoka/Tsugumi/Ellen: Okay!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan! We all came here to prove your innocence!\r\nEllen: It must have been so hard for you, Yuiyui, in this unfamiliar place... You look so worn down... Or not?\r\nTsugumi: That's true. Is it me, or does the complexion of her skin look healthy, and she even seems to be more excited than usual...\r\nYui: Thank you for coming all the way here to see me!\r\nYui: I was actually hoping we could have a tearful reunion through a plexiglass window, and maybe share a kiss through it, but they just let you meet suspects face to face in here. It kinda spoils the mood, huh~.\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan... Somehow, it seems like you're doing just fine.\r\nTsugumi: More than fine, is it my imagination, or is she enjoying being here?\r\nEllen: Ah-! Don't tell me, they put you through such horrible torture that your mind went crazy?\r\nYui: Ahaha, it's nothing like that~. Sure, when I was caught by the police, I was thinking, \"What do I do!? My life's over~!\"\r\nYui: But then in the police car, this cute police lady was snuggled up right next to me. Then I got to go into a private room and talk to this sexy detective lady all alone; it was actually a lot more fun than I was expecting.\r\nTsugumi: A reaction that defies all expectations... That's Yamashiro-san for you.\r\nKiyoka: I can't believe you-! I was so worried, to the point I couldn't even eat, you know?\r\nYui: You were that worried about me... I'm really feeling loved here~.\r\nEllen: Actually, Kiyoka might be a little haggard, but you're looking kind of healthy yourself, Yuiyui...\r\nYui: Ahaha, you think so too, Ellen-san? Well, when I was in the interview room, they gave me a whole lot of katsudon, so I might've put on a little weight~.\r\nTsugumi: You really are enjoying your time here to the fullest, weren't you...\r\nKiyoka: I was worried sick about you-! You're terrible, Yui-chan! I don't care what happens to you anymore!\r\nYui: Wait, wait! Don't go, Kiyoka-chan! I mean, they gave me as many katsudons as I asked for, okay? Anyone would eat as much as they can if you give them a free all you can eat buffet, right?\r\nTsugumi: Yamashiro-san, I don't think you're aware of this, but the katsudon you ate in the interview room wasn't the detective treating you to a meal.\r\nYui: Eh-!? She wasn't!?\r\nEllen: I've heard that, when you're released, they give you a bill for for everything all at once.\r\nYui: No way... Why wouldn't they tell me something like that from the beginning-!?\r\nYui: If they won't give me all the katsudon I can eat, then I've got no reason to be sitting around here! Please help me leave this place~!\r\nTsugumi: I'm not so sure anymore, if the only reason you want to leave is because you won't get free katsudon...\r\nYui: Come on, of course I have more reasons than that. If somebody doesn't stop those ring stealing aradama, then there'll be no end to the brides getting their hearts broken. I've gotta do what I can to help!\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan... That's right, we have to get you out of here and do all we can to suppress the aradama!\r\nEllen: Hanahana and Yomiyomi from the elite guard are working to prove the culprit behind this is an aradama. We just have to be a little patient.\r\nYui: Ehh-!? Konohana-san and Yomi-san are going out of their way for me!?\r\nYui: What should I do~. I think my heart skipped a beat! I found yet another reason to be happy I got arrested!\r\nKiyoka: Sigh... Nothing can keep Yui-chan down, can it...\r\nTsugumi: She's a real testament to humanity's ability to thrive under any circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Suzuka and Yomi's Acquittal Plan\r\n\r\nYomi: They said they couldn't release Yamashiro-san... I wonder why that is?\r\nSuzuka: Do the police mean to say they cannot trust our word?\r\nYume: Suzuka-onee-san, calm down. There's a reaaally~ good reason for this. Right, Maki-onee-san!\r\nMaki: Yeah, that's right. If I had to say either way, they have pretty solid reasoning for not letting Yamashiro Yui go yet.\r\nSuzuka: Why is it you two seem to be struggling not to laugh?\r\nYomi: I can't imagine what Shidou-san and Tsubakuro-san are getting at...\r\nSuzuka: I'm as lost as you are. You went to visit the police when we were on our mission, didn't you? What could have happened there?\r\nMaki: Sorry about that. I should know better than to let my emotions show when working.\r\nMaki: The police accepted your report that the culprit was an aradama.\r\nYomi: In that case, why would they postpone her release?\r\nYume: That onee-san, they said she might've done a whole lot of other bad things, so they can't let her go.\r\nSuzuka: Other bad things? Does that mean that Yamashiro-san has committed other crimes?\r\nMaki: No, they can't decide if any of them were crimes, but there seems to be plenty of things that fall in a grey area.\r\nMaki: The police interviewed her friends, and found cases suchs as her relentlessly following after female students that caught her interest...\r\nMaki: Or hanging around the girls' locker room with a camera...\r\nSuzuka: Those are all things it sounds like Yamashiro-san would do...\r\nMaki: If nothing's too suspicious, they plan on trusting what you and the other toji said and letting her go, but...\r\nSuzuka: I'm starting to understand. Just how significant one's usual habits can be for them.\r\nYomi: I feel the same...\r\nSuzuka: Though be that as it may, if Yamashiro-san is kept in the police station much longer, it would be troublesome for our work as toji, wouldn't it?\r\nYomi: Yes. If she hasn't broken any laws, it would be reasonable to release her and have toji be on their guard around her.\r\nMaki: I agree with what you're saying. But, there's another problem.\r\nMaki: From the sound of things, the police already had their eye on her, after she'd been frequently visiting the wedding chapel.\r\nYume: They said they caught her ooover and over again on the security cameras, peeking around the chapel with a weird grin on her face.\r\nSuzuka: That sounds like something Yamashiro-san would do as well... However, knowing her, she was surely only wanting to get a look at the beautiful brides, wasn't she?\r\nYomi: Frequently visiting the chapel to see women dressed up for the occasion... Anyone familiar with Yamashiro-san would quickly accept that explanation.\r\nMaki: If only someone at the police station knew about her, this could all go smoothly...\r\nSuzuka: ...Sigh. It seems this can't be settled so simply.\r\nYume: Onee-sans, you're just overthinking this. All we've gotta do is get rid of every aradama that stole rings, then give all the rings back, and then they'll let her go, right?\r\nSuzuka: I see, that would work as well. If that's what it comes to, we should eliminate all the aradama who have appeared at the wedding chapel, and recover their rings as quickly as we can.\r\nMaki: Unfortunately, Yume and I have already been tasked with another assignment. I'm leaving this to you, Suzuka, Yomi.\r\nSuzuka/Yomi: Of course.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Well now, all of you are here as well?\r\nTsugumi: The wedding chapel's staff agreed to let us stay here so we could ambush the aradama when they appear.\r\nEllen: After all, the best way to prove Yuiyui's innocence is to suppress the aradama and get back all the rings.\r\nSuzuka: We came to the same conclusion. We'll give you our support.\r\nAradama: KEEEEEEE!\r\nEllen: Wow! One's here already.\r\nSuzuka: Everyone, let's give it our best efforts!\r\nKiyoka: Right! I'll do my best, so Yui can get released!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Finally Free!\r\n\r\nYui: Ahh~! The air on the outside really does taste better~.\r\nKiyoka: Honestly! We went through a lot of troublew proving your innocence, Yui-chan. You'd better thank everyone from the elite guard too.\r\nYui: Sure I will! Whether it's my heart or my body, I'll give them anything they want from me.\r\nSuzuka: There's no need for you to feel that grateful.\r\nYomi: Yes, I have to respectfully decline as well.\r\nYui: Come onnn~!\r\nEllen: And on that note, everything's taken care of! Or, I wish it were that easy, but...\r\nTsugumi: We have a bit of bad news for you all. News has just come in that there are still some rings which haven't been recovered from the aradama.\r\nYui: Ehh-!? That wasn't all of them!?\r\nKiyoka: We finished our biggest goal by getting Yui released, but thinking about the poor brides, there's no way we can stop here.\r\nSuzuka: We've come this far together, so the two of us will continue to offer our assistance.\r\nYui: Great! In that case, let's all head back to the wedding chapel!\r\n\r\nYui: Wait? There's no brides in the reception hall today, are there?\r\nKiyoka: Word got out about the aradama always showing up here, so people kept cancelling their plans. If we don't deal with the aradama quick, the wedding chapel will go out of business...\r\nYui: Gehh-! We can't let that happen! We have to take out every last aradama, so this oasis of my heart can stay afloat!\r\nEllen: Kanamin went and talked to the people at the chapel for us, so we can lie in wait for the aradama in the reception hall!\r\nSuzuka: Understood. ...What's this? One of the programs for a wedding reception was left on the floor.\r\nEllen: Program? What's that?\r\nTsugumi: It's a sort of schedule for events like wedding ceremonies or receptions that list how things are meant to progress and the performances.\r\nKiyoka: \"Cutting the cake, the first bite, slideshow down memory lane, something to entertain all our friends, letters to our parents...\" It all sounds like a lot of fun!\r\nEllen: Japanese wedding ceremonies sound like they go all out!\r\nKiyoka: It's exciting just reading the program. I can't help but picture the wonderful wedding ceremony I might have someday!\r\nYui: You're such a pure little maiden after all, Kiyoka-chan. When I get rich, I'll make your dreams come true and give you the grandest wedding you can imagine!\r\nTsugumi: And Yamashiro-san seems to have fully assumed the position of the groom...\r\nYui:\u3000Ah-, but I'm not just talking about Kiyoka-chan. I want you all to be there as brides, so we can have a reception with everyone in wedding dresses!\r\nEllen: Wow! A wedding reception packed to the brim with toji! Sounds like fun! I bet it'd be exciting to use our okatana to cut the cake, huh~.\r\nSuzuka: Cutting the cake with an okatana. Maki-san, doing it in a pure white tuxedo, would be simply divine... Ahh...\r\nEllen: Hm? What's wrong, Hanahana? Your face started turning red?\r\nSuzuka: I-It's nothing at all!\r\nKiyoka: You know, I'd like to see Shidou-san cutting the cake too! And with Konohana-san standing next to her in a dress, I'm sure it would make for a beautiful photo!\r\nSuzuka: D-Did you overhear that? Musumi-san... You have it all wrong, I-I was only...\r\nYui: Mmm~, Suzuka-san is just the best when she's blushing too~. This is why I can't get enough of working together with the elite guard!\r\nYomi: ...\r\nYui: What do you want to do at the wedding reception, Satsuki-san?\r\nYomi: Nothing comes to mind... I'm not very good with social events.\r\nYui: Don't say that, here, just look at the program! Doesn't seeing such a fun filled event put you in a good mood?\r\nYomi: (Stare)... I'm sorry, I don't see any events that stand out to me... Hm? Yamashiro-san, what is this \"rice shower\" about...\r\nYui: To celebrate the wedding, everyone pours rice over the bride like a shower. It's so pretty, like fresh snow coming down~.\r\nYomi: They pour rice at a wedding ceremony? Why would they do that...\r\nTsugumi: Rice symbolizes prosperity and bearing many descendants, so it came to be seen as being showered with good fortune.\r\nYomi: I see. It's true that, from one grain you can produce hundreds or thousands more, so rice is the most suitable symbol to use with wishing for prosperity and fertility.\r\nYomi: On top of that, there is a legend that seven gods reside within a single grain of rice. They are strongly believed to be the Seven Gods of Fortune, so it could be said that rice is a necessity at any celebration...\r\nEllen: Y-Yomiyomi!?\r\nYomi: And also, along with gold, silver, and jewels, the treasure ship the Seven Gods of Fortune ride on carries bags of rice to represent an abundant harvest. Stacks of rice are considered a good luck charm that bring peace to a family and financial success...\r\nKiyoka: I didn't think Satsuki-san could talk this much...\r\nAradama: KEEEEEEE!\r\nYomi: Ah-, aradama. Everyone, this isn't the time for needless conversation. Let's carry out our mission at once.\r\nTsugumi: Needless conversation... You were the one doing most of the talking though, Satsuki-san.\r\nSuzuka: We could all do shift our focus as quickly as Yomi... Let's follow by example and join her!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: A Surprise Thank You and Apology\r\n\r\nYui: Alrighty-! Now all the stolen rings have really for real been found again!\r\nYomi: Mission accomplished. With that, we will withdraw. Good work, the rest of you.\r\nEllen: We should probably get going too. Kanamin and them were really into the idea of throwing Yuiyui a welcome back party.\r\nChapel Manager: Please, wait!\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan, that's the person in charge of this whole wedding chapel... I wonder why he came running out here in such a hurry.\r\nChapel Manager: Thank you so much for getting all those rings back. And also, I'm terribly sorry for being so suspicious of you!\r\nYui: Mr. Manager, you don't have to bow your head. It was my fault too, for sneaking into the wedding chapel all those times. You shouldn't blame yourself.\r\nChapel Manager: Even if you say that... Please, let me do something to make it up to you.\r\nYui: It's okay, you don't need to make it up to me. All I needed was to bring the smiles back to the faces of those teary eyed brides.\r\nTsugumi: It was also a part of our work as toji, so there really is no need to worry about us.\r\nChapel Manager: Still, after all the trouble I caused you, if I don't do something to apologize, I won't be able to feel this is settled! Please, is there any way I can repay you!\r\nSuzuka: If you insist so much, we could hardly outright refuse you. Yamashiro-san, can you not think of any requests?\r\nYui: Ah-! I thought of something good. Mr. Manager, let me borrow your ear for a second.\r\nYui: (Whisper whisper)... Would something like that work?\r\nChapel Manager: It would be my pleasure! I will have enough ready for everyone as soon as I can.\r\nYui: Hooray-!\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan, what did you ask for?\r\nYui: Mfufu, you'll just have to wait and see~.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Look at all these stunningly beautiful wedding dresses...\r\nKiyoka: I don't believe it-! This dress is the latest design from a famous designer! Yui-chan, what's it doing here?\r\nYui: The manager prepared all these after I said I wanted everyone to wear a wedding dress. Go ahead and pick out the dresses you like the most!\r\nEllen: They're all so gorgeous; I can't make up my mind!\r\nSuzuka: Yes, they're all exquisite, aren't they. If only Maki-san had come along...\r\nYomi: I will now be returning to the Origami estate, so I can send Shidou-san here in my place.\r\nYui: You can't go now, Yomi-san! We made sure to get enough for each of you, so please, you have to wear one!\r\nSuzuka: Yamashiro-san has the right idea. If they offer their gratitude, it is our duty to accept it. There's no need to concern yourself with Maki-san; I'll be sure to involve her with the next amusing distraction we find.\r\nYomi: If you say it's our duty... I have no choice but to accept.\r\nChapel Manager: Regrettably, the dressing room is filled at the moment, so I must ask you to please change here in the chapel. As this is the top floor, I can assure you that no one will see inside.\r\nEveryone: Okaaay!\r\nKiyoka: I'm going with this dress! Ahh, it's just fantastic. If I'd known a chance like this would come along, I would have gone on a diet~.\r\nEllen: I think you're plenty cute as you are, Kiyoka. I'll be wearing this dress here!\r\nTsugumi: I'd like a long sleeved dress with little skin exposed, if possible... Hm? Speaking of which, I haven't seen Yamashiro-san for some time now.\r\nKiyoka: I can still feel her eyes watching though... Ah-, over there! That suspicious figure on the rooftop across the way!\r\nTsugumi: Even from this far, I can recognize that silhouette. That would be Yamashiro-san, with a telescopic camera readied.\r\nSuzuka: A telescopic camera!?  Was she planning to secretly photograph us from long range!?\r\nEllen: This is an emergency, everyone! Please stop changing for no...\r\nKiyoka: Hang on a minute! It looks like Yui-chan is being apprehended by security officers...\r\nEllen: Right after we helped her get out, she's getting arrested again!?\r\nTsugumi: Unbelievable... There's just no keeping up with Yamashiro-san, is there.\r\n\r\nYui: E-EHHHH~!? Wait, please let go of me-! Agh-, I almost had it too~!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Bride Kiyoka: Start]: Undercover Investigation (Kiyoka's Case)\r\n\r\nYui: Ehhh!? Aradama showed up at the wedding chapel again!?\r\nKiyoka: Mm, it sounds like it.\r\nKiyoka: Apparently another ring was stolen, so maybe it's the same aradama from before?\r\nYui: Stealing a ring from a bride-to-be at the happiest moment of her life; Yamashiro Yui, ally to women around the world, won't let this stand!\r\nKiyoka: ...Though sometimes, you're their enemy.\r\nYui: Ahaha, there you go again with your jokes~.\r\nKiyoka: A ha ha ha.\r\nYui: Kiyoka-chan, your smile's looking a little forced, isn't it-?\r\n\r\nKiyoka/Yui: An undercover investigation?\r\nChapel Staff: That's right. If one of you acts as a decoy, we can find where the aradama hid the ring, right?\r\nYui: ...Did you know about this? [whispered]\r\nKiyoka: No, they only said we'd learn the details when we arrived... [whispered]\r\nChapel Staff: Um...?\r\nYui: Ah, it's nothing! That'll be just fine with us! Please, just let us handle everything!\r\nChapel Staff: We'll be counting on you then. So... Which of you will wear the wedding dress?\r\nKiyoka/Yui: ......\r\nKiyoka: (I want to wear a wedding dress! But, Yui-chan...)\r\nYui: Hm? What could be on your mind, Kiyoka-chan? Here, don't be shy, let's get you into that dress!\r\nKiyoka: But...\r\nYui: Huh, do you not want to wear it? You like wedding dresses, don't you, Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKiyoka: I-I do.\r\nYui: I'm just teasing you. I know what you're thinking. You're worried I'm going to do something weird, right?\r\nKiyoka: You realized!?\r\nYui: Of course, it's me we're talking about.\r\nKiyoka: Then... You won't come in while I'm changing?\r\nYui: I- won't- come- in-?\r\nKiyoka: Why did that sound so phony!?\r\nYui: Sorry, sorry, I'm just kidding, Kiyoka-chan. I would never force my way in on you while you're changing.\r\nYui: We're in a wedding chapel after all, so I'll swear to God to keep my word.\r\nKiyoka: Still...\r\nChapel Staff: Excuse me, you can lock the waiting room door, so...\r\nKiyoka: Okay! I'll dress up as the decoy!\r\nYui: That's how little you trust me!?\r\n\r\nYui: Fu, fufufu... As if I'd try. Peeping on you while you were changing was never what I was after, Kiyoka-chan...\r\nYui: It's my chance to see you in a wedding dress, so I have to make sure you get changed first! Excuse me, Mr. Staffmember! Could I please borrow a camera!\r\nChapel Staff: A... Camera?\r\nYui: That's right! I need a camera, to record the aradama from a distance!\r\nChapel Staff: Oh, of course! I'll get you one right away!\r\nYui: Now everything's ready to go...! All that's left is... To wait for Kiyoka-chan!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Bride Kiyoka: End]: Shutter Chance!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan really never came...\r\nKiyoka: There wasn't any sign of her trying to unlock the door, so she wasn't lying.\r\nKiyoka: Sigh, I should have trusted her more... I was rude to Yui-chan, wasn't I...\r\n\r\nYui: Oh, welcome back, Kiyoka-chan! You look so good in that wedding dress! We should get married right away! Marry me right now!\r\nKiyoka: Thank you... Hey, why do you have that camera!? You didn't have it before, did you!?\r\nYui: That's the expression I'm looking for!\r\nKiyoka: Answer the question!\r\nYui: Why...? The staff here lent it to me.\r\nKiyoka: Why would they do that!?\r\nYui: All I had to do was say I wanted to record pictures of the aradama, and they handed it right over.\r\nKiyoka: Of course they would, if you put it like that...\r\nYui: Pretty quick thinking on my part, huh?\r\nKiyoka: It's devious...\r\nKiyoka: KYAA-!?\r\nYui: Got that expression too! It's so good-, you're so cute, Chan-kiyo!\r\nKiyoka: Chan-kiyo...\r\nYui: But, no matter what, a girl's smile is always best! Go on, smile for me!\r\nYui: And if you'd try flaunting your chest while you're at it, I'd be even happier!\r\nKiyoka: Well I'm sorry you can't see my chest unless I flaunt it, okay!?\r\nYui: All breasts, big and small, are beautiful, Kiyoka-chan!\r\nKiyoka: That's not making me feel any better-!\r\nYui: Hmmm, I thought you'd be acting more embarrassed... Whoopsie.\r\nKiyoka: Stop trying to embarrass me so you can take pictures...\r\nYui: I'm just screwing around, you know. Since you do get to wear a wedding dress and all, wouldn't you want some pictures taken?\r\nKiyoka: You seemed totally serious to me... But, still... This wedding dress is very cute...\r\nYui: Isn't it? So just leave it to me, your cameraman.\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan... Why are you down there on the floor?\r\nYui: Well I have to take some low angle shots of you, don't I? Don't worry, I'll be sure your panties don't show up in the pictures!\r\nKiyoka: Panties...!?\r\nKiyoka: Did you just take a picture of them!?\r\nYui: Relax, the only record of your panties is safe in my memories.\r\nKiyoka: I don't want that either----!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Bride Suzuka: Start]: Undercover Investigation (Suzuka's Case)\r\n\r\nMaki: An undercover investigation?\r\nSuzuka: Yes, we will be going undercover.\r\nSuzuka: Another report has come in from that wedding chapel of an aradama stealing a wedding ring.\r\nMaki: Which means, someone will have to dress like a bride to lure the aradama out?\r\nMaki: Should we defeat the aradama there though? Shouldn't we work to get the stolen ring back?\r\nSuzuka: No, we have a ring equipped with a transmitter, so we only need the aradama to steal it.\r\nMaki: I see, that makes sense.\r\nMaki: So you'll be the bride, the aradama will steal the ring, we track where it goes, and this will all be solved.\r\nSuzuka: Eh!?\r\nMaki: Did I get something wrong?\r\nSuzuka: N-No... Only, I'll be the bride? The members from the previous mission have all been gathered...\r\nMaki: Of course, if there's a chance you'll be in danger, I'll be right there to protect you. But wouldn't it be best if we were the ones doing the dangerous work?\r\nSuzuka: Y-You do have a point.\r\nMaki: And besides, instead of someone like me, you'd make a much more convincing bride, Suzuka.\r\nSuzuka: V-Very well then. I'll play the bride to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: There, I've put it on. Hopefully it can convince the aradama I'm a true bride...\r\nSuzuka: (Nonetheless... The design of this wedding dress is exquisite.)\r\nSuzuka: ...Does it suit me, I wonder?\r\nSuzuka: Even though I should be accustomed to wearing dresses... It's strange. I'm feeling slightly nervous.\r\nSuzuka: ...Fu.\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san? ...I've finished changing.\r\nSuzuka: ...Maki-san?\r\nChapel Staff: Oh, if you're looking for Shidou-san, she said she would patrol the chapel while you get changed.\r\nSuzuka: How typical of her.\r\nSuzuka: It would be a waste to wait for her return, so I'll go on patrol as well.\r\nChapel Staff: Of course, please do.\r\nSuzuka: ...May I ask you something?\r\nChapel Staff: What's that?\r\nSuzuka: ...This doesn't look strange on me, does it?\r\nChapel Staff: No, it's a perfect fit.\r\nSuzuka: Thank you very much... Don't tell anyone I asked that, will you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Bride Suzuka: End]: You're Late, You know?\r\n\r\nSuzuka: I said I would search for Maki-san, but it's difficult to cover such a large area.\r\nSuzuka: Oh? Over there, that's... Yomi-san, Ban-san. So you two were stationed here.\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nTsugumi: Satsuki-san, shouldn't you say something more? On average, brides enjoy compliments.\r\nYomi: You look very nice, Konohana-san.\r\nSuzuka: Well, I do appreciate the flattery.\r\nSuzuka: But more importantly, have either of you seen Maki-san around?\r\nTsugumi: Shidou-san? I haven't seen her.\r\nYomi: I spoke with her a little about our patrols.\r\nSuzuka: How long ago was that?\r\nYomi: Only a few minutes ago. She went to look for where security was light.\r\nSuzuka: Light security... Thank you, Yomi-san.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: If she went to where there was little security, this should be a likely area...\r\nKiyoka: Oh, Konohana-sa... Wow, that's so pretty.\r\nEllen: Hanahana, you look amazing in that wedding dress!\r\nEllen: I wish I could wear one too!\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, thank you. Have you seen Maki-san around?\r\nEllen: Makimaki was right here with us until a moment ago. I think she's still nearby!\r\nKiyoka: Ah! You want Shidou-san to see you in your wedding dress, don't you!\r\nSuzuka: All I want is to perform our mission, which I need to find her for.\r\nSuzuka: ...Musumi-san? We mustn't confuse our private interests with our duties.\r\nKiyoka: I-I'm sorry.\r\nSuzuka: Please focus your attention on securing the area, will you?\r\n\r\nSuzuka: ...Really now, it's all because Musumi-san had to say something strange that I'm somewhat nervous again... Ah.\r\nMaki: ......\r\nSuzuka: ...! M-Maki-san?\r\nMaki: Oh, Suzuka. Looks like you're done getting changed.\r\nSuzuka: Y-Yes.\r\nMaki: There's been no sign of anything here. The spectrum finder hasn't responded either, so it doesn't seem like the aradama is around.\r\nSuzuka: ...\r\nMaki: Suzuka?\r\nSuzuka: Ah, it's nothing... Its target must be the ring after all.\r\nMaki: That's right, we should get it ready now.\r\nSuzuka: Yes.\r\nSuzuka: (Honestly, why did I expect anything more from Maki-san... I feel like a fool for ever getting nervous.)\r\nMaki: Suzuka?\r\nSuzuka: I'll have the ring ready in a moment. The other toji have taken their positions, so we can start...\r\nMaki: No, I didn't mean that... You look good.\r\nSuzuka: Ah... Fufu, I'm glad to hear that, Maki-san.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Bride Yomi: Start]: Undercover Investigation (Yomi's Case)\r\n\r\nYomi: There was another person who had their ring stolen by aradama?\r\nChapel Staff: Yes...\r\nYume: I get it... That means we've got a thief to catch, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYomi: Yes, and the culprit is an aradama.\r\nYume: Sounds like it! So let's start searching! We'll do an undercover search!\r\nYomi: ...An undercover search?\r\nYume: Yeah! I'll wear a wedding dress and lure it out, so you just have to watch me, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYomi: ...Is there a dress available for us to use?\r\nChapel Staff: Ah, yes, of course. I'll have one for you right away.\r\nYume: A wedding dress~! I can't wait~!\r\nYomi: So this is the reason you proposed an undercover search.\r\nYomi: Very well. Then, please leave the aradama to me.\r\nYume: Why!?\r\nYomi: It's possible the aradama may not appear if you are holding an okatana.\r\nYomi: The decoy should focus entirely on luring out the aradama. The guard will take care of the rest.\r\nYume: I don't want to wear a wedding dress then! You wear it, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYomi: Weren't you looking forward to wearing it?\r\nYume: I was, but... If I don't fight, then I can't show off my good side.\r\nYomi: ...Understood.\r\nYomi: We will switch off acting as the decoy, so I will have a wedding dress prepared for me as well.\r\nYume: Hey hey? Is it okay if I take a picture of you wearing your dress, Yomi-onee-san?\r\nYomi: ...What would you need that for?\r\nYume: To remember the occasion! We might not get to do this again, so I want to show everyone!\r\nYomi: ...Eh? Everyone...?\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san and Yukari-sama!\r\nYomi: Th-That would be...\r\nYume: No backing out-! We're doing it for sure-! Ahaha, I can't wait-!\r\nYomi: For... sure?\r\nYume: Yeah!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Bride Yomi: End]: Please Don't Look\r\n\r\nYume: Is she ready yet-, is Yomi-onee-san ready yet-?\r\nYomi: ...Sorry for taking so long.\r\nYume: Ah, I've been waiting forever, Yomi-on--\r\nYume: ...Wow! You look super pretty, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYomi: D-Do you think so? It doesn't feel right on me...\r\nYume: No way! You're like a real bride!\r\nYomi: ...Th-Thank you very much. Hopefully the aradama thinks I am a real bride too...\r\nYume: What do you want to do until the aradama shows up? Should we walk around?\r\nYomi: First, we should wait here.\r\nYomi: If it doesn't come... Then we can walk around a little.\r\nYume: Hey hey, while we wait for the aradama, I can take some pictures, right?\r\nYomi: ...Please don't point your phone at me.\r\nYume: There's no way I'm passing up something this fun. Give me a smile!\r\nYomi: ...\r\nYume: C'mon-! You have to smile!\r\nYomi: I thought I was smiling...\r\nYume: You're not smiling at all. Like, say cheese!\r\nYomi: Ch-Cheese?\r\nYume: Hmm, you still aren't smiling right.\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOO!!\r\nYomi: Ah!? Tsubakuro-san! The aradama!\r\nYume: Oh, you're right. HAAAA!!\r\nYume: Huh, that was nothing.\r\nYomi: ...Tsubakuro-san, you weren't supposed to defeat it. Now we can't identify where the stolen ring was taken.\r\nYume: The heck, that sounds annoying.\r\nYomi: We have no choice but to wait for another aradama to appear.\r\n\r\nYukari: You did well on your assignment. ...Yomi?\r\nYomi: Yes?\r\nYukari: That wedding dress suited you.\r\nYomi: H-How did you... Tsubakuro-san!?\r\nYume: Ah, yep. I showed it around to everyone.\r\nYomi: B-By everyone, you mean...\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san, and Suzuka-onee-san~.\r\nYomi: I should have firmly refused..."}, {"paste_key": "v31vpVXe", "title": "Eternal Vacation", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/v31vpVXe", "timestamp": "", "hits": "85", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/0vVIGDtRVLE?t=1320\r\n\r\n1: Eternal Vacation - Prologue \r\n\r\nMihono: Yaaay-! The sea! It's the sea~!!\r\nKaoru: I seriously never thought I'd be sent to a beach resort instead of on another expedition...\r\nEllen: It's too bad Hanahana and Yomiyomi couldn't come along, but I'm impressed with the manager's generosity; inviting all the toji who helped with the aradama at the wedding chapel to come here.\r\nKaoru: Ahh, this feels great... Ah-! Hang on a sec, what if that's a flag...\r\nChie: Ufufu, you're such a pessimist, Kaoru-san. There's nothing to worry about. We aren't here for a mission; this is a true and honest vacation.\r\nMirja: As an apology for suspecting Yamashiro Yui, and out of gratitude at suppressing the aradama and returning the wedding rings, the manager made it very clear that would be the case.\r\nKaoru: Yeah, that's true. Then, let's get this vacation started... Or I'd like to, but we ought to thank Yui first for all this. Where is she anyway?\r\nChie: As soon as we arrived, Yui-chan went chasing off after some bride, so she could be anywhere.\r\nEllen: They call this place a sacred spot for resort weddings, after all~. There's a lot of brides around!\r\nMirja: I see Yamashiro Yui still hasn't learned her lesson. Though, I suppose it was thanks to that side of her that we were rewarded like this...\r\nKaoru: Hang on? Where did everyone else go?\r\nChie: They went to the resort's wedding hall, to see a wedding photo of Juujou-san's mother there.\r\nKaoru: A resort wedding, huh? That's a pretty flashy thing to do for Hiyoyon's mama.\r\nMirja: No, to be more precise, it doesn't sound as if she actually held her wedding ceremony at the resort.\r\nEllen: But then why would there be a photo of her here?\r\nMirja: I'm not sure of the details. Did you hear anything about it, Setouchi Chie?\r\nChie: I don't know much myself, but the story of when that photo was taken is supposed to be what led to this resort becoming a popular wedding spot. It's amazing, isn't it?\r\nEllen: I'd love to hear the full story-! I'm going to go check it out. Want to come with me, Kaoru?\r\nKaoru: No thanks. Even if we aren't on duty, it's the fate of us wage slaves that anything could come up at any time. Gotta enjoy yourself while you can...\r\nKaoru: Ugh... Right on schedule. And there's no way they're calling about good news.\r\nMirja: Yes, this is Kitora... I see... Yes, we will move out at once.\r\nChie: Is it aradama?\r\nMirja: Yes, within the area of this resort, it seems there is an infestation of aradama. There is a great number of them too. Unfortunately, our vacation will have to be temporarily suspended. Let's gather everyone together.\r\nKaoru: ...\r\n\r\nMihono: Did aradama really show up?\r\nKanami: We have to be ready to go on the double!\r\nMirja: Before we do that, just as a precaution, will everyone please take out their airline tickets. It would be a serious issue if one were to get lost, so we should collect them and leave them in the valuables locker at the hotel.\r\nKiyoka: Good idea, Mirja-san! It would be awful if anyone lost theirs.\r\nMihono: Huhh-? No way! I lost my plane ticket!\r\nKanami: You're so clumsy, Mihono-chan, losing something that important... Wait, hold on! Mine's gone too-!\r\nKaoru: Ugh, mine too...\r\nMirja: You should all put more consideration into managing yourselves. I have my ticket secured right here...\r\nKofuki: Oi, Mirja! Isn't that case for your glasses? Why'd you put it in there?\r\nMirja: Because it's a valuable item I cannot afford to lose... Oh, it seems my ticket is gone as well.\r\nChie: If everyone's tickets all vanished at once, I can't imagine it was any ordinary thief that did it, can you?\r\nYui: What if it's aradama taking things again?\r\nMirja: That's highly plausible. As we are now, none of us will be able to return home. Let's defeat the aradama and recover our airline tickets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Eternal Vacation - Epilogue\r\n\r\nMihono: We suppressed all the aradama and got everyone's airplane tickets back, so now we're free to have our vacation!\r\nMirja: Why... We should have defeated every one of the aradama, and yet, my airline ticket is the only one still missing...\r\nChie: Eh? You weren't able to find yours, Mirja-san? Everyone else's were there though...\r\nKiyoka: Ehh-, then that means, Mirja-san won't be able to come back home?\r\nMirja: This is a problem. All of the aradama should have been suppressed... Sigh, just what should I do...\r\nMihono: Oh yeah! I just thought of something. There was a flyer outside the wedding hall that said they were looking for helpers before.\r\nKanami: If we all pitch in, we might be able to make enough for a ticket back home!\r\nEllen: Good idea! Let's go check it out now!\r\nMirja: I can't apologize enough. You should be having your vacation, and yet you're helping me...\r\nMai: Don't feel bad about it. It wasn't your fault your ticket got lost, after all.\r\nSayaka: Mm. I'll work hard with everyone.\r\nHiyori: That wedding hall owes us for what my mom did for them too. I'm sure they'll let us work without any hassle. Let's go see.\r\nEveryone: Yeah!\r\nKaoru: I finally get to come to a resort, and now I have to work...\r\nEllen: No point in complaining about it. Come on, let's go!\r\nKaoru: Sigh... Goodbye, blue skies, goodbye, blue sea...\r\nMirja: Everyone, please wait. This is a rare opportunity, so you should enjoy your vacation as we planned.\r\nKaoru: Are you fine with that...?\r\nMirja: I can stay behind and work here long enough to purchase an airline ticket on my own.\r\nMirja: You have a responsibility to make the best of your time here, recovering your strength so you can be ready for the next battle. Please, go on, and don't worry about me.\r\nKiyoka: But, you must have been looking forward to this too, Mirja-san... Looking forward to having fun with everyone... It's a little heartbreaking.\r\nMihono: Yeah, I know. Saying something like that, trying not to make us feel bad, you're being too nice. I can't take it...\r\nYui: Mmhmm, and, on top of that, you have that nice hot body. These slender legs that go all the way up... Stare...\r\nKiyoka: Hey, Yui-chan! Why are you looking up Mirja-san's skirt!?\r\nMirja: Ya-Yamashiro Yui!? You're molesting me at a time like this!?\r\nYui: I'm not molesting anybody~! Look what I found, Mirja-san! Here, on the inside of your skirt.\r\nMirja: The inside of my skirt...? Ah---!!!!\r\nMihono: No way-! The stolen airline ticket was sewn underneath her skirt all along!!\r\nMirja: I of all people should have remembered...\r\nKofuki: Nn? What's going on? Didn't the aradama-chan take it?\r\nMirja: Everyone, I am incredibly sorry for the trouble I have caused. I completely forgot that I had decided to sew my ticket onto the underside of my skirt, thinking it wouldn't be lost that way.\r\nMihono: Ehh-!? But, didn't you say yesterday that you put it in your glasses case so it wouldn't get lost?\r\nMirja: Yes. I did put it there yesterday, but, for security reasons, I routinely changed its location.\r\nMirja: From under the insole of my shoe, to inside my glasses case. After that, I transferred it to several other places...\r\nMirja: And I had entirely forgotten I had moved it to the inside of my skirt.\r\nKaoru: Even for a false alarm that's going a little far, don't you think.\r\nKanami: It's fine, Kaoru-chan. I'm just glad we found it.\r\nTsugumi: That's for sure. Still, short of x-ray vision, how did you realize it was there in the first place, Yamashiro-san?\r\nYui: Welll, I just had a feeling her skirt wasn't swaying around the way it usually does~.\r\nMirja: I see that perversion of yours has proved itself useful yet again. Regardless, thank you very much for your help here.\r\nKaoru: Cool, we found the airplane ticket just fine, so before anything screws this up, let's get right to our vacation.\r\nEllen: I'm all for it! Let's change into our swimsuits straight away!\r\nMirja: Change into our swimsuits... That would cause trouble for me. I'll have to move the airline ticket to a more secure location first...\r\nKaoru: Give it a rest already-!"}, {"paste_key": "ciNkSwZQ", "title": "Let's All BBQ in the Great Outdoors!", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/ciNkSwZQ", "timestamp": "", "hits": "88", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jpu5TIzQvho\r\n\r\n1: The BBQ Boss Is Here to Help\r\n\r\nMihono: We're at the campsiiite~! Barbecue, barbecue~!\r\nMihono: Look at all the people around. Well, it is summer break. Something smells really tasty too!\r\nEllen: You're just raring to go today, aren't you, Mihomiho.\r\nMihono: Heh heh heh-. That's cause I've been waiting so long for this barbecue! I used up all my money getting the best meat I could buy, so you better start working up an appetite now, okay-?\r\nChie: Mihono-chan... Will you be alright with no spending money?\r\nMihono: Since I live at the dorms, I just have to hang on a little bit till payday comes, and it'll all be fine!\r\nKiyoka: You get really fired up about these things sometimes, don't you Hono-chan. We should follow her example.\r\nMirja: The best meat... My heart is full of anticipation, but it could be dangerous for us all to behave exactly as Asakura Mihono.\r\nUraga Nao: Mirja told me all about you all; you really do seem like a fun bunch~. I think I lucked out tagging along for a refresher here~.\r\nMirja: Uraga Nao, we need you to manage the barbecue for us, so go right ahead and show off your talents.\r\nNao: When you put it like that, you'll give them the wrong kind of expectations~. I'm not a barbecue master or anything, okay?\r\nMirja: That's not true. You're our powerful backup here.\r\nKiyoka: When the investigation team tries to do the cooking... Somebody slips in their own special ingredients, and it turns into a mystery hot pot... Or the curry ends up getting burnt.\r\nChie: If everyone would just do as I tell them... Everything would turn out fine, you know...?\r\nEllen: But so long as you don't go overboard, barbecuing is just as simple as cooking it.\r\nNao: You're right, there are lots of things you can easily barbecue, but to get the tastiest results, you can't stop working the spatula, you see~?\r\nMihono: Uraga-san, are you like a hot pot boss but for the barbecue? [Someone who gets very bossy when cooking at a hot pot.]\r\nMirja: She is. However, she's a hot pot boss as well, so she's both boss of the hot pot and barbecue.\r\nNao: Hey, you keep giving them the wrong idea~. I'm not the boss of anything~. Just someone who wants to cook stuff as delicious as it can be.\r\nMihono: With a barbecue boss here, my meat's going to be the best it can be... Ehehe.\r\nNao: ...Looks like it's no use trying to stop this misunderstanding now, is it~...\r\nEllen: Are we going to start getting the barbecue set up already? Or, since we're here, should we play around by the water first?\r\nMirja: That's an idea as well. Though I would like to consider the most efficient timing of heating up the barbecue.\r\nKiyoka: What do we do... Hono-chan, I just realized something important...\r\nMihono: What's that?\r\nKiyoka: Everyone here today... Besides us... They're all so big.\r\nKiyoka: I heard that development is linked to what you eat... It might be a good idea to try eating exactly like how they do...!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, this is our chance to get bigger!\r\nMihono: Bigger? Like how? Anyway, the meat! We have to get the meat ready! You should eat some meat too, Kiyoka!\r\nMihono: Ahh, I can't wait to see that meat start sizzling-.\r\nKiyoka: (Hono-chan... Meat is the only thing on her mind right now...)\r\nNao: It's nice and warm out, so an afternoon nap might be nice too~.\r\nEllen: Now that would be refreshing. If Kaoru could hear you, she'd be jealous, fufu.\r\nKiyoka: (Mmmm, \"A sleeping child is a growing child\"... What if that saying is true?)\r\nScream: UWAAAA...!? A-ARADAMAAA!\r\nMihono: ! Guys, let's go!\r\n\r\nNao: Are you hurt~? Is anyone injured?\r\nBarbecue Goer: It's nothing serious... But, the food for the barbecue...\r\nNao: The food?\r\nBarbecue Goer: I don't know why, but... They took most of the food.\r\nMirja: We saw this strange pattern before, with the chocolate stealing aradama. That behavior may have spread.\r\nChie: It's a good thing nobody was hurt, at least.\r\nMihono: They're never getting away with stealing food from the barbecue! Let's beat them all and get it back!\r\nMihono: Ah, but first, I have to make sure my meat doesn't get stolen too!\r\nKiyoka: Right, it's important we stay careful.\r\nMihono: Wha...\r\nEllen: What? What's wrong?\r\nMihono: ...It's gone! My meat!! My meat's not here!!\r\nMihono: IT'S GOOOONE!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Search for the Stolen Meat\r\n\r\nMihono: Pant... Pant... Where's the aradama? Where's my meat?\r\nMirja: Get a hold of yourself, Asakura Mihono. For the time being, we've cleared the nearby area of aradama.\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan... I'm amazed how focused she is on this.\r\nEllen: She's beaten the most aradama by herself, hasn't she? Mihomiho's potential is off the charts-.\r\nNao: The spectrum meter is faintly reacting, but since we helped everyone evacuate for now, it should be safe~.\r\nNao: The toji in charge of this area have arrived too.\r\nChie: I understand how you must feel, Mihono-chan, but if you keep fighting like this you'll burn yourself out. You can't afford to push yourself too hard.\r\nMihono: Okay... Ahh, I'm feeling hungry now... If this was going to happen, we should've done the barbecue as soon as we got here-.\r\nMihono: Aradama must be meat eaters after all! When I was in Chinatown, they showed up at the meat bun shop too!\r\nEllen: Have you ever actually seen them eating though? From my Papa and Grandpa's research, aradama shouldn't eat meat or other foods.\r\nMihono: Ehh-!? So wait, they took it even though they aren't gonna eat it!? They're just being mean!\r\nChie: That's the part that makes you upset, hmm...\r\nNao: If I had my favorite food stolen out from under me right as I was looking forward to it, I think I'd be just as upset as Asakura-san~.\r\nNao: Especially the mandarin oranges I have sent to me straight from the farm every winter. I'd hate to lose those.\r\nMirja: Oh, do you mean the ones we take when we stop by your room from time to time?\r\nNao: The ones I put out for you are just from the supermarket. Besides those, I always get just a few shipments of first rate mandarins~. But you're not getting any~.\r\nMirja: I'll look forward to this year's winter then. And spread the word to Mizushina Kinuka.\r\nNao: Hey, Mirja!?\r\nKiyoka: You two get along so well. I hardly ever see Mirja-san teasing with someone like this!\r\nNao: Well, we are senpai and kouhai from the same school, and we've been hanging out together for a long time too~.\r\nKiyoka: I think it's nice to have that kind of relationship.\r\nMihono: That should be enough of a break, right?\r\nMihono: We have to get that meat back, so everyone who came here to barbecue today can go home with good memories!\r\nChie: That's right, we have to work our hardest.\r\nMihono: And no matter what, I'm not giving up on my meat!!\r\nKiyoka: It's no good if we don't get your meat, Hono-chan. It looked so delicious, and this was the perfect chance to make some observations during the barbecue. We can't afford to lose it!\r\nMihono: Let's go, Kiyoka! We'll beat the aradama and barbecue! We're coming to get you, my meaaaaat!\r\nKiyoka: Eh? Kyaaaaa!? Hono-chan... You don't have to drag meee...!\r\nEllen: They'll make us look bad at this rate. We have to help make sure everyone can have a fun barbecue too!\r\nChie: I don't know why Mihono-chan is acting so unreasonably. I have to keep a close eye on her, as her onee-san. Mm!\r\nMirja: We should follow as well, Uraga Nao.\r\nNao: Hmm, seeing everyone run off all willy nilly like this is making me wonder a little what the point of teaching everyone battle formations is~.\r\nNao: In spite of all that, Asakura-san and them still manage to function as a team somehow. It's beyond me~.\r\nMirja: About that, I do hold a similar impression, however, what matters most is our work right now.\r\nNao: Ah, wait for me, Mirja~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Let's BBQ!!\r\n\r\nMihono: WELCOME BACK! MY MEAT!\r\nEllen: And nobody got hurt by the aradama either. All the food that was stolen got recovered, so everything turned out okay.\r\nEllen: We put the smiles back on the faces of everyone who came here to barbecue.\r\nKiyoka: They gave us all sorts of food to eat as thanks too.\r\nEllen: We have to make the most of their generosity by enjoying our trip here to the fullest.\r\nMihono: With that out of the way, let's grill the meat!\r\nNao: Hold your horses~. You can't go spreading the meat across the whole grill. I know you want to grill it all as soon as you can, but still~.\r\nMirja: If we want the meat to be cooked all the way through, shouldn't we begin grilling them as soon as possible?\r\nNao: That's true, but we have to arrange things depending on the heat. Where there's lots of charcoal packed together, where it's spread out, and where there's hardly any.\r\nNao: The highest temperature areas are reserved for the meat, and the vegetables that heat poorly. We can put the Shiitake and peppers and the like where there's remaining heat on the sides.\r\nMihono: That makes sense... Leave it to the BBQ Boss!\r\nMirja: I see I was right to call you here.\r\nNao: I'm not a commanding officer for nothing, you know~. You need a plan for everything, even cooking up delicious meat, alright?\r\nNao: For example, when you see it getting burned from the high heat, you should move it somewhere with a lower temperature~.\r\nNao: And then, you wait until it's cooked all the way to the center~. That'll make the outside nice and crunchy, and the inside...\r\nMihono: All juicyyy!\r\nNao: You got it~. Anyway, I'll tell you which ones are ready to eat.\r\nNao: The ones right in the middle are good to go. The foil wrapped mushrooms next to it should be fine too~.\r\nEllen: Here, Mihomiho. You eat this one.\r\nMihono: Can I?\r\nChie: Of course; you're the one who brought it for us. You worked the hardest to suppress the aradama too.\r\nMihono: Then... I'm digging in~! ...Omfh!\r\nMihono: MMMM~~~~!!\r\nKiyoka: I can tell how tasty it is just from the look on Hono-chan's face... Gulp.\r\nMihono: ...You don't need words when it comes to meat. Eat up, everyone, come on! Come on, Uraga-san, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Th-Then... H-Here I go, Hono-chan!\r\nKiyoka: ...!!\r\nKiyoka: S-So good... It's so good, Hono-chan!\r\nMihono: Right?\r\nNao: This really is some good meat~. I'll keep on grilling them up for you, okaaay~.\r\nMihono: And we'll keep on eating them-! Omh... Ahh~, I'm so glad to be here right now...\r\n\r\nEllen: Nothing beats eating meat under a clear blue sky. Chew chew... Delicious~.\r\nEllen: If only Kaoru could have come along.\r\nChie: I know, Kaoru-san is always so hard at work... Chew chew.\r\nMihono: Urgh... Huh...?\r\nMirja: ...With such a deep flavor... I doubt I could ever tire of eating it. Chew chew...\r\nKiyoka: Nn...? I feel...\r\nMirja: However... It would be unfair to leave Uraga Nao in charge of all the preparations, so we should assist her as we enjoy ourselves.\r\nNao: Thank you~. Ah, be sure not to use the tongs you use to pick up the meat with any of the other food, okay?\r\nMirja: Understood.\r\nMirja: By the way, Asakura Mihono, Musumi Kiyoka. Is something wrong? You haven't moved your chopsticks or joined the conversation for some time now.\r\nMihono/Kiyoka: ......\r\nMihono: That's because... When I eat the meat, there's this weird feeling around my chest...\r\nKiyoka: Me too...! That's what it feels like...\r\nChie: Oh goodness, do you have heartburn? Is it because you've been eating nothing but meat, I wonder?\r\nMihono: Th-This is that heartburn stuff!? I think this is the first time I've had it...\r\nMihono: And now I can't even eat my meat I worked so hard for~, I don't believe this...\r\nKiyoka: Ah-! Look, Hono-chan...!\r\nKiyoka: Chie-san, Ellen-san, and them... They're eating all kinds of food besides the meat!\r\nKiyoka: We should try eating the same as they do for now.\r\nKiyoka: It could help with our alliance activities, and we can cleanse our palates a little. Maybe after a while, we'll be able to eat meat without getting heartburn?\r\nMihono: Th-That sounds like it could work?\r\nKiyoka: Then, let's not wait around... It's time to take action!\r\nKiyoka: Chie-san, what you're eating, is that cheese fondue? Could we have some?\r\nChie: Of course. But, since you're feeling heartburn, shouldn't you take a short breather? I'll be sure to set aside some food for you two.\r\nKiyoka: No thanks, I feel fine! When it comes to our objective... Girls have another stomach for this! Right, Hono-chan?\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah.\r\nNao: We have potatoes, pumpkin, bread, and mushrooms here, so go ahead and grab a mouthful~.\r\nMihono: Hot... It's hot! But the cheese is so yummy that I can eat it normally!\r\nKiyoka: The cherry tomatoes go great with it too! I think... This is going to work, Hono-chan.\r\nMihono: Yeah!\r\nMihono: (If I just wait a bit for the meat... I'm sure I can eat it like normal too!)\r\n\r\nMirja: (Strangely, it seems Asakura Mihono and Musumi Kiyoka have been copying whatever we eat for some time now?)\r\nMirja: (No, there can't be any deeper reason for it. Sometimes food simply appears tastier after watching another eat it.)\r\nMihono: Alright, time to dig into the meat again! That was just a fluke before!\r\nMihono: When it comes to meat... Where there's a will, there's a way!\r\nMirja: (It seems I was mistaken after all.)\r\nMihono: That sizzling sound it makes is so nice. Think it's ready-? They said to be careful not to overcook it.\r\nMihono: You're having some too, right Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: Right...! Thank you, Hono-chan! Let's give it a try!\r\nMihono/Kiyoka: Ahm...!\r\nMihono: Mmmggh.....!?\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nMihono: Why... Why...!? Even though it's so good! What's with this!? It's like my chest is saying no to the meat!\r\nKiyoka: ...Hono-chan...! I'm feeling it... too...!\r\nMihono: We can eat everything else okay, but... Uuu... My meat...\r\nKiyoka: And Chie-san and the others are still eating the meat without a care in the world... Why is it only us...\r\nKiyoka: Don't tell me... If your breasts grow big enough, you can eat without getting heartburn?\r\nKiyoka: No wait, don't they say that you have to eat a lot of meat to grow bigger!?\r\nKiyoka: Then that means... If we can't eat because of heartburn, then we won't...!\r\nMihono: All I wanted to do was eat the yummy meat...!\r\nMihono/Kiyoka: ...WHY DID THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN~~!?"}, {"paste_key": "vUR0QMia", "title": "4-3 To Overthrow Tagitsuhime", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/vUR0QMia", "timestamp": "", "hits": "110", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djF6hKbn0Po\r\n\r\n1: Yui's Condition\r\n\r\nMale News Anchor: In regards to the strange phenomenon affecting the capital, along with the frequent appearances of aradama, Miss Tagitsuhime, as well as the Sword Administration bureau, have yet to make any statement--\r\nSana: What do you think?\r\nYukari: She abandoned them.

Ahh, you mean this other cookie? Ahaha! So you spotted me secretly grabbing two, huh~!\r\nMai: Please, just stop, Kanami-chan...\r\nEllen: We all understand, Kanamin. Just how hard this is for you.\r\nSayaka: Even I can tell you're forcing it, Kanami.\r\nKanami: Wh-What do you mean, forcing it...? Come on, guys. Am I really acting that weird?\r\nKaoru: You don't have to force yourself to smile if you don't want to.\r\nKanami: ...I told Hiyori-chan. That it was too much for her on her own, so I'd carry half of it...\r\nKanami: And still... When it mattered most, I couldn't reach her...\r\nKanami: I couldn't keep my promise either... In the end, Hiyori-chan had to deal with everything by herself... I couldn't do anything for her...\r\nMai: Kanami-chan... We all feel the same way... Okay?\r\nKanami: Mai... cha...\r\nKaoru: ...She's right. It's the same for us.\r\nSayaka: We couldn't... Keep our promise.\r\nEllen: I'm sorry, Kanamin. Something this difficult got forced on you...\r\nNene: Ne...\r\nMai: That's why... It's okay, Kanami-chan. You don't have to hold it in anymore...\r\nKanami: ...kay...!\r\nKanami: --I'll be fine now. Sorry, that I made everything so difficult.\r\nEllen: It's not a problem at all.\r\nSayaka: Mm. You're the one always helping us.\r\nKanami: Then, on top of that, there's something I want to ask you.\r\nKanami: If nothing else, I want to get it back... Kogarasumaru. Hiyori-chan's okatana.\r\n\r\nChie: President Maniwa. The gate to the netherworld is only getting wider, isn't it.\r\nSana: That's right. We might not have much time left...\r\nSana: By the way, you might have already found out, but Ayanokouji Martial Arts School's President Souraku has returned to command the situation.\r\nSana: And, because of that, I've been given control of your investigation team for the time being.\r\nChie: Yes, I understand.\r\nKofuki: So? What'd you call us here for right after you took charge?\r\nSana: Right, about that. I thought Kitora and Musumi would be back by now, but...\r\nMihono: Um, before that! How is Yui doing now?\r\nMihono: After she injected herself with that ampoule, we haven't heard anything about her... Only that they put her in the hospital...\r\nSana: Yamashiro is still undergoing medical treatment. From what the doctors said, she made a remarkably fast recovery, but they still haven't approved her release yet.\r\nSana: That speedy recovery is probably the effects of the ampoule Yuzuki-senp... Commander Souraku came up with.\r\nYui: Excuse me!\r\nMihono: --Eh-!? Yui!? Are you alright now!?\r\nYui: Yep! I'm all better!\r\nYui: --Or I wish I could tell you that, but the doctors said I still shouldn't be moving around yet... Ahaha...\r\nKofuki: Wait, hang on, you just came running in here now.\r\nYui: See... I just wanted to see you all so badly, so I went and ignored what the doctors told me! ...Teehee!\r\nSana: You're a real idiot, aren't you?\r\nYui: ...Please, hear me out, President Maniwa! They keep bringing toji in, all these girls hurt fighting aradama, one after another into the hospital!\r\nYui: When I saw that... I just! I couldn't stay lying around in bed while that went on!\r\nSana: You were pretty badly injured yourself, you know...\r\nYui: I'm fine! Please! Let me come back to the investigation team! Let me go on missions!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Kashuu Kiyomitsu and the Asakura Family\r\n\r\nSana: Let you back into the investigation team? Let you go on missions? You know I'm not going to allow that!\r\nSana: Yamashiro! Didn't the doctor tell you you still shouldn't be up and about?\r\nYui: But I can't stand the idea of going back to a hospital bed! If you don't let me come back, I'll follow the investigation team on my own! Stalking is what I'm best at!\r\nMihono: When she puts it like that, it's pretty convincing...\r\nChie: Yui-chan. I understand feeling like you can't just sit by, but you need to listen to what the doctors say...\r\nKofuki: I mean, if she's saying she's fine herself, isn't it fine if we let her come with?\r\nKofuki: If anything goes wrong, I'll put a stop to it real quick.\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan. You can't go making wild suggestions like...\r\nKofuki: No really, Chichie. Think about what kinda person she is. Even if we leave her behind, she's gonna do everything she can to come after us.\r\nKofuki: Even if we manage to lose her, she's probably just gonna find some other toji to stick to.\r\nChie: Mm... You have a point... Thinking like that, it might be best to have her with us from the start, where we can keep an eye on her so she doesn't push herself too hard.\r\nYui: Kofuki-san! You believe in how much I can help, don't you! Thank you so much!\r\nMihono: I think what Fukki believes in is the dangerous side of your personality...\r\nMihono: Still, I agree with Fukki. If Yui says she's fine, then I think we should trust her!\r\nMihono: Please, I'll ask you too! Let Yui back into the investigation team! We'll all look after her the best we can!\r\nSana: You'll all look after her? She's not a puppy...\r\nSana: ...Sigh. Fine. If you're not going to give up on it, I'll allow her back into the investigation team, on one condition.\r\nSana: If your commanding officer, Kitora, decides you're struggling to continue fighting, you'll withdraw from the battlefield immediately. Meet that condition and you're in. Am I clear?\r\nYui: Yes-! Thank you very much! And thank you too, everyone! I'll do everything I can to make up for the trouble I've caused you!\r\nSana: It's possible Kitora could decide at any point to deny your place on the team. If that happens, be sure to do as she says.\r\nYui: Wait... Come to think of it, why haven't I seen Mirja-san's gorgeous self or Kiyoka-chan's lovable self?\r\nSana: That's because, on Kitora's proposal, the two have been taking care of something...\r\nMirja: Kitora Mirja and Musumi Kiyoka have made their return.\r\nSana: Kitora, Musumi, good work you two. You came at just the right time.\r\nSana: Ah, Shichinosato. This is the reason I called you all here.\r\nKofuki: Nn...? What's that supposed to mean?\r\nSana: Kitora and Musumi were sent out to Kamakura to look through an archive of the Sword Administration Bureau's records.\r\nChie: The Sword Administration Bureau's...\r\nMihono: Records...?\r\nSana: So then, Kitora, Musumi. Did you find anything?\r\nKiyoka: Yes! We found it!\r\nMirja: I had arranged for the details to be organized in a separate file and transported here... Do you mind if I speak about our findings for now?\r\nSana: Go ahead. That'd save us some time.\r\nMirja: In our investigation into the relationship between Kashuu Kiyomtisu and the Asakura lineage, as I suspected, we found a record of an ancestor of Asakura Mihono using Kashuu Kiyomitsu to seal a great aradama in the netherworld.\r\nMirja: Though, to be more precise, it is specifically because of its lethal status as a great aradama sealing okatana that it was handed down through the Asakura family for generations, and is currently in Asakura Mihono's possession... Or so I believe.\r\nSana: Then, to sum it all up...\r\nSana: Kashuu Kiyomitsu, like Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, could exist in both the netherworld and our world, and potentially strike a fatal blow to Tagitsuhime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Commence Operation! (1)\r\n\r\nAt roughly the same time, in a separate briefing room--\r\n\r\nMaki: Yukari-sama... Have there been any reports about Yomi since then...?\r\nYukari: ...We've still heard nothing.\r\nSuzuka: Is that so...\r\nYume: Yomi-onee-san, where'd she go...\r\nYuzuki: ...As of today, it's been a week since she was last sighted. We should prepare for the worst...\r\nYume: Yomi-onee-san would never die that easy!\r\nKanami: Excuse us!\r\nKanami: I have a request to make. Please let us sortie.\r\nYuzuki: Sortie... Do you mean, to go after Tagitsuhime?\r\nKanami: Yes! At the very least, so we can get Kogarasumaru... Please let me get Hiyori-chan's okatana back!\r\nYuzuki: I see. And do the other four of you agree on this?\r\nMai: I do!\r\nSayaka: Please let us go with her.\r\nKaoru: The gate to the netherworld is spreading way further, so we can take a look at things while we're out.\r\nEllen: Though we might even beat Tagitsuhime while we're at it!\r\nNene: Nene-!\r\nYuzuki: ...Fine then. I'll approve your request to sortie. But only provided you do whatever it takes to make it back to us.\r\nYume: It's no fair that Chidori-onee-san gets to do everything! President Souraku, let us go sortie too! I want to save Yomi-onee-san!\r\nSuzuka: Yume has the right idea. So long as the possibility exists, we can't give up on her.\r\nMaki: ...Commander Souraku. We wish to sortie too.\r\nMaki: We have to be there for Yomi-- for our comrade, if at all possible.\r\nYuzuki: ...I understand. But only on the condition that you suppress any aradama you encounter at ground level.\r\nMaki: Yes ma'am! Thank you very much!\r\n\r\nEllen: It's like the end of the world here...\r\nMashiko: If we lose, that's what it really will be.\r\nSayaka: Mai, that's...\r\nMai: Mm, that's where Tagitsuhime is...\r\nKanami: Just watch, Hiyori-chan... Kogarasumaru... I'll get it back for sure.\r\nMai: Is everyone ready? In this battle, we need to--\r\nKaoru: No point starting from there now.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nEllen: That's right! I'm sure we all feel the same way!\r\nSayaka: You can count on us, Mai.\r\nMai: We're going to cut open a path for Kanami-chan!\r\nMaki: Leave the aradama on the ground to us.\r\nSuzuka: Etou-san. You keep marching straight ahead.\r\nYume: ...Ah! They're already coming out!\r\nAradama: SHAAAAA!\r\nYume: It's our job to deal with the aradama! Maki-onee-san! Suzuka-onee-san! Let's go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Commence Operation! (2)\r\n\r\nYukari: From this point forward, we will split into two groups. Etou's group will move with me to Tagitsuhime's location, at the Tokyo Station building.\r\nKanami: You're coming with us, Yukari-sama!?\r\nYukari: My experience from being fused with Tagitsuhime could prove useful. And more than anything, I need to be there to see this through to the end.\r\nMai: It would be reassuring having you with us. Thank you.\r\nSayaka: Mai, let's do our best.\r\nYukari: The elite guard will eliminate all aradama in the vicinity as they search for Yomi.\r\nYume: Sure thing!\r\nMaki: We'll find her, whatever it takes.\r\nSuzuka: Yukari-sama, please look after yourself.\r\nYukari: Right. You three do the same.\r\nYukari: Now-- Commence the operation!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Kashuu Kiyomitsu's Potential (1)\r\n\r\nChie: Kashuu Kiyomitsu could fatally damage Tagitsuhime...? Do we know that for sure...?\r\nSana: Let me repeat, it could potentially do that. The Sword Administration Bureau currently doesn't place that level of importance on Kashuu Kiyomitsu either.\r\nMirja: However, there is something that caught my interest. The other day, when Asakura Mihono suppressed that great aradama, Tagitsuhime suddenly arrived.\r\nMirja: It may be possible that she was sensing the potential threat that Kashuu Kiyomitsu posed.\r\nKiyoka: But, she left again without doing anything about Kashuu Kiyomitsu.\r\nKiyoka: Don't you think that, if Tagitsuhime was fine with leaving Kashuu Kiyomitsu alone, she decided it couldn't be any danger to her...?\r\nSana: Hm... At any rate, with just what we know now, we can't say anything conclusively...\r\nKofuki: That means there's nothing to do but cut Tagitsuhime and see what happens.\r\nYui: Nice thinking, Kofuki-san! It's so simple it's scary!\r\nSana: It might be simple, but there's a point to it.\r\nSana: On top of that, whether or not Kashuu Kiyomitsu has some special effectiveness against Tagitsuhime, if you girls were to sortie, it would make things a whole lot easier for Etou and the rest.\r\nSana: ...Asakura, what do you think?\r\nMihono: --I want to find out. Whether or not Kiyomitsu can defeat Tagitsuhime.\r\nMihono: And more than that, if Kanami is fighting Tagitsuhime, I can't stay here doing nothing.\r\nSana: Guess there was no point in asking. In that case, I'll get authorization from Commander Souraku to let you sortie with Etou's unit.\r\nMihono: I won't let you down!\r\nYuzuki: So you were in here, Sana.\r\nSana: Commander Souraku, I was just about to come get you. Did you need something from me?\r\nYuzuki: Just now, I sent Yukari along with Etou Kanami and her unit after Tagitsuhime. Along with them, the three elite guards were sent to search after Yomi.\r\nYuzuki: With the lack of available toji, the defense of the nearby area has gotten thinner. I was wondering, if the investigation team is free at the moment, could I ask them to help--\r\nYui: Ehh-!? Kanami and them just left!? We're already one step behind-!\r\nYuzuki: ...? Did something happen?\r\nSana: I can explain why later, but these girls want to go after Tagitsuhime too.\r\nYuzuki: Are you serious about this...?\r\nYuzuki: I understand; I'll approve it. I'll find someone else to handle defense of the area. ...I'm counting on you, Kitora.\r\nMirja: I won't let you down!\r\n\r\nYui: Umm, hey... Everyone? I just can't stop thinking, I have to apologize to you, to make things right...\r\nYui: I'm sorry for what I did!\r\nYui: You all went out of your way to accept me into the team, and... I can't believe I used my okatana against you!\r\nYui: When I think about it now, I don't know why I acted like that, like it was normal... I can't get it out of my head...\r\nYui: I'm just really sorry...\r\nMihono: Yui... We get it! It's all okay now!\r\nMirja: Everyone here understands just what sort of effect that brainwashing had. By no means was it your fault.\r\nChie: Yui-chan, nobody blames you for anything.\r\nKofuki: Yeah, so quit acting all serious. Just go back to your usual self.\r\nKiyoka: More than anything, I'm just so happy we were able to get you back.\r\nYui: You all... Thanks...\r\nKofuki: Still, I'm surprised Mirja let Yui come with us just like that. I was sure she'd put her foot down harder.\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie stated it as, \"that way we can keep an eye on her, to stop her from acting recklessly,\" didn't she? I agree with that point of view.\r\nMirja: However, Yamashiro Yui. If you do behave recklessly, I will order you to retreat on the spot. If I determine you are unable to continue fighting, I will make the same order. Please do not forget that.\r\nYui: I won't!\r\nChie: With that settled, let's get moving!\r\nKiyoka: Wait, look at that!\r\nAradama: GGGGAAAAAAAA!!\r\nYui: Now's a good time to test out my strength! Just watch how much I can do!\r\nMihono: But don't push yourself too hard, okay, Yui!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Kashuu Kiyomitsu's Potential (2)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: I was worried, after Yui-chan had to stop by the doctor, but...  It looks like we don't have to worry about her now.\r\nYui: Mmhm! I guess modern medicine just couldn't compare to my love for Kiyoka-chan!\r\nKiyoka: I don't really understand what she's saying though...\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui being able to move without difficulty is possibly an effect of the strengthening drug used by the elite guard.\r\nYui: Yeah! I feel just great! I'm not getting slowed down a bit!\r\nChie: Still, be sure you don't do anything to force yourself. I agree with Mirja: \"if you behave recklessly, you'll retreat on the spot.\"\r\nKofuki: --That's enough talking for now. There's no point in doing this if we don't catch up to Yukari-sama and them before they fight Tagitsuhime.\r\nMihono: That's right! Come on, let's hurry!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: This Heat in Me (1)\r\n\r\nKaoru: Come on already, what's with all the aradama here.\r\nNene: Ne-! Nenne-!\r\nMai: Kanami-chan! Go on ahead!\r\nKanami: Okay!\r\nMai: Yukari-sama. Please take care of Kanami-chan.\r\nYukari: I will!\r\nEllen: That's...! Doesn't seem like aradama are our only enemy here!\r\nAyumu: --Etou-san!\r\nKaoru: Whoa-! Now the imperial guard are dropping out of the sky too!\r\nSayaka: I won't let you!\r\nAyumu: Itomi-san! Please don't get in my way!\r\nSayaka: Kanami, keep going!\r\nKanami: I got it!\r\nAyumu: Why are you stopping me!? You don't have anything to do with this, Itomi-san!\r\nSayaka: ...That's not true. I'm like a senpai to you.\r\nAyumu: I know about that! You ran away, didn't you!\r\nSayaka: I just found something more important.\r\nAyumu: More important...? What's more important than getting stronger! Please get out of my way!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: This Heat in Me (2)\r\n\r\nAyumu: ...Why can't, I keep up... Not with Itomi-san... Or with Etou-san...\r\nSayaka: ...Now it's my turn to save someone. You won't cut anything--\r\nSayaka: With that soulless sword!\r\nAyumu: AAHHHHHH!!\r\nAyumu: ...I think, I finally understand... Etou... sa...\r\nSayaka: --I've sure you feel this heat in you too.\r\nEllen: Saaya! Great work!\r\nKaoru: Looks like we dealt with all the imperial guard here.\r\nMai: Let's follow after Kanami-chan and Yukari-sama!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: Yomi's Objective (1)\r\n\r\nYume: Hey, hey, where do you think Yomi-onee-san could be?\r\nSuzuka: If we only knew what Yomi-san was trying to accomplish, we could have some idea...\r\nYume: Ahh, geez! If we just had Yomi-onee-san here, she could use her searching powers to find Yomi-onee-san!\r\nMaki: If we had Yomi, we could find Yomi? Yume... Are you even paying attention to what you're saying...?\r\nSuzuka: Though, I understand how Yume must feel... Even if the way she expressed it was so contradictory.\r\nMaki: The elite guard aren't one until there's four of us, right?\r\nYume: That's it! You're good at saying stuff, Maki-onee-san!\r\nSuzuka: Yume! Be on your guard!\r\nAradama: GRRRUUUUUU...!\r\nYume: They're here again! I just wanna find Yomi-onee-san as fast as I can!\r\nMaki: Eliminating aradama is a part of our mission. We'll get rid of them quickly so we can continue searching for her!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: Yomi's Objective (2)\r\n\r\nMaki: Look at that, you two!\r\nSuzuka: Those are... Aradama used by Yomi-san!\r\nYume: Then that means, Yomi-onee-san should be somewhere over there?\r\nMaki: Chances are high that's the case. Anyway, let's go look.\r\nSuzuka: The Tokyo Station building is in that direction. What could Yomi-san be doing there...?\r\nSuzuka: Besides that... She wouldn't ordinarily use so many aradama. Yomi-san. What could push you this far...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: Why I Fight (1)\r\n\r\nChie: There's so many aradama...! After each one we defeat, another one comes right out...\r\nKiyoka: We've been fighting aradama constantly since we left, and it feels like we aren't making any progress... I wonder if we're actually catching up to Yukari-sama and the others...\r\nMirja: Our only option now is to make every effort believing that's the case.\r\nKofuki: The aradama-chan are getting way too excited. I wish they'd just let us get to Tagitsuhime and I'll play with them later.\r\nHana: --Get to Tagitsuhime!? What are you up to!\r\nMihono: The imperial guard!? And...\r\nYui: Hana-san!\r\nHana: Yui...!? Why are you with the investigation team...\r\nImperial Guard A: Did you betray us!?\r\nMirja: ...This is bad. If we fight against Suzumoto Hana and the guards here, we'll lose a significant amount of time...\r\nYui: HAAAAAAAAA-!!\r\nChie: ...Yui-chan!?\r\nYui: Let me handle this; go on ahead!!\r\nMirja: But...!\r\nYui: I'm just going to hold them off! I won't push myself too far! If things get rough, I'll run away! It's not like I plan on dying either!\r\nYui: So keep going! This is all for nothing if you don't make it to Kanami-chan and them!\r\nMihono: Let's go, guys! Yui's right!\r\nMirja: ......kh.\r\nKofuki: We're just wasting time standing here! Mirja!\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui! You have to come back alive! That's an order!\r\nYui: Right! That's the one order I'll obey no matter what!\r\nHana: Yui... Traitors have to pay! You're going to be purged!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: Why I Fight (2)\r\n\r\nHana: Th-This isn't right... Why is there such a difference in power between you and us...\r\nYui: I got to use something special on myself. But, just between you and me, the side effects are seriously messing me up. I can't tell you how bad this thirst is, but it's taking everything I've got to fight it.\r\nHana: ...Yui, why'd you betray us? Don't you want to see the ideal world Tagitsuhime-sama is creating?\r\nYui: Ideal world? This here is what Tagitsuhime created by opening the gate to the netherworld.\r\nHana: It's a necessary sacrifice to create her paradise.\r\nYui: That's just selfish reasoning. When I became a toji, I did it to protect Miku.\r\nYui: --Ah, Miku, my little sister who's beyond cute, she caught this kind of complicated disease, so ever since she was little, she's been in the hospital.\r\nYui: Miku loves to study, so there's always piles of heavy books in her hospital room. Her dream is to be a schoolteacher someday.\r\nYui: If Miku were healthy, she could easily make that dream a reality.\r\nYui: --But her sickness took all her possibilities away from her.\r\nYui: I might not be able to cure Miku, but so long as I'm a toji, I can afford to get Miku the best treatment she can have. That's why I'm a toji.\r\nYui: A world that treats Miku... The person I'm fighting to protect! Like a sacrifice! There's no way that could be a paradise!\r\nHana: What are you losing your nerve for now...!\r\nYui: If we defeat Tagitsuhime, your brainwashing should be broken too. Then I think you'll understand what I'm telling you.\r\nYui: I'm not losing my nerve at all. This is what matters most to me. So, until then-- please rest.\r\nHana: Urgh...\r\nYui: --Now then. Honestly, I've been fighting pretty hard to keep going, it hurts like crazy all over, and I think I've got a fever. But, I'll power through it somehow!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: 1 Lost in Action\r\n\r\nSana: There's nothing abnormal in the vital signs of all the toji sortieing right now.\r\nYuzuki: No one's been seriously injured then. They're doing well for themselves out there.\r\nSana: They are. Makes me wish my younger self could've learned a thing or two from them.\r\nSana: Though, this is all because...\r\nYuzuki: I know. Juujou Hiyori, 1 toji lost in action... That's a heavy figure.\r\nSana: We can't let that number grow any higher. We have to get them all the logistical support we can give.\r\nYuzuki: Still, times will come that we have to prepare ourselves for. For those times... That's what I'm ready to be commander for.\r\nSana: ...My heart goes out to you."}, {"paste_key": "zvJVzHbp", "title": "Chain Story Archives Part 2.5", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/zvJVzHbp", "timestamp": "", "hits": "153", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "[Due to this event being released across 3 months, there are 3 separate videos]\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRw4QiWULI0\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhIKOCOdky8\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fV4ehWn5Gw\r\n\r\n1: The Investigation Team, Dissolved\r\n\r\nNot long after Tagitsuhime, fleeing to the netherworld, spread aradama-- special hazardous waste across the entirety of Kanto.\r\n\r\nMihono: Excuse me.\r\nHashima Ema: I'm sorry to call you in here when you're so busy with your duties.\r\nEma: I wanted to speak with you about what you'll be doing from here on out, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: ...From here on out?\r\nEma: You don't have to look so anxious. You understand what the state of things is like now, don't you?\r\nEma: The entire country, not only Kanto, has seen a rise in the frequency of aradama appearances. And not a day goes by without debate over Kamakura's special hazardous waste leakage issue being broadcast on television.\r\nEma: They're going to be airing Akane-sama's hearing very soon too.\r\nMihono: ...I know. Nothing's like it used to be.\r\nMihono: There weren't this many aradama before, and the STT didn't spend this much time busy with missions.\r\nMihono: Everyone from the investigation team never even gets to see each other anymore...\r\nEma: About the investigation team, its activities are going to be suspended.\r\nMihono: There's not going to be an investigation team anymore!?\r\nEma: It shouldn't go away just yet.\r\nEma: But, at least until the special hazardous waste problem is settled, you all won't be taking any action as part of the investigation team.\r\nMihono: ...Then, when you said we'd talk about what I'll be doing from now on, do you mean you're putting me in some other unit?\r\nEma: Asakura-san.

It will be difficult, but I think it would be a good experience for you.\r\nMihono: Umm, when you say the Five Traditions, do you mean Minoseki?\r\nEma: You wouldn't be wrong to think that.\r\nEma: You might be relocated elsewhere... say, to Renpu, but you'll primarily be working with Minoseki.\r\nMihono: ...That might be better then?\r\nMihono: Though, would I know anyone who's working with the MPD?\r\nEma: Of course. There are others loaned to them, some who you should be familiar with... Let's see, Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san should have transferred there.\r\nMihono: Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san did...?\r\nMihono: (Uuu... I don't know. I never did get their phone numbers, so maybe I should go there?)\r\nMihono: (But, if I get transferred, I don't really know what' I'd be doing. I feel like I'd get to be more useful working here with Mai and the others.)\r\nMihono: (Yeah, I'll go with that. I'll get their phone numbers sooner or later, I know it!)\r\nMihono: ...Okay, I've made up my mind, President Hashima. I'm going to work hard here helping the STT.\r\nEma: ...That's fine.\r\nEma: You'll be part of one of Minoseki's units, Asakura-san. Though, the offer to transfer to the MPD will always be available, so if you ever change your mind, come right here and tell me.\r\nMihono: Okay!\r\n\r\nMihono: HAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nNagae Futaba: Wha, Mihono!?\r\nMihono: We have to focus, Futaba! Let's take care of the aradama first! We can talk later!\r\nFutaba: R-Right!\r\nFutaba: (I just went along with her, but... Is it me, or did Mihono get a heck of a lot stronger!?)\r\nFutaba: (I remember Mihono being a lot more... Did something happen to her when she was with the investigation team?)\r\nFukuda Sawano: ...\r\nSawano: (...It's only natural Nagae-san would be surprised. Compared to how she was during the tournament qualifiers... Asakura-san is fighting like a completely different person.)\r\nSawano: (Working with the investigation team should have benefited her, but... Would it have made this much of a difference?)\r\nSawano: ...Asakura-san! Can you take care of things here? I'll go support the other units!\r\nMihono: Sure, just leave it to me!\r\nFutaba: Sawano-san, what should I do!\r\nSawano: ...Please come with me, Nagae-san! Asakura-san can handle herself here!\r\nFutaba: ...Okay!\r\nFutaba: (The way I am now, I'd just be weighing Mihono down... It's so frustrating! It wasn't that long ago that I could fight neck and neck with her!)\r\nMihono: HAAA!!\r\nAradama: GGGOOOOUUU!!\r\nMihono: Grr, it's fast...\r\nMihono: But still! I was working hard with the investigation team... So if I just calm down, I can do this!\r\nMihono: Alright! Now for the next one!\r\nFutaba: ...Keep it up, Mihono!\r\nFutaba: (You'll see, I'll be right there fighting alongside you again soon!)\r\n\r\nMihono: Pant... Pant...\r\nToji A: KYAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: -!? Are you okay!?\r\nSawano: Don't lose your focus! Help is already on the way!\r\nMihono: R-Right!\r\nSawano: Those who can't apply utsushi, help move the injured away from here! Nagae-san, keep them safe!\r\nFutaba: On it!\r\nMihono: Sawano-san and Futaba can take care of things there! I have to... Defend this place no matter what!\r\nAradama: GYUUUUOOOO!!\r\nMan: Whoa-!? S-Somebody help meee!!\r\nMihono: -!? --Jin'i!!\r\nMihono: Are you alright!?\r\nMan: Why the hell would I be alright!? Do something about that monster already!\r\nMihono: O-Okay!\r\nMihono: HAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: Now's your chance, please get away to safety!\r\nMan: Get away to safety?\r\nMan: I never got attacked by aradama before... Before you toji screwed everything up!\r\nMihono: ...!\r\nMihono: S-Sorry...\r\nMan: Goddammit, why did this happen to me...! You're supposed to show up before anyone gets hurt!\r\nMihono: (We're doing the best we can to fight... So why...)\r\n\r\nFutaba: Mihono-, great work back there-.\r\nMihono: ...Yeah, you too, Futaba.\r\nFutaba: ? You look kinda down; did something happen?\r\nMihono: ...Nah, it's nothing!\r\nMihono: I think I'm just a little worn out after how rough things got back there. Let's get back to school quick!\r\nFutaba: Anyway, is it me, or did you seriously get way stronger, Mihono? What kind of training did you do? Did you hide away in the mountains or something!?\r\nMihono: It wasn't like that-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Outbreak of a Large Scale Aradama Disaster\r\n\r\nAnnouncement: A large scale aradama disaster has occurred. The toji on loan from the Five Traditions should prepare to sortie at once.\r\nAnnouncement: I repeat--\r\nHana: We only just got transferred here, and we've already got a hard job to do.\r\nYui: How bad do you think it's going to be? Hopefully it'll be like, \"They made it sound so much worse!\", but...\r\nHana: I feel the same, Yui. That's all we can hope for.\r\nHana: Looks like they sent the info to our phones.\r\nHana: ...!\r\nYui: The affected area is an entire district...\r\nHana: We're responsible for a shopping mall?\r\nYui: A shopping mall; that's pretty big, isn't it...\r\nHana: At the bare minimum... There could be several thousand shoppers there now.\r\nYui: Several thousand!? How is our unit supposed to take care of all those people on our own!?\r\nHana: Let's calm down.\r\nHana: ...I think the MPD will have figured the same thing. I wouldn't be surprised if they're calling the Five Traditions for backup right now.\r\nHana: More importantly... Every moment we spend here, the number of victims is getting bigger.\r\nHana: We have to go now.\r\nYui: Right!\r\n\r\nMan: (I never got attacked by aradama before... Before you toji screwed everything up!)\r\nMihono: ...We screwed everything up?\r\nMihono: I couldn't tell him no... I mean, after what happened with Tagitsuhime...\r\nMihono: ............\r\nMihono: ......This isn't helping! Sitting around like this isn't how I do things!\r\nMihono: I'm going to go ask the president to send me on more missions!\r\n\r\nMihono: Excuse m...\r\nEma: A large scale aradama disaster?\r\nEma: You're right, that location is right on our doorstep, however... We don't have toji available that quickly.\r\nEma: Yes, we need time to organize a unit, and.... Eh? I understand that, but...\r\nMihono: (Large scale aradama disaster...?)\r\nEma: Then let's see... I'll need an hour at the least, before they can arrive there...\r\nMihono: (An hour... By the time an hour passes, how many people will get hurt...)\r\nMihono: President Hashima, please let me go there!\r\nEma: Asakura-san!?\r\nEma: ...I don't have many, but I'll send out the toji who are ready at once. Prevent any casualties as best you can until our units arrive.\r\nEma: Are there any areas that are most threatened? ...Yes... Alright... Understood.\r\nEma: Asakura-san, you heard what we were discussing, didn't you?\r\nMihono: I did! Where should I go?\r\nEma: I want you to go straight to the shopping mall. You're to join forces with Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san there.\r\nMihono: Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san!?\r\nMihono: (Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san are already helping at the mall...)\r\nMihono: (Come to think of it... Why did those two agree to transfer to the MPD anyway?)\r\nEma: Do you understand? Rather than suppressing aradama, saving lives is your top priority. Think only about keeping casualties to a minimum.\r\nMihono: Got it!\r\n\r\nMai: Mihono-chan!\r\nMai: There was a large scale aradama outbreak! They're organizing units, so we should go!\r\nMihono: Yeah, I know about it!\r\nMai: Eh?\r\nMihono: Just now, they called President Hashima for help with it. So I'm... I'm going on ahead!\r\nMai: Be careful, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: I will!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: At the Site\r\n\r\nEma: I want units sent to the three areas under the greatest threat!\r\nEma: Gather Inago Akira, Fukuda Sawano, and Yanase Mai! Organize each of them a unit as fast as you can!\r\nMinoseki Instructor: President Hashima, Inago Akira still hasn't come to school.\r\nEma: Then find someone else with leadership experience. I'm going to try getting ahold of Inago-san.\r\n\r\nInago Akira: ~~~~~!\r\nAkira: C'mon, I was just getting in a good mood here. ...Huh? President Hashima?\r\nAkira: What's up? It's Inago Akira.\r\nEma: Inago-san? Where are you right now?\r\nAkira: Just cruising 'round near school; you need something?\r\nEma: There's been a large scale aradama disaster. I wanted you to be in charge of one of the units responding, however...\r\nAkira: Since you're not waiting for me to get back, it must've really gone to hell, huh.\r\nEma: I would appreciate it if you would return right away...\r\nAkira: Hey-, you know it wouldn't be me if I came back so fast.\r\nEma: Really now, don't admit that about yourself.\r\nEma: Inago-san, I need for you to go to the shopping mall. I just allowed one of the middle school toji to leave for there in advance.\r\nAkira: She's got guts. What's her name?\r\nEma: Asakura Mihono-san. She made it rather far in the qualifiers for this year's tournament...\r\nAkira: ......Asakura Mihono, huh. Yeah yeah, I know her.\r\nAkira: Alright, I'll be there before you know it.\r\nAkira: First though...\r\nAkira: Ah, you there? That mall right next to Minoseki... Oh, you heard already?\r\nAkira: Yeah yeah... Anyway, it sounds like Asakura Mihono'll be there, so I'm going to go see for myself.\r\nAkira: Alright, time to floor it!\r\n\r\nToji A: The insertion team has returned! Many people are injured!\r\nToji B: The civilians take priority! Any toji who can no longer fight, fall to the rear!\r\nToji A: Roger!\r\nCitizen A: My friend is still inside there! You have to hurry and rescue them!\r\nToji B: You don't have to worry. They're working right now to rescue everyone they can...\r\nCitizen B: Give it a rest! Instead of making excuses, why don't you get in there and save them! That's what you get paid for, isn't it!?\r\nMihono: ...This is awful.\r\nMihono: (Ordinary people... And toji too. There's so many of them getting hurt...)\r\nCitizen C: I saw all about it on TV! It's because of their negligence that the aradama came spreading everywhere!!\r\nMihono: ...!\r\nMihono: (Because we defeated Tagitsuhime... Was it wrong for us to do that...?)\r\nMihono: ...I'm a toji from Minoseki, here to help. Where are Suzumoto-san and Yamashiro-san at?\r\nToji A: If you want Suzumoto-san, she came out with us just now. She should be...\r\nHana: Asakura-san?\r\nMihono: Suzumoto-san! Thank goodness I found you! President Hashima told me to meet up with you.\r\nHana: President Hashima did...? That'll help a lot.\r\nMihono: Where's Yamashiro-san?\r\nHana: She's still fighting inside.\r\nHana: We couldn't rescue all the people at once... So we're trading off leading the people we have saved outside.\r\nMihono: In that case, we should hurry in there!\r\nHana: ...\r\nMihono: Suzumoto-san? Are you feeling tired?\r\nHana: I am, but... I'm glad you're here, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: Ehh!? I haven't done anything yet...?\r\nHana: Having someone as straightforward and positive as you around makes me feel like I can keep going.\r\nHana: The situation is awful, but it's reassuring having you here. So much so that I wish you'd gone to the MPD.\r\nMihono: That's...\r\nHana: You don't sound interested in it. But, I'd be happy if you at least thought it over while we deal with this incident.\r\nHana: That said, this is also our first incident right after we transferred.\r\nMihono: It is?\r\nHana: That's right.\r\nMihono: It must be hard on you, having to start with something like this.\r\nHana: That's for sure; I'm worried about where things are going at this rate. But... I'm glad I decided to transfer.\r\nMihono: ...Huh? Shouldn't it be the other way around?\r\nHana: Should it?\r\nHana: I am feeling nervous, about getting thrown straight into this, and whether I'll be able to keep up if it's nothing but cases like this in the future...\r\nHana: But I know for a fact that I'll get to protect a lot of people. I'm not going to regret that.\r\nMihono: (Protect a lot of people... Suzumoto-san put lot of thought into deciding to transfer, unlike me...)\r\n???: KYAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nHana: ...! That scream came from...\r\nMihono: Let's go, Suzumoto-san!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhIKOCOdky8\r\n4: An Atmosphere of Unrest\r\n\r\nAkira: Seriously? People won't stop calling today... Tch, and it just had to be these assholes.\r\nAkira: Yeah?\r\n???: If you're entering the large scale aradama outbreak, you are to gather as much noro from it as possible.\r\nAkira: Huhh? Have you lost your damn mind? Try getting your priorities straight here!\r\n???: For that person's desire to be realized, a great amount of noro is needed.\r\n???: Inago Akira, you do understand, don't you?\r\nAkira: You sure love running your mouth, huh. You think naming them would make me do whatever you say?\r\n???: Everything is to fulfill that desire. It isn't as if I'm telling you to ignore the aradama, you know.\r\n???: Suppress the aradama, retrieve their noro, and... Keep an eye on the girl. You can do that, can't you?\r\nAkira: ...\r\nAkira: Yeah, sure, I got it! While I'm suppressing the aradama, I'll get you some noro!\r\nAkira: That good enough for you!?\r\n???: We have high expectations.\r\nAkira: FUCK!\r\nAkira: ...Sigh.\r\nAkira: Ahh, feels a little better letting it out like that! Damnit, this is starting to get on my nerves.\r\n\r\nToji A: Defend this position, no matter what!\r\nTojis: Right!\r\nMihono: There's this many aradama!?\r\nHana: It's like this everywhere inside. We keep killing them and killing them... And more aradama appear.\r\nHana: That's why we left our unit at a key location and went to secure an escape route.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nHana: Looking at it the other way, they can't move from there. So we have to force our way in.\r\nMihono: Okay!\r\n???: No! Stay away!\r\nMihono: Suzumoto-san, someone's calling for help!\r\nHana: ...That way, huh. Let's hurry, Asakura-san!\r\n\r\nMihono: There she is!\r\nHana: HAAAAAA!!\r\nWoman: ...\r\nMihono: Are you okay!?\r\nHana: Don't move her!\r\nHana: ...There's no injury on her head, and she doesn't seem badly hurt... Alright, she only lost consciousness is all.\r\nHana: It should be okay if we wake her up.\r\nMihono: H-Hang on a minute!\r\nHana: What is it?\r\nMihono: Ah, uh, it's just...\r\nMihono: (What if she starts acting the same as the people outside...)\r\nMihono: I think she was really scared of getting attacked by aradama... Wouldn't it be better if we let her stay asleep?\r\nHana: You have a point there.\r\nMihono: ...What's most important for us now is finding Yamashiro-san. I'll look to see if there's someone else around who can help her.\r\nHana: I'm counting on you.\r\n\r\nHana: I didn't expect that from you back there.\r\nMihono: Huh?\r\nHana: I was sure you'd offer to go and bring her outside yourself.\r\nMihono: Should I have?\r\nHana: No, it's good you didn't let your emotions get the better of you. You're right that we should focus on meeting up with Yui first.\r\nMihono: (Didn't let my emotions get the better of me? I did though...)\r\nMihono: Suzumoto-san!\r\nHana: Stay quiet... We can let this aradama go.\r\nMihono: Aren't we going to beat it?\r\nHana: Our number one priority is rescuing the people here. I know it sounds bad, but... Stopping the aradama comes second.\r\nHana: Good, it doesn't seem like it's noticed us.\r\nMihono: ...\r\nHana: Feeling frustrated?\r\nMihono: That's not it; there's just something on my mind... Um, can I ask you something?\r\nHana: What's that?\r\nMihono: Suzumoto-san, why did you choose to be transferred?\r\nHana: Why?\r\nMihono: My school's president asked me too; if I wanted to transfer.\r\nMihono: But back then, I told her no.\r\nHana: President Hashima must have high hopes for you, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: She does...?\r\nHana: Yeah. It's very hard working here, so they'd never recommend a toji without the strength to back it up.\r\nMihono: Ah...\r\nHana: Are you getting interested?\r\nHana: When I decided to transfer, I was thinking about the future. I wanted to build up a connection with the police.\r\nMihono: Suzumoto-san... You're so mature.\r\nHana: You think so?\r\n???: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: That voice was... Yamashiro-san!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5:\u3000At a Crossroads\r\n\r\nAradama: OOOOOOOOUUUUU!!\r\nYui: Whagh!\r\nYui: That's it for my utsushi... But, I'm not done yet!\r\nYui: HAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nYui: Pant... Pant...\r\nMan A: H-Hey, are you doing okay?\r\nYui: I'm fine, it's fine, this is a walk in the park!\r\nYui: ...ah, whoops.\r\nMan A: Look at you, you can barely stand up straight!\r\nYui: Ahaha, I think I'm just getting a little hungry.\r\nMan A: Why don't you rest for a while?\r\nYui: When Hana-san gets back, I'll take a break. Don't worry, she'll be back any minute now.\r\nMan A: Still...\r\nHana: Yui!\r\nMan A: It's that girl from before, and she brought help! Good, now you can get some rest.\r\nYui: Ooh! And she's a cutie too... Wait, that's Mihono-chan!\r\nHana: Mihono-chan? Yui, since when have you and Asakura-san been on a first name basis?\r\nYui: Never, but I'm in the camp that believes in calling cute girls by their first name!\r\nHana: I figured... Sorry about her, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: Ahaha, I'm totally okay with it! I'll call you Yui too then.\r\nYui: Thanks, Mihono-chan! I feel like I could fight for another five hours now.\r\nHana: Five hours? You're keeping it realistic, huh.\r\nMan B: What are you standing around gossiping for!? If you've got more toji, then start getting us out of here!\r\nMihono: -!\r\nMihono: (They're like this here too...)\r\nMan A: Don't talk to them like that! These girls are risking their lives fighting for us!\r\nWoman: You shouldn't pay him any mind. Thank you, for coming all this way... Really, truly, thank you...\r\nWoman: It was horrible... So many times, I thought it was all over...\r\nMihono: Ah...\r\nMihono: ...You don't have to worry! We'll keep you all safe, no matter what!\r\nYui: Then, let's get to it... whoops.\r\nHana: Don't overdo it, Yui. Asakura-san and I will keep guard, so you can take a quick break.\r\nYui: Ugh, sorry. I'll do that.\r\nHana: Oh, right.\r\nHana: Do you mind if I ask why you decided to transfer, Yui?\r\nYui: Where's this coming from? Could it be, you're just so interested in me you can't help it!?\r\nHana: Asakura-san asked me about it before. Now seemed like a good time, so I figured I'd ask you too.\r\nMihono: Thanks, Suzumoto-san.\r\nYui: Does that mean you're joining us, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Uhh, I'm considering it... After seeing things here, I started feeling sort of conflicted, I guess?\r\nYui: I see, so there's a chance, huh.\r\nYui: Hmm, okay. I guess I did it for the money? See, if you get loaned to the police, they start paying you a bit more.\r\nMihono: ...I kind of wasn't expecting that from you.\r\nYui: Fu fu fu, at Ayanokouji, they don't call me \"the girl you never see coming\" for nothing!\r\nHana: Did that help you any?\r\nMihono: Yeah. I can tell you and Yui both put a lot of thought into why you transferred.\r\nMihono: And I...\r\nMihono: (All I thought about was whether I'd stay with everyone. I should really... Think about it harder now.)\r\nMihono: What was that sound!?\r\nHana: It sounded like glass breaking, but... It's sort of unsettling not knowing what happened.\r\nMihono: I'll go check it out then! Suzumoto-san and Yui-san, you stay here!\r\n\r\n???: ORA!\r\nMihono: (Somebody's fighting?)\r\nMihono: (The broken glass... Is that a motorcycle? Did the motorcycle come crashing through?)\r\nMihono: (But why in here...?)\r\n???: C'mon, I don't have time for you small fry. Quit swarming me, damnit.\r\nMihono: (She's backup? She's wearing a Minoseki uniform, but... I've never seen her before.)\r\n???: Finally...\r\nMihono: (!? She's collecting the noro? Why is she doing that now, like she's hiding it...)\r\nMihono: That's enough!\r\n???: Huh?\r\nMihono: I'm Asakura Mihono, second year at Minoseki Academy's middle school division! What are you doing out here?\r\n???: ...Asakura Mihono.\r\n???: ('Course she'd be suspicious of a toji acting on their own in a place like this.)\r\n???: (Wasn't planning on making contact yet, but... Can't exactly explain what I was doing with the noro to her...)\r\nMihono: ...\r\n???: (Kashuu Kiyomitsu... It really is broken.)\r\n???: (Or, well...)\r\n???: You've gotta lot of nerve, don'tcha? Just gonna point your okatana at your senpai like that? Huhh?\r\nMihono: ...First, just answer me this. What are you doing here?\r\n???: First, gimme an apology for pulling your okatana on me. I'm your senpai, y'know?\r\nMihono: ...\r\n???: ...You asked for it.\r\n???: (For starters, I'll knock some sense into this bratty kouhai of mine! I can come up with something after!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Evaluation\r\n\r\nMihono: ...\r\nMihono: (This girl, she was collecting noro in secret...)\r\nMihono: (The head of the Origami family was doing the same thing, when she was possessed by Tagitsuhime...)\r\nMihono: (Whatever her reason, I'd better stop her!)\r\n???: It's not in me to waste breath arguing.\r\n???: Let's go.\r\nMihono: -!?\r\nMihono: (That was so fast... And she hits hard too!)\r\n???: HAAA!!\r\nMihono: Grh!\r\nMihono: (She's... Really strong!)\r\n???: (...She's got some muscle. But, eh, that's how it is.)\r\n???: ...Alright, I get the gist of it.\r\nMihono: Of what?\r\n???: (Can't go wasting much time here in these circumstances.)\r\n???: Just say goodnight for now!\r\nMihono: ...!!\r\nMihono: ...\r\n???: Man, what're they teaching in the middle school these days? Don't go turning your okatana on your senpai like that.\r\n???: ...Well, actually, I guess it was my fault this time.\r\nYui: Mihono-chan!\r\n???: Huh?\r\nYui: GET AWAY FROM MIHONO-CHAAAAAAN!\r\n???: Thought you'd get me by surprise!? Too bad; I'm used to that!!\r\nYui: Gh...\r\n???: What was with her?\r\nHana: ...What do you think you're doing, Inago-san?\r\nAkira: Me? She's the one who jumped me. Wait, do I know you?\r\nHana: Suzumoto Hana. I've seen you a few times through Mokusa.\r\nAkira: ...Ohh, you're with Mokusa too. That's perfect.\r\nAkira: I'm juggling what Mokusa and President Hashima want from me. Things've been getting annoying, so I was going it alone, and this one spotted me.\r\nHana: ...Is that how it went.\r\nHana: (President Hashima likely told her to do the same thing she told Mihono... So what did Mokusa want her to do?)\r\nHana: (Well, she probably wouldn't give me an answer even if I asked.)\r\nAkira: That's my story, so when they wake up, I'm counting on you to help explain.\r\nHana: Please try explaining things yourself before you get into a fight...\r\nAkira: Hey, they're the ones pointing their okatana at me?\r\nAkira: If someone tries putting me down, I'll make them regret it.\r\n\r\nHana: Anyway, that's Inago Akira-san.\r\nAkira: I'm Inago Akira. Good to meet you.\r\nAkira: Sorry about before; I just took you out on reflex.\r\nYui: No, don't worry about it! More importantly... Can I call you Boss!?\r\nAkira: Sure, call me whatever.\r\nYui: Will do!\r\nAkira: And, I didn't mean for things to get out of hand before, Mihono. I lost my cool and wasn't thinking straight.\r\nMihono: No, I shouldn't have taken out my okatana before I even asked you anything.\r\nMihono: Though, if President Hashima sent you, you should've said so sooner.\r\nAkira: My bad, but President Hashima didn't tell me anything more than to head over here.\r\nAkira: So, to make it up to you, let me help you guys out.\r\nAkira: I won't feel right if I don't pay you back.\r\nMihono: Sure, we'd be glad to have you, Inago-san!\r\nAkira: Akira's fine, Mihono.\r\nMihono: Okay! Akira-san!\r\nMihono: (Still... Why was she taking that noro? Was that part of President Hashima's orders too?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/-fV4ehWn5Gw\r\n7: Inago Akira, the Toji\r\n\r\nMihono: This is the third time we've gone in, isn't it?\r\nYui: At this point, it's hard not to feel a little exhausted.\r\nAkira: Oi, no losing focus.\r\nMihono/Yui: Right!\r\nHana: She looks okay now, but... Yui's stamina might be reaching its limit.\r\nAkira: Doesn't that go for you too? Your swings are losing their sharpness.\r\nHana: ...You could tell?\r\nAkira: How could I not?\r\nAkira: You ready? This is the last insertion. We're too late in the game for somebody to get seriously hurt here.\r\nHana: ...I know.\r\nAkira: But still, don't go complaining. We're not about to leave a single person behind either.\r\nHana: Right!\r\n\r\nMihono: Hmm, there's nobody around here.\r\nYui: It'd be a lot easier to search for people if we could shout for them, but then the aradama would come running...\r\nHana: We're just going to have to search place by place as we go.\r\n\r\nYui: Pant, pant...\r\nMihono: Are you okay?\r\nYui: Fine, just fine, I'm just so happy, surrounded by all these cuties.\r\nHana: If she can joke around like that, she must be fine.\r\nAkira: ...Shut up for a second.\r\nMihono/Yui: I-I'm sorry!\r\nAkira: Just shut up!\r\nAll Three: ......\r\nAkira: ......\r\nAkira: I knew I heard something.\r\nHana: Heard what?\r\n???: ......dy.\r\nMihono: Ah, someone's saying something!\r\nYui: Over that way!\r\n\r\nBoy: Ah... Some toji ladies...\r\nHana: You were hiding in here?\r\nYui: It's easy to overlook, isn't it.\r\nAkira: Damnit, why don't you pick somewhere easier to find.\r\nBoy: Eep...\r\nAkira: Huhh?\r\nBoy: UWAAAAAHHHHH!\r\nYui: Boss made him cry!\r\nAkira: C'mon, if you're a man, then quit crying.\r\nBoy: B-Buttt...\r\nAkira: You managed to hold out on your own for this long, didn't you?\r\nBoy: Y-Yeah.\r\nAkira: Then, quit crying. You'll never keep anybody safe if you're crying all the time.\r\nBoy: ......Okay!\r\nAkira: Good, 'atta boy!\r\nMihono: He stopped crying...\r\nYui: That's why she's the boss!\r\nHana: Does that have anything to do with it?\r\nAkira: Alright, Mihono! You're in charge of this brat!\r\nMihono: Eh?\r\nAkira: He was crying up a storm.\r\nAkira: 'Course it was gonna attract aradama.\r\nBoy: It's my fault...\r\nAkira: Don't start crying! ...Just wait there!\r\nBoy: ...!\r\nAkira: Good boy; like that. Just leave all this... to me!\r\n\r\nAkira: ORAA!\r\nMihono: Wow... Ow, hey, you're grabbing on too hard...\r\nBoy: ...\r\nMihono: (He's watching her so seriously now... Even though he was crying before...)\r\nBoy: You can do it, toji lady!\r\nMihono: (To this kid, Akira-san must look like a hero... She is pretty cool, isn't she.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Self-Consciousness and Determination\r\n\r\nToji: You can leave that boy with me.\r\nAkira: Counting on you.\r\nAkira: So long, brat! You be good!\r\nBoy: Thank you, toji lady!\r\nAkira: Yeah, take care.\r\nAkira: 'kay, he should be fine from here. Let's put in some effort and check the rest out.\r\nAll Three: Yeah...\r\n\r\nAkira: Guess it's about time we took a break. You've all gotta be at your limit, right?\r\nHana: I am...\r\nYui: That's our boss... You can tell it all...\r\nMihono: Yeah, the usual missions are tough, but... This is on a whole different level.\r\nYui: That's cause it isn't so easy as just coming out here, beating all the aradama, and everything's okay.\r\nMihono: From now on... There's going to be a lot more disasters like this happening, won't there.\r\nMihono: And... A lot more people will get hurt...\r\nHana: That's what we're here for; to save as many of those people as we can.\r\nMihono: That's true...\r\nAkira: Is something on your mind?\r\nAkira: Go ahead and let me know then. I've always got time to give a kouhai some advice.\r\nMihono: I always have this feeling like, I've gotta do something, but I'm not sure what it is I should be doing...\r\nAkira: ...Ahh, I think I get it. A buddy of mine, they've got the same kind of worries.\r\nAkira: I don't know if it's exactly the same, but you're wanting to change yourself, right?\r\nMihono: I guess I want to change?\r\nAkira: Yeah. That's mostly how it is for them. Wanting to get tougher.\r\nMihono: -!? I think you might be right!\r\nAkira: In that case, you've got to challenge yourself. Do whatever's toughest, cause that's what's best for you.\r\nHana: (...Inago-san, she seems like the type who's good at looking after others. Calling her boss wasn't too far off the mark.)\r\nMihono: Whatever's toughest... Maybe I will transfer to the police.\r\nYui: You mean it!?\r\nYui: Between Hana-san and Mihono-chan, I'd have a pretty girl whichever way I look!\r\nAkira: Dumbass! Don't drop your guard! \r\nYui: Eh?\r\nAradama: UUUOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nYui: Gah!\r\nAkira: Mihono, Hana, get your utsushi up!\r\nMihono: On it!\r\nHana: Kh...!? I can't...!\r\nAradama: GAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nHana: Ggh-!\r\nAkira: Tch, you're both at your limit then... Oi! If you're still breathing, then say something!\r\nYui: I'm hurting, but, I'm fine...\r\nHana: Same here... But, I don't think I can fight any more.\r\nAkira: HAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nAkira: Don't sweat it! I'm not letting you two get hurt again!\r\nYui: Boss...\r\nAkira: Mihono!\r\nMihono: Y-Yes!\r\nAkira: You get it now, right? What a toji needs is strength!\r\nMihono: ...Right!\r\nAkira: Now, do what I tell you! We're not gonna let the aradama come near Hana or Yui anymore!\r\n\r\nAkira: Push out, and stop that aradama coming for us!\r\nMihono: YAAH!\r\nAradama: OOOUUUUU!!\r\nMihono: Urgh...! I managed to stop it, somehow, but...!! Akira-san, I can't hold it off!\r\nAkira: That's plenty; you did good, Mihono.\r\nMihono: Ah...\r\nMihono: (Akira-san, she really is strong... I'm... nowhere near that.)\r\nAkira: ORAORAORA! Let's keep it going!\r\nMihono: (...I do want to get stronger.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: The Next Step\r\n\r\nMai: HAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nSawano: With that, nearly all the aradama in the area should be suppressed now.\r\nSawano: You were working hard, Yanase-san.\r\nMai: Yes, you too.\r\nMai: Um... Fukuda-san, do you know where it was that Mihono-chan went to fight?\r\nSawano: If I remember... She should be at the shopping mall.\r\nMai: The shopping mall...\r\nSawano: You can go if you want. I can take care of the rest here.\r\nMai: Thank you very much!\r\n\r\nMai: Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Ah, Mai!\r\nFutaba: Hey, Mihono! Since when did you become friends with Yanase-san?\r\nMihono: Uhh, a little while ago?\r\nMai: ...I'm glad you're safe, Mihono-chan. I heard lots of people were getting injured, and it made me worried.\r\nMihono: Yeah, I'm just fine, but...\r\nMai: But?\r\nHana: They seriously did a number on the both of us.\r\nMai: Suzumoto-san, and Yamashiro-san too!? Are you two okay...?\r\nHana: Doesn't feel like I'm doing that great.\r\n\t[ambulance siren]\r\nYui: Ah, sounds like our ride is here, Hana-san.\r\nHana: That's our ride...?\r\nYui: Seeya around, Mihono-chan! If you have the time to pay us a visit, you'll make my day! Okay!\r\nMai: She really wanted to make a point of that while they carried her off...\r\nMihono: That's Yui for you!\r\nFutaba: Anyway, Mihono, since when did you become friends with girls from Ayanokouji?\r\nMihono: Umm, a little while ago?\r\nFutaba: You just keep saying that!\r\n\r\nMihono: Excuse me.\r\nEma: Asakura-san? Thank you, for your efforts the other day. What did you need?\r\nMihono: Err... About what you said, about transferring to a unit under the MPD's command, can I still do that!?\r\nEma: Of course, that would be fine, though... Did something happen?\r\nMihono: Yeah. I talked to Yui and Suzumoto-san, and Akira-san gave me advice... I made up my mind.\r\nEma: It sounds like you got the encouragement you needed.\r\nEma: I understand. In that case, starting today, you'll be transferred to the Metropolitan Police Department.\r\nMihono: Starting today!?\r\nEma: Yes. Ever since you asked to be sent to the mall, I've been expecting this to come.\r\nEma: The preparations were taken care of.\r\nMihono: Uwah... Is it really that easy to tell what I'm going to do?\r\nEma: I've seen a lot of girls like you, Asakura-san. For all of them, working with the MPD was a good experience.\r\nEma: I hope the same will be true for you, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: ...Okay! I'm going then!\r\n\r\nMihono: Hey, is Inago Akira-san here?\r\nSawano: If you're looking for Inago-san, she isn't here yet...\r\nMihono: Do you know how soon she'll be here?\r\nSawano: Hmmm, I'm not sure? There are plenty of times Inago-san doesn't even come to school...\r\nMihono: Oh, okay...\r\nMihono: (I wanted to thank her about what happened before school started...)\r\nMihono: (But I guess Akira-san's a delinquent after all.)\r\n\r\nAkira: Hello?\r\nAkira: Yeah, sorry. It wasn't in the plan, but I made contact with her.\r\nAkira: Mm... Yeah. There's no signs of her awakening yet.\r\nAkira: I think it's probably gonna take a bit more time.\r\nAkira: Yeah, got it. I'll keep on watching Asakura Mihono."}, {"paste_key": "TKXeuXDv", "title": "Revue: Stage Girls and Toji no Miko", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/TKXeuXDv", "timestamp": "", "hits": "153", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nstX1sl6Xmo\r\n\r\n1: The Training Camp Runs into Trouble\r\n\r\nThe Dance Recital; a fine arts festival presented through a collaborative effort by the Five Traditions.\r\nIts main attraction: a dance performed in miko attire by eleven select toji.\r\nThis year, the girls chosen were as follows: Shidou Maki, Konohana Suzuka, Satuki Yomi, Tsubakuro Yume, Etou Kanami, Yanase Mai, Juujou Hiyori, Mashiko Kaoru, Kitora Mirja, Yamashiro Yui, and Shichinosato Kofuki--\r\n\r\nMaki: We're going to do a full rehearsal of the performance now. Ban Tsugumi, you're in charge of the music.\r\nTsugumi: Right, you can leave the supporting role to me. Ready... Starting the music.\r\nTsugumi: Three, two, one...\r\n\r\nMaki: That's wrong, all wrong! Ban Tsugumi, stop the music! Yume, Mashiko Kaoru, Shichinosato Kofuki!\r\nMaki: You weren't keeping the pace! We're starting again, from the top!\r\nYume: Ehh~, againnn? I'm bored of this already~.\r\nKaoru: I thought I'd get a break from dealing with aradama here, but this might be worse...\r\nKofuki: Hey, how long're we gonna keep doing this for? Isn't this good enough already?\r\nMaki: Until you can deliver a perfect performance for Yukari-sama, of course.\r\nMaki: That's the entire purpose of this training camp. Now, let's keep going...\r\nSuzuka: Wait, Maki-san. It's about time we gave them a break.\r\nYume: Hooray-! A break-!\r\nMaki: Hold it, Yume! I didn't say we were taking a break yet!\r\nMaki: Suzuka! They still have a long way to go before they're ready! Do you think we have time to stop now!?\r\nSuzuka: That's exactly why we should.\r\nSuzuka: This training camp will last quite some time. They'll need a degree of rest every now and then, won't they?\r\nMaki: But...\r\nKaoru: We'll still be practicing tomorrow, won't we? Let us rest a minute.\r\nMaki: That's not your place to decide...\r\nMaki: ...Maybe I have been pushing you too hard though.\r\nMaki: We're taking a break, everyone. You can all rest until Yume, Mashiko Kaoru, and Shichinosato Kofuki can manage that performance.\r\nKaoru/Kofuki/Yume: Ehh~!?\r\n\r\nKanami: Ahh, I'm worn out-.\r\nMai: We've been dancing all this time, after all.\r\nHiyori: Maybe it's because we're using different muscles than usual, but I'm feeling a lot more tired than I expected.\r\nMirja: This seemed likely to happen, so we do have honey lemon slices prepared. Would you all like some?\r\nHiyori: Honey lemon slices... That would be nice.\r\nKanami: Thank you, Kitora-san!\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui, please hand them out.\r\nYui: I'm on it, Mirja-san!\r\nYui: You can eat these soury sweet honeyed lemons right out of my hands! And you can lick my fingers clean too if you want!\r\nMirja: Stop that, it's unsanitary.\r\nMai: Haha... Thank you, Kitora-san. I can make another batch for everyone tomorrow.\r\nMirja: Good, I'll tell Ban Tsugumi that she won't need to make any more.\r\nKanami: Nn~! Sweet and sour... And bitter!? Eh!? Why's it so bitter!?\r\nHiyori: What's this powder mixed in with the honey!? Though... I feel like dancing now!\r\nMai: ...I think I won't eat any after all.\r\nMirja: ...That may be for the best.\r\n\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, you are moving your hands incorrectly. Mashiko-san, your body has stopped moving. Shichinosato-san, please do not try to fall asleep.\r\nSuzuka: ...The training camp has only just begun and we're already behind schedule.\r\nMaki: I didn't expect it to be such a struggle. There are lots of minor points they aren't able to keep up with, but...\r\nSuzuka: It's the finishing act, isn't it.\r\nMaki: As toji, they should all be skilled enough for this.\r\nMaki: And despite that, for them to be this this incapable of coordinating their performance...\r\nSuzuka: We still have time before the recital. I'd like to believe they can work things out with enough practice.\r\nMaki: Why now, at a time like this...\r\nTsugumi: Shidou-san, there's a report of an aradama outbreak in the area...\r\nMaki: We'll all go. You'll join us, Ban Tsugumi.\r\nTsugumi: That's fine, but it's best if we go quickly. Tsubakuro-san and Shichinosato-san have already rushed on ahead.\r\n\r\nKofuki: Nice timing back there, aradama-chan! I love you for real-!\r\nYume: I'm glad we got to leave practice, but these are all weaklings, so it's still boring!\r\nYume: ...By the way, Onee-san. Where are we?\r\nKofuki: Beats me? All I cared about was chasing down the aradama-chan, so I wasn't paying attention.\r\nYume: Ehh-!? You're no help at all.\r\nKofuki: Playing with aradama-chan was bound to be a million times more fun than that lameass dance practice.\r\nMaki: ...Found you! Don't go running off on your own!\r\nSuzuka: Is this a theater? Was there a theater this close nearby?\r\nGiraffe: I understand.\r\nYume: Wah-!? A talking giraffe!\r\nKofuki: Is that an aradama too? Should I cut it up to be sure?\r\nTsugumi: Please wait, Shichinosato-san. I've never seen an aradama with such a close resemblance to a giraffe before.\r\nTsugumi: We should attempt to gather information on it through communication first. You can cut it up when we're done.\r\nGiraffe: I am not an aradama, so may I ask you toji not to cut me.\r\nSuzuka: It knows what we are?\r\nGiraffe: Yes.\r\nGiraffe: I wish for you to suppress the aradama, so the audition may resume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: ...Could This Be Another World?\r\n\r\nMaki: All aradama in the area have been defeated. Suzuka, is the spectrum finder showing you anything?\r\nSuzuka: ...No, that should have been all of them just now. However...\r\nMaki: Suzuka? Is something wrong?\r\nTsugumi: It's not giving any response, Shidou-san. After entering this theater, the spectrum finder didn't react to the aradama at all.\r\nMaki: ...They didn't show up on the spectrum finders?\r\nTsugumi: Yes, this is a highly fascinating phenomenon!\r\nTsugumi: Could they be a new variety of aradama? Though, the structure of their bodies was familiar. Which might mean, the aradama have evolved in some way...\r\nMaki: Get a hold of yourself, Ban Tsugumi. ...Suzuka, is what she said accurate?\r\nSuzuka: Yes, I've confirmed it myself. Ban-san is telling the truth.\r\nMaki: So what's going on here...?\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san! Somebody's fighting some aradama over there!\r\nMaki: Grh, they just keep coming... Move in to help!\r\n\r\n??? (Karen): YAAAAAAAHH!!\r\nAradama: Gyaa...\r\n??? (Mahiru): Wh-What's going on here!?\r\n??? (Hikari): Think about that later. HAA!!\r\nAradama: GYAAA!\r\nKanami: Ehhh!?\r\nHiyori: They're killing aradama without okatana!?\r\nYui: And they're so cute to boot!?\r\nMirja: (As it seems, these are not ordinary aradama here... No, that's not what matters most now.)\r\nMirja: This is no time for you to fool around, Yamashiro Yui! Move to support those girls!\r\nKofuki: I dunno who you are, but hands off my aradama-chan!!\r\n\r\n??? (Karen): Thanks for the help! Those monster looking things came out of nowhere, and we didn't know what to do!\r\nKanami: We were just doing our job. We're toji, after all.\r\nKanami: And anyway, how'd you beat the aradama!? That's not an okatana, right!?\r\n??? (Karen): Otakara? [treasure]\r\n??? (Nana): Not treasure, Karen-chan. She said an \"okatana\".\r\n??? (Juuna): An okatana... Some type of sword? Like the ones you have, right?\r\n??? (Karen): Banana! And Junjun too!\r\n??? (Mahiru): Hey, Karen-chan... These girls, they might have something to do with what's happening...\r\n??? (Hikari): I think so too.\r\n??? (Karen): But, since they're here, that makes them stage girls like us!\r\nKanami: ...\"Stage girls\"?\r\nKanami: Like performers? Does anyone know about them?\r\nHiyori: Nope, not me.\r\nKanami: What about you, Mai-chan?\r\nMai: No, I haven't heard about them either.\r\n??? (Juuna): We're students of Seisho Music Academy. You've heard of that, right?\r\nYume: Seisho Music Academy? Do you know about it, onee-sans?\r\nYomi: No, I've never heard of it.\r\nSuzuka: I should be familiar with prestigious music academies, from socializing in those circles...\r\nSuzuka: But the name Seisho Music Academy doesn't ring any bells.\r\nMaki: Maybe it's not all that prestigious? \r\n??? (Maya): I'm not about to let that comment pass.\r\n\r\nKaren: There's no Starlight-!?\r\nKanami: What do you mean aradama don't exist!?\r\nClaudine: So, if I'm understanding this correctly, these girls came from another world?\r\nKaoruko: Could something out of a fairytale like that happen?\r\nFutaba: You fought them yourself, didn't you, Kaoruko? Those, aradama, you called them?\r\nKaoruko: ...It might have actually happened after all...\r\nKaoruko: Which all works out then.\r\nKaoruko: We've been in a pickle. The audition was suspended thanks to these aradama. Could you defeat them for us?\r\nSuzuka: Audition...? I haven't seen any judges here.\r\nJuuna: It's called an audition, but it isn't like any ordinary audition you're thinking of.\r\nJuuna: Stage girls fight amongst each other, aiming to be the top star.\r\nKofuki: Hmmm. Well, you don't have to ask. I'll get all the aradama-chan myself.\r\nMaki: Shichinosato Kofuki is right. Defeating aradama is our duty as toji.\r\nKaoru: Duty's great and all, but... If we beat them all, is that gonna send us back to our world?\r\nMaya: I believe things will work out.\r\nMaya: The giraffe asked for you to suppress the aradama. So, once they are all suppressed, he should send you back.\r\nMaki: Then there shouldn't be a problem. You can leave suppressing the aradama to us.\r\nKaren: ...But, is it really okay for us to make Shidou-san and them do all the work?\r\nMahiru: I feel the same way. It's not like it's the toji's fault the aradama are here...\r\nHikari: Besides, this is our audition.\r\nMaya: Which leaves us only one option: we will help suppress the aradama too.\r\nMaki: But, it's dangerous!\r\nMaya: Despite not being toji, we can defeat these aradama, can't we? There should be no issue then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: A Shared Resemblance\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san, there's aradama on our 9 o'clock. Did you notice them?\r\nKofuki: The hell, what is this place, aradama-chan heaven!? Bring it on! Just try and keep up!\r\nTsugumi: Don't mind me; go all out.\r\nKaoru: Look at them go-. At this point, can't we just leave everything to those two?\r\nNene: Nene!\r\nKanami: You know we can't do that! So long as aradama are here, they're causing problems for Karen-chan and the others!\r\nMai: That's right, Kaoru-chan.\r\nMai: And besides, if we don't get back soon... I'm sure Sayaka-chan and the others will be worried sick.\r\nMaki: Worried, huh...\r\nSuzuka: ...You're losing focus, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: Does it look that way?\r\nSuzuka: There's no other way of looking at it. Wouldn't you ordinarily be leading the charge against the aradama?\r\nSuzuka: But there are three concerns causing you to falter. Will we be able to go home? How is Yukari-sama reacting to this?\r\nSuzuka: And also... about the dance performance.\r\nMaki: ...I can't hide anything from you, can I.\r\nSuzuka: I'm simply worried about the same things you are.\r\nSuzuka: Since we have this opportunity, I'd like to ask these girls for their opinions on our performance. What do you think?\r\nMaki: Ask them?\r\nSuzuka: Yes. Their lives revolve around the stage, don't they? They should be able to offer us valuable insights.\r\n\r\nMaya: The closing act of your dance isn't coming along well?\r\nMaki: That's right. Aside from the very end, we can bring it together with few mistakes.\r\nMaki: But, no matter how many times we rehearse it, we never manage to synchronize the end.\r\nMaya: ...\r\nClaudine: It isn't as if your bodies stop moving, is it?\r\nClaudine: From watching you fight with the aradama, each of you should have more than enough basic physical fitness, so all that's left is for you to practice.\r\nMaya: ...Are they not losing sight of their direction?\r\nClaudine: What do you mean by that?\r\nMaya: Assuming the toji are also special students, there isn't a chance they would receive an utterly useless curriculum.\r\nMaya: In which case, their dance must also be treated as an extension of their everyday life.\r\nMaki: An extension of our usual life...\r\nMaya: That's right. Shidou-san, you've been attempting to deviate from your ordinary selves, have you not?\r\nMaki: ...You've hit the nail on the head, Tendou Maya.\r\nMaki: In focusing too heavily on acting as miko for our dance, we've lost sight of being toji.\r\nMaki: ...A theater pro really does see things differently. I'm glad I asked you.\r\nClaudine: I could have told you that much...\r\nSuzuka: (As expected, Tendou-san made a convincing argument. Though... I wonder what has Saijou-san looking so bothered?)\r\nSuzuka: (Her hostile attitude toward Tendou-san seems somewhat familiar...)\r\nYume: Hmmm. Hey, Yomi-onee-san?\r\nYomi: What is it, Tsubakuro-san?\r\nYume: Does Clau-onee-san remind you of anybody? She feels really familiar for some reason...\r\nSuzuka: Oh my, you had the same impression, Yume?\r\nYomi: ...That would be Konohana-san, wouldn't it? Though she hasn't acted like that for a long time.\r\nYume: Ehh, Suzuka-onee-san, did you used to be like that?\r\nYomi: Yes. Just like that.\r\nSuzuka: (...Ahh, so that's what it was.)\r\nSuzuka: Saijou-san?\r\nClaudine: What? It's true that you need to practice. I haven't said anything wrong either.\r\nSuzuka: ...I'm not here about that. It's difficult, isn't it? Following after another.\r\nClaudine: What are you talking about?\r\nSuzuka: There's someone who's captured your attention, isn't there?\r\nClaudine: ...Not really.\r\nClaudine: There's only someone I'm going to surpass. Without fail.\r\nClaudine: Oh, right, about getting opinions on your performance. Since you have the chance, why not ask all of us?\r\nSuzuka: Of course, we will--\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san, here comes another wave. We may need to break out the flag for this one. [Referring to a flag Japanese fishermen will hoist after catching a huge haul]\r\nKofuki: Was that supposed to be a joke!?\r\nKofuki: And besides, they're all mine! Nobody's taking them from me!!\r\nMaki: Suzuka! Yomi! Yume! We're moving in too!\r\nYomi: Understood.\r\nYume: It's boring fighting these weakling aradama though.\r\nSuzuka: Now that's how Maki-san ought to be.\r\nSuzuka: You've started acting like an elite guard again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Star We Sought\r\n\r\nMirja: After all that, it seems the amount of aradama appearing has decreased.\r\nYui: I think so too, Mirja-san!\r\nYui: If we keep up the pace, we'll be back home in no time... Wait, we can't!!\r\nKaoru: What's wrong with going home?\r\nKaoru: You want to stay in this aradama infested theater production from hell forever?\r\nYui: But still! The lovely ladies from Seisho! I still need to cozy up with them!\r\nHiyori: ...Do you listen to yourself talk?\r\nKaoruko: Lovely ladies, you say. Well, that's only a natural reaction.\r\nFutaba: Don't flatter yourself.\r\nKanami: I get what you mean, Yui-chan.\r\nYui: Kanami-chan! I didn't think I had an ally here!\r\nKanami: Everyone from Seisho, their movements are so beautiful. Right down to their fingertips; it's so precise!\r\nYui: ...That's not the kind of ally I was looking for!\r\nKaren: Stage girls are evolving every day!\r\nKaren: Even when fighting aradama, you can't forget about the stage!\r\nMirja: That's an interesting perspective, Etou Kanami. Unlike Yamashiro Yui's.\r\nMirja: Everyone from Seisho acts with such finesse, though their fundamental movements are all different.\r\nMirja: Is there something like schools of swordsmanship within theater performance?\r\nHikari: ...The difference in our fields of expertise?\r\nJuuna: It might be something like that. Isurugi-san, swordfights are your specialty, aren't they?\r\nFutaba: Yeah, I don't plan on letting anyone show me up when it comes to a swordfighting scene.\r\nMahiru: For me, it would be the baton?\r\nNana: The toji girls are the other way around, right?\r\nNana: There's differences in the details, but the way they move their whole bodies are all tuned for using a sword.\r\nMai: The way we move our bodies is tuned for using a sword... You mean our fundamentals are the same?\r\nMai: ...I wonder if that could help us improve our dance performance?\r\nKaren: Dance performance?\r\nMaki: I'll explain that.\r\n\r\nKaren: The toji are dressing up as mikos for a dance!?\r\nJunna: You're all so athletic, so it should be a real show seeing you all moving together.\r\nNana: Yeah, yeah. I wish I could be there to see it.\r\nKaren: Put on the show for us here!\r\nMaki: If we want your opinions, the best way would be to practice in front of you.\r\nYume: Ehh!? We're doing it now!?\r\nMaki: Tendou Maya. It might still be far from complete, but will you watch our performance?\r\nMaya: That's an important responsibility. Because it's incomplete, that's all the more reason for you to need our opinions.\r\nHikari: What do you mean?\r\nClaudine: They can't seem to get their closing act to come together.\r\nKaren: Why do you know that, Clau-chan!?\r\nClaudine: I heard it from them earlier. They said they wanted advice on how to improve.\r\nHikari: ...Why didn't you tell us?\r\nClaudine: We were going to, but then the aradama arrived. Anyway, let's move things along. Start your performance.\r\n\r\nKaren: That was so intense!\r\nJunna: Agreed. Getting to see it up close, you get such a sense that those okatana are the real thing.\r\nFutaba: When it comes to the dancing, that's Kaoruko's field, right? You want to help them out?\r\nKaoruko: You say that, but wasn't that closer to a combat demonstration than a dance?\r\nKaoruko: I don't have a single bit of advice to offer.\r\nNana: A combat demonstration... Ah, maybe that's why the just the last part felt different?\r\nMaki: That's it! Please, tell me more! What is our performance missing?\r\nKaren: It's hard to say exactly what... When you're swinging your okatana, it's like it's filled with emotion?\r\nKaren: It's like a real dance performance then.\r\nHikari: It must be because you have a clear image of a target in mind.\r\nNana: Aradama, right.\r\nMahiru: So then, why isn't the last part going as well?\r\nClaudine: ...It's because they can't get their mental images aligned, isn't it?\r\nClaudine: Just looking at Maki and Suzuka, there's force behind Maki's movement, but Suzuka's was more delicate, wasn't it?\r\nSuzuka:  Delicate? I wasn't intending to restrain myself...\r\nClaudine: I'm only talking about the difference I felt between what you two were picturing. Maki imagined cutting down an aradama, and...\r\nMaya: Konohana-san had returning her sword to its sheath in mind.\r\nClaudine: Well, that's about it.\r\nMaki/Suzuka: ...\r\nJunna: So, to sum it up, at the very end of this dance performance, you can't unify what you're all expressing?\r\nKaren: Yeah! That's it!\r\nKanami: Our mental image, huh. I think mine is staying on guard.\r\nMai: I think that's mine too.\r\nHiyori: I picture striking down my enemy.\r\nYui: I imagine ending everything with a big group hug!\r\nKaoru: Can't we just imagine taking a break, since it's done?\r\nHiyori: You two... Are you not going to take this seriously?\r\nAradama: GGGGAAAAAOOOOOO!\r\nHiyori: Tch, aradama!?\r\nSuzuka: Oh my, and a rather large one at that.\r\nClaudine: C'est pire! ...Could it not have given us a little more time here!?\r\nKaren: Why are you two acting so calm when there's that giant monster aradama!?\r\nMaya: Its size has nothing to do with this. They can at last see their performance taking shape.\r\nMaya: Once this aradama is defeated, their dance can be completed.\r\nMaki: Right, so let's go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: A Time We Surely Shared\r\n\r\nGiraffe: You've done well, toji. The audition will resume.\r\nKaren: If the audition's resuming... That means we took out all the aradama?\r\nKanami: Now we can go back home, Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: ...Can we really go back though? I don't even remember how we got here in the first place...\r\nMai: Come to think of it, just how much time has passed since we came here?\r\nKaoru: It might be like Urashima Tarou when we get back. [a fairytale about a man who spends time in an underwater kingdom and finds a century has passed when he returns]\r\nKaren: Hey, Kanami-chan and them can get back fine, can't they?\r\nGiraffe: Of course, I will dutifully return them home.\r\nMaki: That's good to hear.\r\nMaki: ...Before we go, could we show you our performance one last time? I want you to see the final act with all of our minds focused on the same mental image.\r\nMaya: We would be glad to.\r\nKaren: Cause we'll get to see an even better performance than before!\r\nHikari: ...I can't wait.\r\nNana: And this time, I'll be sure to take some good photos of it.\r\nJuuna: Is there any way we could exchange the pictures?\r\nMahiru: I wonder if we would have time to print it out?\r\nClaudine: Why don't we just test sending it to them now?\r\nFutaba: Test it... Do our phones work the same as theirs?\r\nSuzuka: They look to be the same. Daiba-san, would you mind sending me the data?\r\nNana: Sure thing. Here, point your phone this way.\r\nKaoruko: Anyway, how much time do we have left?\r\nGiraffe: They leave right now.\r\n\r\nKanami: Right now... Wait, huh? This is, the boarding house...? \r\nHiyori: It was a dream?\r\nMirja: Was that dream about fighting aradama in an underground theater, by any chance?\r\nMai: I had the same dream too!\r\nKaoru: Was it a dream?\r\nNene: Ne-?\r\nYui: Don't tell me... Those theater cuties were all a figment of my imagination!?\r\nSuzuka: No, I don't believe it was a dream.\r\nYume: Ah! Suzuka-onee-san! Is that picture the one Banana-onee-san sent you?\r\nSuzuka: That's right. I still have it, right here. Look.\r\nMaki: The advice they gave us... It won't go to waste.\r\nMaki: First, we're all going to synchronize our mental image of our performance! After that, we're going to practice!\r\n\r\nOn the day the dance performance would be shown to the public.\r\n\r\nMaki: (Everything's gone well so far... All that's left is the closing act... It'll be fine.)\r\nMaki: (We've shared our mental image, like the stage girls suggested.)\r\nMaki: (All we need is to...!)\r\nCheers: HURRAAAAHHHH!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Collecting Suzudaru Cats!\r\n\r\nKaren: There really are some things besides aradama that're different between our world and yours, Kanami-chan.\r\nKaren: You still have the Tokyo Tower, right? And it's still red like it's supposed to be, right?\r\nKanami: Yep, it's still red alright!\r\nHiyori: I wonder why things are different. Aradama and okatana don't exist...\r\nHikari: Starlight, which has been performed countless times around the world, doesn't exist...\r\nMahiru: Ah, that reminds me. I wanted to ask you something. Does Suzudaru Cat exist in your world too?\r\nMai: Suzudaru Cat? Hmm, I haven't heard of it. How about you, Kanami-chan?\r\nKanami: I've never heard of it either.\r\nMahiru: I don't believe it~... A world without Suzudaru Cat...\r\nHiyori: What kind of cat is it?\r\nYume: Hey, hey. What're you talking about?\r\nKaren: Yume-chan, Yomi-chan. We were just talking about how, isn't it weird how some things are different between our worlds?\r\nMahiru: Ah! It's Suzudaru Cat! So you have it in your world after all; thank goodness~.\r\nYomi: What do you mean, Suzudaru Cat?\r\nMahiru: Eh!? You're holding it right there~.\r\nYume: Huhh. So this thing's called Suzudaru Cat?\r\nYume: It dropped off of an aradama just now.\r\nMai: An aradama?\r\nKanami: That's Suzudaru Cat...?\r\nKanami: Woww... It's too cute, Mahiru-chan! There's this sort of unexplainable charm to it!\r\nMahiru: Isn't there? Suzudaru Cat has that kind of cuteness you just can't describe-!\r\nMahiru: Ahhh, I'm glad I found someone who can understand Suzudaru Cat's greatness~.\r\nKaren: I'm happy for you, Mahiru-chan.\r\nMai: You like those kind of mascot characters, don't you, Kanami-chan?\r\nKanami: Yeah, I love them!\r\nKanami: Hey, Tsubakuro-san, Satsuki-san? What was it like when you got that Suzudaru Cat?\r\nYume: Just before the aradama I killed dissappeared, it was like, poof!\r\nYomi: I can't say it will be the same for all aradama, but that's what it was like with the one we defeated.\r\nKanami: Cool, so while we suppress the aradama, we can also collect a bunch of Suzudaru Cats!\r\nMahiru: Defeating aradama means getting Suzudaru Cats...!\r\nMahiru: Etou-san! If it's alright with you, do you think you could... share some of the Suzudaru Cats you find?\r\nKanami: Of course! I'm not about to take them all for myself! Let's share them with everyone! Hiyori-chan, you're fine with that too, right?\r\nHiyori: I-I never said I wanted any, did I?\r\nKanami: But they're so cute. I know I'll come to like them soon enough.\r\nHikari: Mr. White is even more amazing though... [mumbled]\r\nHiyori: Did you say something, Hikari?\r\nHikari: ...I didn't say anything.\r\nKanami: Come on, let's go ask everyone to start collecting Suzudaru Cats from the aradama!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[WARNING. I didn't actually roll Mai so I only ever happened to see part 1]\r\nStage Girl Mai: Start: Two Triangles\r\n\r\nKanami: I can't wait to spar with all these stage girls! If I miss this, I'll never get another chance.\r\nKanami: You know, I've wanted to spar with them ever since we came here and saw them fighting those aradama.\r\nMai: You said the same thing back when you first saw Hiyori-chan at the tournament, didn't you, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: Ehehe.\r\nHiyori: You did? Though it sounds just like something you'd do.\r\nKanami: Ah, Hiyori-chan. What's up?\r\nHiyori: What do you mean, \"What's up?\" You're the one who said to meet here so we can spar now.\r\nKanami: Oh yeah! Then, let's get right to it, Hiyori-chan! I'll catch up with you later, Mai-chan~.\r\nMai: Okay. Be sure not to get hurt, you two.\r\nMai: ......\r\nMahiru: Mai-chan?\r\nMai: Tsuyuzaki-san? Did you need something?\r\nMahiru: Nothing in particular, but I was watching you with Kanami-chan. You seem close.\r\nMai: We sure are. As soon as we met in middle school, we were fast friends. We often spend time together, in classes and the dorms.\r\nMahiru: Just like Karen-chan and I. Since the start of high school, we've always been together as roommates! Though now there's three of us, since Hikari-chan moved in.\r\nMahiru: What about Hiyori-chan? Her uniform is different, so she's from a different school, isn't she?\r\nMai: We got to know Hiyori-chan during an incident at the tournament in our second year, and we've been friends ever since.\r\nMai: It all started with Kanami-chan befriending Hiyori-chan.\r\nMahiru: So that's what happened.\r\nKanami: Mai-chaaan, Tsuyuzaki-saaan! There's some aradama, so come over here!\r\nMai: We should go.\r\nMahiru: Okay!\r\n\r\nAradama: GGGIIII!\r\nMai: Tsuyuzaki-san, one of the aradama went that way! Could you get it!\r\nAradama: GGIIIII!\r\nMahiru: It's a little... Scary, but I'll do it!\r\nMahiru: EIIIIIII!!\r\nMahiru: There! Home run!\r\nMahiru: It looks like we just finished cleaning up the aradama too.\r\nMai: The aradama's really gone... You're incredible, Mahiru-san.\r\nMahiru: It sort of looked like a ball, so I just gave it a good whack on reflex.\r\nMai: That was only your reflexes...?\r\nMai: And not just that, but how you casually twirled around that weapon of yours like a baton as you fought...\r\nMai: The way you moved... I think I could use it as reference in future fights.\r\nMahiru: It's sort of embarrassing hearing you talk like that, Mai-chan.\r\nMahiru: But, would it really be helpful learning from me?\r\nMai: I'd like to give it a try. Will you teach me how?\r\nMahiru: Mmm, but even if I teach you how to twirl a baton, it's not very useful for fighting, is it? I just somehow make it work...\r\nMahiru: I know! Mai-chan, could we try training like we're really fighting?\r\nMai: Of course, if that's alright with you.\r\nMahiru: Then, let's do it over there.\r\n\r\nMahiru: I love the shining stage, but I love seeing you shine even more. I want to dance with you forever, in a duet going round and round. 99th generation, Tsuyuzaki Mahiru.\r\nMai: That line just now had such a stylish ring to it.\r\nMahiru: Ehehe, thank you. It makes me happy, hearing you say that. I get the feeling we're sort of alike, Mai-chan.\r\nMai: We're alike?\r\nMahiru: But we can talk about that after!\r\nMahiru: Fighting might be more of your specialty, but come try me, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: Here I come!\r\nMahiru: Ah, but I would appreciate it if you go a little easy on me after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/bUqlN1QeE1o\r\n[Stage Girl - Kanami: Start]: Somebody I Want to Spar With!\r\n\r\nMaya: Now then, I'll have you leave the stage. --HAAH!\r\n\r\nKaren: YAH!\r\nKaren: Nice! I beat it-.\r\n\r\nAradama: GUGGGIIIII!\r\nHikari: You won't get away-- This will finish it!\r\n\r\nKanami: These stage girls, they're all so amazing, aren't they! They fight differently from a toji, but I'm enjoying myself just watching them go!\r\nYui: Ahh... You can't help but be captivated by them, can you~.\r\nYui: Would you call it their posturing? Every one of the motions they go through grabs hold tight of my heart... It's so good!\r\nKanami: Yeah, I know just what you mean! Ahh, even if only for a little bit, I want to spar with all the stage girls!\r\nKaren: Kanami-chan, Kanami-chan, what's \"spar\" mean?\r\nKanami: Ah, sparring is when you face off... It's a practice match!\r\nKaren: A practice match, huh~. I think I might wanna have one too!\r\nFutaba: It'd be useful reference material for sword fights on stage, wouldn't it.\r\nKaoruko: Sure would. Though, I'm not about to join you.\r\nKanami: Sure! You only have to join in if you want to! I don't think it's good to force training in.\r\n\r\nHikari Slipping through my firmly raised hands, the vow we made that day fell into the abyss. I once again climb towards my stage of destiny. Even if it must end in tragedy... 99th generation, Kagura Hikari. It is all for the sake of Starlight!\r\nKanami: Wow-, being able to recite a line like that so smoothly; people training to be pros sure are something else.\r\nHikari: I am a stage girl, so this much is natural.\r\nKanami: Even still, it's pretty amazing.\r\nKanami: Oh yeah, thanks, Hikari-chan.\r\nHikari: What? Why are you thanking me suddenly?\r\nKanami: For sparring with me. I'm really happy you agreed!\r\nHikari: I just thought this experience might be useful on the stage. Are you ready?\r\nKanami: I'm ready to go anytime!\r\nHikari: Then... --YAH!\r\nKanami: That was a nice thrust, Hikari-chan! Now I'll go! HAAH!\r\nHikari: ...Kh! Then, I'll--!\r\nHikari: ...You're watching my movements closely.\r\nKanami: That's good! Show me more and more, Hikari-chan, of the way that you fight!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Stage Girl - Kanami: End]: It Is All for the Sake of Starlight!\r\n\r\nHikari: ...There-!\r\nKanami: !? That was a little risky just now!\r\nKanami: You're using the spring in your body to get even sharper with your strikes! That was a great thrust!\r\nHikari: ...You were able to dodge that just now? Toji really do have great physical performance.\r\nKanami: It's important to be able to avoid taking hits in battle, after all. That's a part of training too.\r\nHikari: Then, what will you do if I do this?\r\nKanami: Eh!? You threw your weapon!?\r\nHikari: Thank you. You deflected it just how I wanted you to.\r\nKanami: Wawah!? ...She's flying with a wire!?\r\nHikari: And now--!!\r\n\r\nKanami: Seeing that attack just now you did with the wire sent a chill up my spine-. You were right up in front of me all of a sudden.\r\nKanami: So you can fight like that too, huh!\r\nHikari: ...You blocked it so easily though.\r\nKanami: I mean, if I didn't block that right, I'd be done for. It wasn't easy for me at all.\r\nHikari: There's something I want to ask you... Why did you decide to have a match with me?\r\nKanami: Because I saw you not even flinching as you were fighting aradama, I guess.\r\nHikari: That should be the same for the other stage girls too. We all want the auditions to resume soon.\r\nKanami: You're right, but you were still a little different after all. I think it would be scary to fight with that short sword-like dagger, Hikari-chan.\r\nKanami: But still, you have a strong determination to fight. That's the feeling I got. So that's why I wanted to spar with you.\r\nHikari: ......\r\nKanami: And once we got down to it, it was super exciting!\r\nKanami: Ah! I wish I could try moving around with wires like you did, Hikari-chan-.\r\nHikari: You can't; I won't give it to you.\r\nKanami: I can't-? That's a bit of a shame!\r\nKanami: Hey. Hikari-chan, what did you think of sparring with me?\r\nHikari: Hm, real swordfighting was incredible. Teach me. Even if it's only the basic movements.\r\nKanami: Sure thing!

Just like my love for you, Mirja-san!\r\nMirja: I have no need for that.\r\nYui: Ah, but listen to this! The aradama today dropped something besides Suzudaru Cats.\r\nYui: See, look! It's like a polar bear. If any of you girls want it, don't be shy~.\r\nHikari: That's, Mr. White...!\r\nKaren: He's Hikari-chan's favorite character!\r\nYui: Well then, Hikari-san! Here's a present for you~. Treasure it like you would treasure me, okay!\r\nHikari: Th-Thank you...?\r\nMahiru: Good for you, Hikari-chan.\r\nMai: It's a real mystery why character goods are coming from the aradama, isn't it?\r\nMirja: There have been cases in the past of objects stolen by aradama dropping out of them. However... In this case, there have been no reports of these goods being stolen. Isn't that right, Hoshimi Juuna?\r\nJunna: Right. In the first place, there were no news reports of these aradama getting spotted at all.\r\nJuuna: Meanwhile they show up in this theater enough to make you sick. I wonder why?\r\nTsugumi: Some things just defy reasoning. Hmm, but it is fascinating. Isn't it, Shichinosato-san?\r\nKofuki: Who cares why this stuff happens? If aradama-chan are showing up, I'm gonna fight 'em. That's all there is to it.\r\nKaoruko: First Suzudaru Cats, now Mr. White. These aradama-han get their hands on such a variety of things, don't they?\r\nMahiru: The aradama are a little scary to look at, but they do bring us some cute presents.\r\nAradama: ......\r\nNene: Nene-ne!!\r\nHiyori: Aradama!? And it's another whole swarm of them.\r\nHikari: ...Just as we mentioned them.\r\nKaren: We can't let them get away, Hikari-chan!\r\nKofuki: Look at all the aradama-chan lining up! C'mon, show me a good time!\r\n\r\nKaren: Ahh~... I'm beat. It was a real shocker seeing that many of them show up.\r\nKaren: Do you think they came because they heard us talking about them?\r\nHiyori: I've been thinking this for a while, but... The aradama coming here might be different from the ones we usually exorcise with our okatana.\r\nYume: Actually, this whole theater is pretty weird too. What's up with this place?\r\nJuuna: On this stage, auditions are carried out that only the chosen stage girls can participate in.\r\nFutaba: Revue... To make a long story short, stage girls fight each other here. To become the top star.\r\nNana: This stage responds to the performance the singing, the dancing, the radiance of stage girls.\r\nHikari: Yes. A stage girl's radiance - their thoughts and imagination - can take all sorts of shapes here.\r\nHiyori: So then, what? You and the other stage girls... No, since we're here too, that means one of our imaginations could be creating this stage?\r\nKaoru: Maybe this is our chance to get away from the back-breaking work they put us through every day. What if everyone thinks of a world where we don't have to work?\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nYui: In that case, I'll imagine up a harem of cuties to fool around with!\r\nYui: Wait? Looking around, I'm surrounded by pretty faces-- What if I've already reached my paradise!? It's really here!\r\nJuuna: You're something else, to think about this situation that positively... I'm impressed more than anything.\r\nYui: Thank you very much! Your glasses are lovely, you know that, Juuna-san!\r\nJunna: Th-Thank you. They caught your eye, huh.\r\nAradama: ......\r\nKaoru: Again with this...? Somebody teach the aradama how to slack off already.\r\nKaoruko: Honestly, having gone along with this so far, I wouldn't mind that myself.\r\nMahiru: I thought they'd give us lots of Suzudaru Cats, but... I won't know what to do if they just keep coming~...\r\nJuuna: Come on... Do you think now's the time for this, you three!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2:\u3000Shaped Thoughts\r\n\r\nMahiru: They dropped another Suzudaru Cat.\r\nMirja: It truly is an exceptionally strange phenomenon, for the aradama that should only exist in our world to be dropping mascots from this world.\r\nMirja: However... Considering the explanation before about the strangeness of this theater, I believe we can come to one conclusion.\r\nJuuna: The aradama are a response to our thoughts too...?\r\nMirja: Yes, that's correct. The items being dropped from the aradama as well... That may be an effect of the thoughts of someone from this world.\r\nKaoruko: In that case, the culprits are plain as day. The ones causing all this ruckus could only be--\r\nKaoruko: Hikari-han and Mahiru-han!\r\nKaren: Ehh!?\r\nMahiru: A-Accusing me like that...\u3000Wh-What am I supposed to say~! You don't believe her, do you, Karen-chan? You don't think I'm the culprit, do you?\r\nHikari: I do like Mr. White, but... I didn't do it.\r\nFutaba: You don't look very convincing saying that with the doll Yui gave you before tucked between your arms.\r\nHikari: ...Ah-!?\r\nKanami: For Mahiru-chan, it's Suzudaru Cat. For Hikari-chan, it's Mr. White. If they're each created from their thoughts, then...\r\nKanami: Maybe the aradama themselves too... Maybe one of us is the source of them?\r\nHiyori: And also, creating all those aradama might take an even stronger desire than Mahiru and Hikari's...\r\nKaoru: As if. Nobody's going to be that happy about an infinite spawn of aradama...\r\nKaoru: Wait, nevermind.\r\nTojis: Ahaha...\r\nKaoruko: ...Is there really such a person?\r\nMirja: Unfortunately, there is one likely suspect. Even as we speak, she's out wandering in search of more aradama...\r\nNana: ...That bad, huh.\r\n\r\nKofuki: So you're saying, cause I'm always thinking about aradama-chan, they just keep on coming forever?\r\nKofuki: The hell; that's awesome! I get all the aradama-chan I can get my hands on!\r\nMahiru: You really do love aradama, don't you... Shichinosato-san.\r\nHikari: Mm, it's amazing.\r\nJuuna: But it would be an issue for us if we can never get the auditions to start back up again...\r\nFutaba: Hey, could you maybe just stop thinking about aradama for a while?\r\nKofuki: You might as well be asking me to drop dead, you know?\r\nKaoruko: Would it be better for Shichinosato-han to sleep until this is settled? She wouldn't be able to think of them then, would she?\r\nFutaba: What, no, how are we supposed to get her to sleep? It'd be impossible until the aradama are all defeated.\r\nKofuki: Like I could sleep when there's all these aradama-chan to play with! I'm feeling way too worked up!\r\nTsugumi: Hm, it seems we don't have a choice...\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san! Pardon me!!\r\nKofuki: MMGFGH!? Whaghre youpughng mymough... (What are you putting in my mouth...)\r\nKofuki: 0X#&$%!!?!?? (IT'S FUCKING AWFUL!!?!??)\r\nKaren: Wait, what... What happened?\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san's thoughts are giving creation to the aradama...\r\nTsugumi: With that hypothesis raised, my researcher's curiosity wanted to test it.\r\nJunna: ...And?\r\nTsugumi: I fed Shichinosato-san one of my custom made ultimate emergency rations (prototype version).\r\nJuuna: Uhh, I don't understand what that has to do with her creating the aradama though...\r\nTsugumi: You know, I don't really understand it myself, but when I had a classmate test these emergency rations, she said, \"It was so vomit inducingly horrible I passed out.\"\r\nTsugumi: Whether it's because of the taste or the ingredients, it's a forbidden food that causes loss of consciousness upon eating.\r\nKaoruko: How terrible, force feeding it to her...\r\nTsugumi: There's no need to worry. In fact, being able to offer both nutrition and sleep at once, I'm fairly proud of its remarkable efficiency.\r\nKaoruko: If that's how you prefer to put it...\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nYui: Aww, look at the adorable face Kofuki-san's making sleeping there. Makes me just want to rub her cheeks all over~!!\r\nKaoru: Oi, wouldn't it be best if we put this one to sleep too?\r\nYui: W-Wait! I can work real hard, okay! Hey, don't come near me with that dangerous stuff, Tsugumi-sannn!\r\nKaoru: Well, ignoring what it took to accomplish... The source of the aradama should now be asleep.\r\nYume: Now we won't have to fight any more of these aradama that're so annoying even though they're so weak.\r\nYomi: Yes, that should be the case.\r\nKaren: Alright, just one more push and then the auditions can restart!\r\nKanami: Yeah! We'll do all we can to help get the auditions started again right away!\r\nNana: I wasn't sure what we'd do for a while, but we're nearly there! I still have plenty of muffins left too, so feel free to have some before we fight.\r\nYume: Yaaay, thanks-. I like your muffins, Onee-san. They're good!\r\nKaoru: Maybe I should go to sleep too... I might not be able to help myself from thinking about aradama, you know.\r\nKaoru: Just to make sure.\r\nTsugumi: Well, I could use another test sample. It would be a great help if you'd eat this here emergency ration. How about it?\r\nKaoru: ...I'll pass.\r\nKaoru: Sigh... I thought it'd be a good chance to take a break too.\r\nTsugumi: That's a real shame. Oh, just in case, I'll watch over Shichinosato-san.\r\nTsugumi: If she shows signs of waking up, I'll shove another of these emergency rations down her throat.\r\nKaoru: That's just brutal... Go easy on her, will you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Approach of the Final Act\r\n\r\nAradama: ......\r\nHiyori: Kh... Their numbers aren't dropping as much as I'd hoped.\r\nClaudine: What's going on? Weren't the aradama supposed to have stopped multiplying?\r\nMaki: Maybe Shichinosato Kofuki woke up again?\r\nSuzuka: It would be good of us to confirm things with Ban-san.\r\nMaya: Yes, that would be wiser than fighting on here.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: So then you all came back to check. I see... The aradama are still appearing.\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nTsugumi: As you can tell, Shichinosato-san is fast asleep.\r\nJunna: Then, why haven't they stopped?\r\nMirja: I don't want to believe we've completely misinterpreted the cause, but... We're back where we started.\r\nKaoruko: Hang on, are you questioning my brilliant idea?\r\nFutaba: The aradama are still coming, so what else are we supposed to do?\r\nKaoru: If she's still thinking up aradama in her dreams, then we might as well call it quits.\r\nEveryone: Hmm~~~mm...\r\nYume: Hey hey, you know, if the aradama are still coming, then...\r\nYume: What if there's somebody else besides that aradama loving onee-san that's still thinking about aradama all the time?\r\nMirja: Tsubakuro Yume, that's an excellent theory.\r\nYume: Ehehe, I got a compliment~.\r\nMirja: By nature, the stage girls should not be aware of aradama. It's difficult to believe they would have any strong thoughts about aradama from our fight with them here.\r\nMirja: We should examine the possibility that another toji besides Shichinosato Kofuki would wish for aradama to appear.\r\nTsugumi: I see, I see. So the true culprit was someone else, or perhaps they were working as a pair.\r\nTsugumi: Then, based on that hypothesis, let's investigate who could be creating the aradama.\r\nTsugumi: Is there anything distinctly different about the aradama that are appearing now?\r\nKanami: Different? Hmm, I feel like they're a little tougher than the ones we were fighting before, or maybe, closer to the ones back home?\r\nKanami: Did you notice anything different, Mai-chan?\r\nMai: Eh? Umm... Well, there sure were a lot of different types of aradama now. And, looking at them, it seemed like there were practically no visual differences between them and the ones we normally fight at home.\r\nKanami: Wow, you were really paying attention! Nice going, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: Ufufu. Let's see, thinking back to them now, the aradama before Shichinosato-san went to sleep were sort of carelessly put together too. Like they were made in a frenzy...\r\nTsugumi: Hmm hmm, I see, I see. A bizarrely accurate imitation of normal aradama...\r\nTsugumi: Was there anything else?\r\nYume: There was this person shaped aradama I haven't really seen before too! It was creepy, so I made sure to chop it up~.\r\nTsugumi: Well now, a human type aradama?\r\nHiyori: Right, there was one of those too. It's movements were just bizarre. Honestly, I never want to see one of those again...\r\nFutaba: It'd make a great training partner for swordfighting scenes though.\r\nTsugumi: More than likely, that aradama is a product of Renpu's research.\r\nHiyori: What-!? You mean you're the one who made that awful thing!?\r\nTsugumi: Hey, I'm not saying that. I've only happened to see records of experiments attempting to create that type of aradama.\r\nHiyori: O-Oh... In that case, sorry I lost my temper.\r\nTsugumi: It's alright, don't let it bother you. ...Were you frightened by it?\r\nHiyori: Sh-Shut up!\r\nTsugumi: It's all coming together now... From the information we've compiled, I think I can identify the culprit.\r\nKaren: Wait, really?\r\nTsugumi: Yes, thank you for your cooperation. With the strangely accurate imitations, and the human type aradama most wouldn't be aware of...\r\nTsugumi: These clues lead us to one conclusion: the culprit behind the aradama's creation is...\r\nHikari/Karen/Kanami: Who...!?\r\nTsugumi: None other than myself!\r\nKaoru: Figures.\r\nKaoru: Cause you love them too, in a different sense. \r\nTsugumi: Well, I had a slight feeling that's what was happening too. Overly thinking about something you've been told not to think about is sadly one of humanity's bad habits.\r\nMahiru: But, you just can't help yourself from thinking about what you like, can you.\r\nKaren: Mmhm. I think about Starlight all the time!\r\nYui: Me too, me too! All I ever think about is having a good time with girls!\r\nTsugumi: Thank you for your reassurance. Anyway, I'm going to join Shichinosato-san on the other side. Good luck in dealing with the aradama.\r\nKaoru: Don't phrase it like that.\r\nTsugumi: Still... A 100% rate of imitation? Fufu, it makes me a little happy to hear that.\r\nTsugumi: Anyway, time to dig in. Chew chew...\r\nTsugumi: Ohh, it's... There's a nice crispy texture, like biting into sand... Or so it seemed, but now it's clumping into a thick mass sticking to my tongue...\r\nTsugumi: An aroma like gasoline is piercing my nostrils, pushing my senses to their limit... Feeling faint... My head is swimming...\r\nTsugumi: Snooze...\r\nMirja: ...She's asleep now.\r\nMirja: Though, listening to her comments, I cannot begin to imagine that ration's flavor. What could give her that reaction...\r\nMirja: No, as they say, curiosity killed the cat. It would be better to never know...\r\nNana: If you're going to make emergency rations, I think you should at least try making them taste nice and normal...\r\nYume: You said it-. There's no way I'm ever eating those rations!\r\nKanami: Everyone... Do your best not to think about aradama!\r\nKaren: But, when I think about not thinking, I might think about it...\r\nHikari: Then, Karen... Do you want to eat those rations too?\r\nKaren: Ehh, no wayyy. It didn't sound tasty, it was actually kinda scary!\r\nKanami: In that case, while we let them sleep, let's get rid of the aradama. As fast as we can, okay!\r\nKaren: Yeah! Let's do our best!\r\n\r\nMai: The number of aradama is definitely decreasing. We're doing it!\r\nHikari: This time for sure, the audition should be able to resume.\r\nKaoru: Yeah, if we keep this up, we should wipe all the aradama out. Though it's still a hassle.\r\nMahiru: That means we only have a short time left to spend with the toji, huh... Thinking about it like that, it's kind of sad.\r\nMai: That's true. We did have a lot of fun together.\r\nMahiru: But, that doesn't mean we can put this off any longer. We have to do what needs to be done.\r\nMai: Right. We just need a little more of your help, Tsuyuzaki-san.\r\nKaoru: Speaking of what needs to be done, before we go back to our world, someone should wake up Kofuki and Tsugumi.\r\nMirja: Yes. Though the chance may be small, if they were to remain here, it would cause a great many problems. I believe we should make sure our condition is the same as when we arrived.\r\nKaoru: Those two are dead asleep over there. It's making me jealous-.\r\nKaoru: Actually, maybe I shouldn't be... Not after they basically got knocked out cold.\r\nNene: Nene~...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkYpstF7b2U\r\n\r\n[Stage Girl: Start]: We'll Starlight!\r\n\r\nHiyori: HAAA!\r\nAradama: GYAAAA!\r\nKaren: (stare)...\r\nHiyori: Phew... Nn? What is it, Karen? Did you want something from me?\r\nKaren: Don't worry! I don't need anything, so just keep going like that!\r\nHiyori: You say that, but it's awkward with you watching me so closely...\r\nKaren: Ah, that makes sense! Then I'll just say what I'm thinking!\r\nKaren: Your swordsmanship is so pretty, Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: Wh-What!?\r\nKaren: Your movements never waver, and the way you swing your sword, it feels so dignified!\r\nKaren: How did you learn to swing your sword so pretty?\r\nHiyori: How? All I can say is, I was dedicated to my training...\r\nKaren: Then it really is all about practice, huh. I was hoping you'd say there's some trick to it.\r\nKaren: Are there any, Hiyori-chan!?\r\nHiyori: Uh... Y-Your face is too close...\r\nHiyori: Kh... In that case, why don't I let you experience it firsthand?\r\nKaren: Firsthand?\r\nHiyori: Fight with me.\r\nHiyori: It'd be easier to understand that way than me trying to explain it to you.\r\n\r\nKaren: On a stage overflowing with stardust, a flower of love blooms gracefully. Clad in a new me, I jump onto the shining stage!\r\nKaren: 99th generation, Aijou Karen! We will all Starlight!\r\nHiyori: How will we decide who wins?\r\nKaren: Whoever's cloak falls off is the loser.\r\nHiyori: Got it, simple enough.\r\nKaren: Right! ...Are you ready?\r\nHiyori: ...Yes, anytime.\r\nKaren: Okay! Then, I'll give it all I've got!\r\nHiyori: I'm not about to go easy on you either!\r\nKaren: That would be a non non!\r\nKaren: With that settled...\r\nHiyori: Let's begin!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Stage Girl: End]: Don't Forget, Okay?\r\n\r\nHiyori: A staircase...? The stage really does build up on its own.\r\nKaren: I'm not really sure how it works though! YAAAAAA!!\r\nHiyori: Hmph! Don't think you'll find an opening that easy!\r\nKaren: Whoa, you avoided that so easy!? Ahh, guess that won't work either.\r\nHiyori: Still... What's going on with this place? This strange stage we're on.\r\nKaren: What kind of stage do you want it to be, Hiyori-chan? If you think about it, I think it'll change.\r\nHiyori: For me? It's okay for me to change it too?\r\nKaren: Why wouldn't it be okay?\r\nHiyori: Hmm...\r\nKaren: ...Now's my chance! You're wide open!\r\nHiyori: No I was not! ...Still, I might as well try this out now.\r\nKaren: Chocolate mint!?\r\nHiyori: I don't believe it... It actually appeared.\r\nKaren: You like chocolate mint, Hiyori-chan? That's good for when you have to brush your teeth, huh!\r\nHiyori: I don't need it for that!\r\nKaren: Wah!? Wawawa!!\r\nHiyori: Stop dodging! Didn't you want to experience my swordsmanship!?\r\nKaren: Easy for you to say, but... Wawa!? I-I've gotta strike back... YAH!\r\nHiyori: Too slow!\r\nKaren: Uwah!?\r\nKaren: I seriously can't hit you at all!\r\nHiyori: Why do you look happy about that?\r\nKaren: Cause I get to see your pretty swordfighting up close! I'm learning a whole lot!\r\nHiyori: It's about time you showed what you're learning then.\r\nKaren: You're right... How about this!\r\nKaren: HAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nHiyori: -!? That movement, that's from when I...!\r\nKaren: Nice! I made you block me with your okatana!\r\nHiyori: Right, that attack wasn't too bad just now.\r\nKaren: Stage girls are evolving every day!  Let's do some more, Hiyori-chan!\r\n\r\nKaren: Thank you for fighting with me, Hiyori-chan! It was a whole lot of fun!\r\nHiyori: I normally have to keep someone far more persistent company, after all. I'm fine with being your opponent whenever you want.\r\nHiyori: And also, make sure not to forget the way you moved before, alright?\r\nKaren: Okay!

At last, the gate to the netherworld can be opened.\r\nKaoru: -!? Oi, look up! Something crazy's happening to the sky!\r\nMai: The sky is splitting open...\r\nSayaka: That's... the gate to the netherworld...?\r\nEllen: Wh-What do we do about that!?\r\nKanami: ...Tagitsuhime!! Give Hiyori-chan back!!\r\nTagitsu: --Hmph. Having achieved my goal, I need nothing more from you.\r\nYukari: Grh... She teleported using the leyline...!!\r\nKofuki: Oi oi... What the hell happened when we were on the way here...?\r\n\r\nSuzuka: ...Maki-san. What's happening to the sky...?\r\nMaki: I don't know either, but it doesn't look like it could be anything good.\r\nYume: Hey, hey. Are you seeing this black stuff like snow that's falling down?\r\nSuzuka: Black snow...? What is it--\r\nMaki: -!? This isn't snow! ...It's aradama!!\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAAA!\r\nYume: The snow on the ground is bunching up and turning into aradama! What the heck!\r\nMaki: Here they come! Suzuka! Yume! Be ready!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Aradama of the Netherworld (2)\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Phew... That appears to be all of them dealt with. I will say though, they felt much more formidable than the aradama we've faced so far...\r\nMaki: --You two. I received a message from Director Maniwa just now. It sounds like Tagitsuhime opened a gate to the netherworld; that thing in the sky.\r\nSuzuka: A gate to the netherworld...!! In other words, these aradama here came from the netherworld?\r\nMaki: Yeah. It's safe to assume so.\r\nYume: Then that means, we're in a state of emergency?\r\nSuzuka: That's what it means.\r\nYume: Then I'll get to show off how great I am a whole bunch, won't I? I'll try extra hard-!\r\nMaki: Sure.

What did you say just now?\r\nTagitsu: I said to leave. There is nothing more for you to do.\r\nYukina: Wh-What are you saying...? I have been nothing but loyal to you--\r\nYui: ......\r\nYukina: Wha...! Y-You brats, who do you think you're pointing those okatana at!?\r\nHana: President Takatsu, didn't you hear her? Tagitsuhime-sama told you to leave.\r\nHana: You don't have to worry. We, the imperial guard, will make sure Tagitsuhime-sama is protected from now on.\r\nTagitsuhime: ...Hmph.\r\nYukina: But... Why... Princess...?\r\nTagitsuhime: Not long now.\r\n\r\nMihono: ...I still can't believe Juujou-san got absorbed into Tagitsuhime...\r\nMirja: What's more, with the gate to the netherworld open, aradama are coming forth in droves.\r\nMirja: The JSDF have also been mobilized, along with toji from across the nation, though...\r\nKiyoka: We fought the aradama from the netherworld before, when we went to rescue Tsubakuro-san. They're so much stronger than the ones we're used to...\r\nKofuki: Things just don't get much worse than this, huh! Good thing I get to fight the aradama-chan from the netherworld!\r\nChie: Even Kofuki-chan's usually brash comments feel reassuring now.\r\nAcademy Intercom: Aradama have been sighted in the area of this academy. Toji, please prepare to sortie at once. I repeat, aradama have been sighted--\r\nKofuki: Oh-! Sounds like we're up!\r\nMirja: Everyone! Move out!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Leave (2)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Sigh...

Every since we heard about Juujou-san, you've seemed lost in your own thoughts...\r\nMihono: Ah-, sorry, Chii-nee. I was just thinking about Kanami.\r\nMihono: Right in front of Kanami's eyes, Juujou-san... It must have been really hard on her. I was just wondering, is she okay...\r\nKofuki: Like you've got time to be worrying about others right now. Instead of moping around, all we've gotta do is go beat the crap out of Tagitsuhime.\r\nKofuki: Just think of it as payback for Hiyori.\r\nMirja: We might not all be as simple as Shichinosato Kofuki, but it's important to get our emotions in order.\r\nKofuki: Huhh? You making fun of me?\r\nMirja: No, I mean it as a compliment. Being able to keep your feelings focused at a time like this is a valuable skill.\r\nYui: Ahh-! It's the girls from the investigation team-! Hooray!\r\nMihono: Yui...!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Unexpected Assault (1)\r\n\r\nYui: Has everyone in the investigation team been doing okay-?\r\nKofuki: Geh. Do we really have to deal with them again...\r\nHana: Please, you don't have to look so annoyed.\r\nYui: I'm just so happy to get to see you, Kofuki-san! You should be happier too, that we can be together again!\r\nYui: ...So then, Kiyoka-chan, gimme a big good to see you hug!\r\nKiyoka: I don't want to!\r\nKofuki: You guys are a pain in the ass. You're just gonna try stealing the noro again, aren't you?\r\nHana: Of course we are. Will you let us have that noro then, so we can offer it to Tagitsuhime-sama?\r\nChie: I can't tell you how many times we've had this exchange, but we aren't giving you anything for Tagitsuhime to use!\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui, Suzumoto Hana. I see no indication of you returning to your senses. And naturally, negotiation will be impossible. Which leaves us with...\r\nMirja: We are going to restrain the two of you here.\r\nYui: Ah! I'm gonna borrow that idea for myself! If we beat you, I'll restrain you all too, okay!\r\nYui: And then, the things I'll do to you-! We can do it all!\r\nHana: Yui. That's enough flirting with the enemy. As a platoon leader, you're setting a bad example for the others.\r\nYui: Ahaha, sorry about thaaat. In that case, let's get started! Imperial guard, charge-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Unexpected Assault (2)\r\n\r\nHana: Gh...!! The investigation team is definitely tough...!!\r\nYui: This is bad, Hana-san.

Look over there! Behind the imperial guards! That aradama that just appeared is so huge it's unreal!\r\nGreat Aradama: GUGAAAAA!!\r\nChie: This is bad...!! That's... a great aradama!?\r\nKiyoka: Wh-What should we do!? Thankfully, the people living here have finished evacuating, but...\r\nMirja: Right now, it's in our best interests to avoid fighting that aradama! We're retreating for now! We'll revise our strategy!\r\nKiyoka: Kyaa!! That great aradama, it's heading this way scarily fast!?\r\nImperial Guard A: Wh-What do we do...\r\nImperial Guard B: Nobody said something like that would show up... Tagitsuhime-sama...\r\nGreat Aradama: --GGGOOOOOOUUU!!\r\nYui: Ngghh...!! It hits so hard...!!\r\nMihono: Yui!?\r\nHana: Grh-!! ...There's nothing we can do! Imperial guard, retreat! We're leaving, Yui!\r\nYui: But, if I can beat this thing, then all that noro...!\r\nGreat Aradama: GGGAAAAAA!!\r\nYui: GYAAAAAAH-!!\r\nMihono: Yui!!\r\nYui: ...Not here... Like this...\r\nYui: ...I'm sorry, Miku...\r\nKiyoka: --NOOOOOO!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Awakening (1)\r\n\r\nChie: Yui-chan!? This can't be happening!? Say something!!\r\nKofuki: Yui!! Get up already!! You want to get run over!?\r\nKiyoka: It's no use!! She's completely lost consciousness!!\r\nMihono: We have to-- We have to save Yui, fast!!\r\nGreat Aradama: GGGAAAAOOO!!\r\nChie: It takes everything I have just to defend myself! It's attacks are too intense to get any closer!!\r\nMirja: One wrong hit would spell total defeat...\r\nMirja: If only... If only we had some means of... If we don't act quickly, Yamashiro Yui will...\r\nMihono: Yui... Why did this have to happen... I'm sorry... If I were just stronger...\r\nMihono: ............\r\nMihono: --I can't think like that!! I've gotta pull myself together!!\r\nMihono: I can't give up!! Because where there's a will, there's a way!!\r\nMihono: I'm going to save Yui, no matter what!!\r\nGreat Aradama: GGGAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: GET AWAY FROM HERRRRRRR!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Awakening (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Pant... Pant...\r\nMihono: I did it...!! We won... We won, Yui...!!\r\nMirja: I can hardly believe my eyes. She brought down that great aradama...!!\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan-- I think she's just unconscious! Please call a rescue team, quickly!\r\nKofuki: I don't really get it, but it looks like we're saved...\r\nKofuki: --!? Mihocchi! Watch out!\r\nMihono: Wagh!? What now-!?\r\nMirja: ...Tagitsuhime!!\r\nTagitsuhime: I see... I had thought I sensed a strange presence... Was it you toji then?\r\nChie: Why is she here!?\r\nMihono: I-I don't know, but this is our best chance! We have to make her give back Juujou-san!\r\nChie: Mihono-chan!?\r\nMihono: Don't worry, Chii-nee! Right now, I feel like I could take on anything! HAAAAAA-!!\r\nMihono: --Huh? She dodged it!?\r\nTagitsuhime: ...Heh.\r\nMihono: Urgh!!\r\nTagitsuhime: It seems my concern for that strangeness was misplaced. None of you are a threat to me after all.\r\nTagitsuhime: My interest is waning. I will take my leave.\r\nMihono: W-Wait...!! Give back Juujou-san...!!\r\nMihono: I don't want to see Kanami looking that sad anymore!!\r\nTagitsuhime: That has no relevance to me.\r\n\r\nMirja: Sigh...... At any rate, we were able to avoid any losses here...\r\nMihono: ...I'm sorry, Juujou-san... Sorry, Kanami... I just... If I were just stronger...\r\nChie: What are you saying? You managed to defeat that great aradama. You're just out of strength from all the fighting today. That's why-- Mihono-chan.\r\nChie: Let's bring Yui back home with us, and get lots of rest... After that, we can all think together of some way to stop Tagitsuhime, okay?\r\nMihono: .........Okay.\r\nMirja: What happened with Kashuu Kiyomitsu... Was that Asakura Mihono's power...? Or rather...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: A Place I Must Go (1)\r\n\r\nElsewhere, at that time--\r\n\r\nYomi: Nn.....\r\nYomi: Where am I...? ............\r\nYomi: For how long was I unconscious...?\r\nYomi: .........I have to hurry, back to her...\r\nYomi: ......! Aradama......!\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAA!\r\nYomi: Just...\r\nYomi: Stay out of my way...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: A Place I Must Go (2)\r\n\r\nYomi: Pant... Pant... I can... Still...\r\nYomi: I'll make it to her... Without fail... Urgh...\r\n\r\nKofuki: You know, you were pretty crazy back there, Mihocchi, when you were fighting that great aradama. What was up with that anyway?\r\nMihono: I dunno either! But I think, Kiyomitsu was probably trying to help me save Yui! Thanks, Kiyomitsu!\r\nMirja: Some things defy explanation. When we find a calm moment, I would certainly like to research Kashuu Kiyomitsu in depth.\r\nKiyoka: By the way... What's going to happen with Yui-chan now...?\r\nChie: The rescue team should be here to recover her any minute. But, after that...\r\nChie: After she wakes up, she might try to return to the imperial guard, so she'll need to be placed under arrest...\r\nMirja: Excuse the interruption, everyone. President Souraku is calling. I will put her on speakerphone.\r\nYuzuki: I heard the report. You've secured Yamashiro Yui, haven't you.\r\nYuzuki: --Do you have the ampoule I left with you there now?\r\nMirja: Yes, I have it on hand. Our conversation was cut off, so I never had the chance to ask you, what is in this ampoule?\r\nYuzuki: .........To put it simply, you could think of it as... a cure for the imperial guard's strengthening drugs.\r\nYuzuki: If you apply that to Yamashiro Yui, it should be capable of dispelling the brainwashing effect Tagitsuhime has on her.\r\nKiyoka: Will it really!?\r\nYuzuki: However, it comes with its own risk. And a grave risk at that. The truth is, that ampoule belonged to the elite guard...\r\nYuzuki: It's the strengthening drug once used by Shidou and Konohana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: Yui's Resolve\r\n\r\nMirja: A strengthing drug for the elite guard... you mean?\r\nYuzuki: That's correct. Though, it may be hard to consider this a cure.\r\nYuzuki: It's nothing more than an even stronger drug than the ones Yamashiro Yui was given in the imperial guard, which should soon overwrite Tagitsuhime's affect on her mind.\r\nYuzuki: However, rather than curing her, using that ampoule will deepen the effects of the noro in Yamashiro Yui's body.\r\nChie: But then... Even if it would remove the brainwashing, that's just...\r\nKiyoka: Tsubakuro-san was in a lot of pain because of the noro inside her body, wasn't she...\r\nChie: Not just Tsubakuro-san. Shidou-san, and Konohana-san too...\r\nChie: And they said Satsuki-san was summoning aradama at the cost of her own life.\r\nKofuki: Still, the tradeoff is the elite guard got stronger, didn't they?\r\nChie: As far as I'm concerned, I can't think that that was worth it...\r\nMirja: Should we inject Yamashiro Yui with this ampoule, or... Under normal circumstances, this is something Yamashiro Yui should decide for herself, but...\r\nKiyoka: ...I don't think we should! I don't think Yui should have any more noro than she already does!\r\nChie: I'm against it as well. We need to let Yui-chan rest for a while, and wait to find some other way to help her.\r\nMirja: But, which method will cause Yamashiro Yui the least amount of suffering...\r\nMihono: Mirja-san...\r\nMirja: ...Asakura Mihono, please give me your point of view.\r\nMihono: Yeah, okay. I think--\r\nYui: ......Wait!\r\nMihono: Ah, Yui...\r\nMirja: --Yamashiro Yui! What are you doing!?\r\nYui: --UAAAAGGHH!! RGHHGH!!\r\nYui: AGH... AHHH... GGH, MY B-BODY... AGHH, IT'S BURNING...!!\r\nMirja: Why would you be so reckless...!? That's the strengthening drug for the elite guard, you know!!\r\nYui: ...I, I heard, everything... you said...!!\r\nYui: But, there's something... I have to do!\r\nYui: With me, like that, Miku would never... be happy!!\r\nYui: There's no point, if I won't be me! Whatever price, I have to pay!!\r\nYui: --GGAAAAHH!! AAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGHHHH!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: Mirja's Proposal\r\n\r\nSana: Hmm... I see. That's not a bad idea.\r\nMirja: For such a storied okatana, the Sword Administration Bureau must have some form of records...\r\nSana: I got it. Give it a shot. I'll tell the reference room to lend you a hand.\r\nSana: And you're not going to get that far researching on your own. I'll allow you to bring one member of the investigation team along. Who you pick is up to you.\r\nMirja: Thank you very much.\r\nSana: Phew... Leave it to the captain of the investigation team to come up with a proposal like this.\r\nSana: It's the primary mission of your investigation team, after all.\r\nMirja: That's true."}, {"paste_key": "QHkYry09", "title": "Out of Season Cherry Blossom Front", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/QHkYry09", "timestamp": "", "hits": "203", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq7ugG3Z_Xw\r\n\r\nOut of Season Cherry Blossom Front: Prologue\r\n\r\nKanami: Hey, did all of you see? The flower buds on the cherry blossom trees behind the school are getting bigger!\r\nHiyori: I know. I saw it myself earlier. The weather report said the temperature should go up this weekend, and then they'll bloom.\r\nMai: We should go see them together after they start blooming.\r\nSayaka: Okay. If Mai is going, I will too...\r\nChie: In that case, why don't we all organize a flower viewing party? I've been talking with Mihono-chan and the others about it.\r\nKanami: All of us going flower viewing!? That sounds like fun~!\r\nHiyori: That's true... Going with a large group of people could be nice too.\r\nChie: I'm glad to hear it. We'd have a hard time getting bentos ready for everyone, so we talked about buying what we liked from a nearby deli. If there's anything you want to eat, just tell me, okay?\r\nMai: Um, if it's alright, would you mind if I made everyone bento boxes? I'll come up with a menu to excite everyone when we're all seeing the flowers together.\r\nHiyori: If we're making a flower viewing bento, we'll have to include nimono. I want to be in charge of helping make the food as well.\r\nChie: Oh my, that would be such a great help, you two!\r\nSayaka: Mai's homemade bento... I can't wait. I'll do my best to prepare too...\r\nKanami: Yeah. Let's work hard on the preparations together, Sayaka-chan! Aside from the bento boxes, what do we need to get ready...\r\nChie: Well, we could use people in charge of reserving a good location, and people in charge of finding ways to liven up the party.\r\nSayaka: I understand. I'll do my best... To find a good location...\r\nKanami: And I'll help!\r\nChie: Then, I'll think something up with Ellen-san, Kiyoka-chan, and the others to liven up the event, and lend a hand to the girls making bento boxes on the side.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the flower viewing--\r\n\r\nChie: How are things going, you two? Is there anything I could help you with?\r\nMai: All that's left is to fill the boxes, so we should be fine.\r\nHiyori: I tried cutting the carrots in the nimono into shapes to match the cherry blossoms. Want to try some?\r\nSayaka: ...Mai.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan, you came at just the right time! We were just finishing up with the bento boxes.\r\nMai: Would you like to have a little taste test?\r\nSayaka: I can't eat the bento.\r\nMai: Eh!? Wh-What do you mean, Sayaka-chan!? But, you were looking forward to it so much, weren't you...?\r\nMai: Did you get a stomachache!?\r\nChie: Calm down, Yanase-san. Itomi-san, do you think you could tell me why you can't eat the bento?\r\nSayaka: There's no cherry blossoms.\r\nChie/Mai: Eh?\r\n\r\nHiyori: Well, there sure aren't any flowers. Weren't they supposed to be in full bloom today?\r\nChie: Itomi-san, I don't see Mihono-chan and the others anywhere. Did they go to look for another location?\r\nSayaka: Mm. They said they wanted to eat the bento boxes where we could see the cherry blossoms.\r\nMai: I want to eat under the cherry blossoms with everyone too!\r\nChie: It would spoil the mood if there weren't any flowers, wouldn't it. Maybe we should also...\r\nAradama: KEEEEEE!\r\nHiyori: An aradama!? SEYAAAAH!!\r\nHiyori: That's it taken care of.\r\nSayaka: Hm...? Look... The branch of that tree...\r\nChie: I don't believe it; the buds of the flowers are opening!\r\nMai: But why!?\r\nTsugumi: I see you're all here too.\r\nTsugumi: It appears that, when an aradama is suppressed, a grouping of cherry blossoms comes into bloom.\r\nTsugumi: I'm not sure of the reason behind it, but it is a highly fascinating phenomenon.\r\nSayaka: Tsugumi, that means...\r\nSayaka: Our spring was stolen, by aradama?\r\nTsugumi: Ooh... Spring was stolen...?\r\nMai: Ah! Sayaka-chan, that sounded so poetic! What a lovely expression!\r\nSayaka: Is it wrong?\r\nTsugumi: No... There's nothing wrong with that interpretation of it. The aradama went and stole our spring!!\r\nSayaka: ...Then, for every aradama we defeat, it will bring back that many flowers?\r\nTsugumi: That seems to be the case.\r\nTsugumi: But, well, to make the flowers bloom across this entire area could take some back-breaking work.\r\nMai: ...Still, let's do it.\r\nMai: Let's defeat the aradama, Chie-san! Until all the flowers here are in bloom!\r\nChie: Of course! I'll do what I can, so we can all have our flower viewing party!\r\nHiyori: Good, then let's defeat as many aradama as possible, and bring back our spring!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of Season Cherry Blossom Front: Epilogue\r\n\r\nSayaka: Oh, Mai and everyone came...\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan, Mai-chan, over here, over here~!\r\nMihono: Hurry up, Chii-nee~!\r\nHiyori: It's beautiful... Everything is in full bloom.\r\nMai: Thank you for finding us such a fantastic place, Sayaka-chan, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: The other people who came to see the flowers offered us the best spot, to thank us for exorcising the aradama.\r\nChie: Did they really? It was worth going to so much trouble then.\r\nMihono: Ah~, all that hard work suppressing aradama made me hungry~. Let's dig right into Mai and Juujou-san's special made flower viewing bento!\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono, we cannot get ahead of ourselves. The proper procedure of a flower viewing party is to first admire the cherry blossoms, then share a toast. After that, we admire the cherry blossoms again, then it will be time to eat.\r\nKofuki: Then let's hurry this up and get to the toast already. My throats dried out from all that playing around with aradama-chan.\r\nTsugumi: I thought this might happen, so I planned ahead and prepared a special flower viewing version of a drink to stimulate recovery after combat.\r\nKiyoka: A-And did you make that drink yourself, Tsugumi-san...?\r\nTsugumi: Yes. Using amazake as a base, I supplemented it with various spices and ingredients to prepare for an outdoor party during this chilly time of year.\r\nChie: I think I won't be needing a drink after all.\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah, me too...\r\nTsugumi: Are you sure? I even adjusted the color so it would match the cherry blossoms...\r\nSayaka: It looks pretty... Tsugumi, I think... I'll drink some...\r\nHiyori: I'll try it too. I wouldn't want the work you put into getting it ready for our flower viewing party to go to waste.\r\nEllen: It is a party, after all. Hm...? Tsugumin, where did the bottle of your drink go?\r\nKaoru: Oi, Yui, that bottle you're chugging down...\r\nYui: Glug, glug, glug... Phwaah~! I can't tell if that tasted good or bad, but give me another one!\r\nSayaka: Yui... Did you drink the whole bottle?\r\nHiyori: She said it's supposed to help with recovery, but would it really be safe drinking that much?\r\nYui: When I started drinking it down, I just couldn't stop myself. Actually, what's with this stuff!? My body's burning up all of a sudden!\r\nTsugumi: I see, if you drink that much at once, the body rapidly begins to warm itself... I've gained some unexpectedly useful data from this.\r\nYui: Ahh~, everything's warm and fuzzy, like it's the middle of summer! I just want to leave my uniform behind, throw on a swimsuit, and hop in the sea-!\r\nYui: Ah... What if, if everyone drinks this, then you'll all start heating up, and we can have our flower viewing party in swimsuits!?\r\nMirja: What a corrupt line of thinking...\r\nYui: I found another bottle! Here, Sayaka-chan, Hiyori-chan, take a good long gulp of this! Come on, open wide!\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan, you're like an old man coming up to bother young girls in the park...\r\nYui: C'mon, c'mon! Have a drink~! Have a drink~!\r\nSayaka: Yui... You're scaring me... I... Don't want any...\r\nHiyori: Yeah, I'm saying no too.\r\nYui: Ehh~, that's so boring~. Then, I'm gonna walk around over there and see if there's any pretty ladies I can offer a drink!\r\nYui: Hey! Hey you, miss! Want to enjoy a hot time under the cherry blossoms with me!\r\nChie: It seems Yui-chan has skipped right over spring and gone into summer... But the rest of us can start our flower viewing party now.\r\nHiyori: Right. It feels good to have spring back to normal. So, is everyone ready to do our toast?\r\nHiyori: Since you organized all this, you should lead the toast, Chie.\r\nChie: Alright then.\r\nChie: ...No, actually, why don't we let Itomi-san lead us?\r\nSayaka: I'm doing it?\r\nChie: You worked very hard, didn't you? That's why, I'd like to ask you to do it.\r\nSayaka: I understand, I'll do my best... Should I start?\r\nMai: Sure, we're all ready.\r\nSayaka: ...I'm glad we could all see the flowers. Cheers.\r\nEveryone: Cheers!!"}, {"paste_key": "r18gFVx1", "title": "Chinese Pandas Bringing Good Fortune", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/r18gFVx1", "timestamp": "", "hits": "83", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4I637bOB2U\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Wuef7y1z6Q4\r\n\r\n1: Searching for Pandas in Chinatown\r\n\r\nMihono: So this is Chinatown~! It's amazing! The streets don't even look like Japan anymore!\r\nTsugumi: It's been a while since I came here, but it's always so busy that it looks as if it's in the middle of a festival.\r\nYui: There's cute girls all around, so I'm feeling the excitement!\r\nMihono: Thanks for coming along with me on your day off, you two.\r\nYui: I should be thanking you, Mihono-chan, for inviting me on a Chinatown date with you and Tsugumi-san. My heart won't stop racing!\r\nTsugumi: I'm looking forward to seeing all sorts of unusual things here as well.\r\nMihono: That's good to hear. Then, let's get started on our main objective in coming here today.\r\nTsugumi: Main objective? Which would be...\r\nMihono: I was watching TV the other day, and they said, here in Chinatown, there's these Chinese dressed panda dolls that are super popular right now!\r\nYui: Ah-, I heard about those too! The ones that all the girls are collecting, right?\r\nMihono: They're cute enough just to look at, but that's not all! Apparently they're also lucky item that brings you happiness!\r\nTsugumi: I see, so there's some link between the dolls and good fortune... I'd be interested in seeing more data on that.\r\nYui: I don't know about the data, but if cute girls are into them, I want to get one. It might come in handy in the future.\r\nTsugumi: So, do you know where in Chinatown they might be selling these dolls?\r\nMihono: They're a huge fad right now, so they said on TV that any place selling souvenirs should have them.\r\nYui: Though, I don't see any on display in the stores around here.\r\nTsugumi: Perhaps the special feature on TV caused their popularity to skyrocket and they sold out.\r\nMihono: No way... But still, there's so many shops around here, so one of them has to be selling them! We just have to look hard enough and... Huh?\r\nMihono: Hey, you two~, where'd you go?\r\nYui: Uhyaa-! The girls walking around Chinatown give Harajuku a run for its money! I might've found a nice secret spot to go girl watching!\r\nMihono: Yui! We can go girl watching later, but what about the pandas...?\r\nYui: Whoops, sorry. When girls this pretty go walking by, I can't help myself from following them.\r\nYui: But don't you worry! You and Tsugumi-san are my honeys today!\r\nMihono: O-Okay. Thanks.\r\nYui: So come on, honey, let's go find you what you wanted! ...Wait? Where's Tsugumi-san?\r\nMihono: She was gone before I knew it...\r\nMihono: ...Wait!? Over in front of that shady looking shop...\r\nTsugumi: A Chinese herbal medicine store, operating for generations here in Chinatown... The product of four thousand years of Chinese efforts could prove useful in bolstering toji's abilities...\r\nYui: She looks like she's having a good time, so maybe we should leave her be...\r\nTsugumi: Ah-- I'm sorry. We were going to help Asakura-san with her shopping first, weren't we. I should have been more mindful...\r\nTsugumi: Still, none of the souvenir shops we've seen have been selling them, have they?\r\nMihono: Uuuu... I wonder why.\r\nYui: Don't lose hope yet! Maybe they have a still have a ton of them in the back! We should ask the shopkeeper! Excuse me!\r\nMihono: We were looking for the pandas wearing Chinese clothes that were on TV the other day.\r\nShopkeeper: Sorry, but to tell the truth, aradama showed up here in Chinatown this morning, and...\r\nMihono: Don't tell me... They stole the pandas!?\r\nShopkeeper: Mmm, not so much as stole them, but... They went rampaging around and the pandas got caught up in them?\r\nTsugumi: I see. There are an endless amount of forms an aradama can take. Many of them could easily ensnare an object by accident.\r\nMihono: Whoa whoa wait, no matter how easy it would be, wouldn't it be weird for all the pandas to get grabbed like that!? Don't you think the aradama are stealing them after all!\r\nTsugumi: If that's the case... There is a high possibility these aradama have caught onto the fad and are all collecting the dolls.\r\nMihono: Okay okay okay, Chinatown's pandas are just so popular, even in the netherworld, that there's just not enough for everyone~ like I'm gonna be happy with thaaaat!!\r\nMihono: And we just came all the way out to Chinatown to buy them too-, dangiiit!!\r\nYui: Hnng, Mihono-chan's so cute when she's frustrated! But I bet you'd look even cuter hugging a panda all happy... Alright, we can go get them back together!\r\nTsugumi: I'll join you. We might come to understand why the aradama are so fascinated by these dolls. Let's leave at once.\r\nMihono: You guys... Thank you! With us together, we won't leave a single panda behind!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Where are Chinatown's Best Meat Buns At?\r\n\r\nMihono: Phew, we finally got a Chinese panda! Look how cute it is~!\r\nYui: Nnn~, Mihono-chan's so cute with her panda~! I want a video of this I can put on an infinite loop!\r\nTsugumi: I hate to spoil such a happy moment, but many more dolls still need to be recovered. Why don't we return that to the store for now and continue suppressing aradama?\r\nMihono: That's right... Uuu, Chinese panda-chan... We'll meet again, okay... I'll come get you for sure, I mean it...\r\nYui: You just have to think positive, Mihono-chan. Once we get all of them back, we can buy as many as we want!\r\nMihono: Oh yeah. Let's do our best then, and beat all the aradama!\r\nMihono: Uh... That reminds me, since I thought we were going to eat a lot in Chinatown, I skipped breakfast.\r\nTsugumi: They say you can't fight on an empty stomach. Why don't we find something to replenish our energy while we wait for the next aradama to show itself?\r\nYui: I'm all for it~. There's so many tasty looking things around here, so what should we go with-?\r\nMihono: Since we're here in Chinatown, we have to at least try some meat buns!\r\nMihono: I saw on TV, there's this meat bun store here that's supposed to have the most delicious meat buns, and they looked super yummy too! Can we go there?\r\nYui: That sounds good. What's the name of the place? Do you know where it is?\r\nMihono: Umm... I completely forgot! Uuu... Sorry.\r\nTsugumi: If the store is popular, there should be a line for it, shouldn't there? Why don't we look for a place selling meat buns with a line out front.\r\nYui: Smart thinking, Tsugumi-san! But it'd help if we had any other hints. Mihono-chan, was there anything else you remember about that store?\r\nMihono: I remember there was so much meat that the juices were all spilling out...\r\nYui: Sounds delicious! So we're looking for a popular store with a line out front selling juicy meat.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: You know, the smells coming from any one of these stores are tantalizing enough to work up my appetite.\r\nYui: At this point, I think I'd be fine getting meat buns from anywhere.\r\nMihono: Just hang in there! Since we're looking for it anyway, we might as well find the number 1 tastiest meat buns! All full of meat, and dripping with juices. I just know you won't regret it!\r\nMihono: Sniff, sniff, sniff... Ah, how about that place...\r\nMihono: Yui, Tsugumi-san! This is it! We're here-!\r\nTsugumi: Seems we've found it at last. Let's go join her!\r\n\r\nMihono: Check it out, you two! In this bamboo steamer! All full of meat; in fact, it's mostly just meat! It's amazing!\r\nYui: Mm~, it smells so good! I think I'll take a peek in there too. Let's see... Wait, Mihono-chan!\r\nTsugumi: This is...\r\nMihono: Huh? What's up?\r\nYui: Yeah, this is full of meat, but...\r\nTsugumi: Asakura-san, these are different kind of dumpling called shumai.\r\nMihono: Ah-! They are-! I got so focused on finding meat that I forgot all about looking for meat buns!\r\nYui: Really, what are we going to do with you, Mihono-chan? Though that clumsy side of yours is so cute too!\r\nMihono: Uuu... Sorry I got your hopes up.\r\nTsugumi: There's no need to apologize. These may not be meat buns, but take a look at their sign. It says they serve the best shumai in Chinatown.\r\nYui: ...Wait? The shop next door has a huge line too. It looks like they're selling meat buns...\r\nMihono: Ah-! That's the place! The one on TV! That's crazy; we found two of Chinatown's best right next to each other! It's our lucky day!\r\nMihono: Why don't we take this chance to try both of them out! Ahh~, I'm so glad we kept on searching~.\r\nAradama: Keeeeeee!\r\nMihono: An aradama!? Geez, why'd you have to show up now!\r\nTsugumi: It may be frustrating, but we can enjoy the shumai and meat buns after we finish fighting.\r\nMihono: Grrh... You're gonna pay for this, you aradama! C'mon, let's go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Secret Behind Chinatown's Alluring Sweets is...!?\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Nicely done, you two. There should only be a small number of aradama left for us to defeat.\r\nYui: I wonder when the next'll show up. It'd be nice if they all came at once so we could finish it all up.\r\nMihono: They probably won't be here right away, so let's go back to where they were selling meat buns and shumai! My tummy's rumbling~.\r\n\r\nMihono: Oh no...\r\nYui: \"Sold out, closed for the day.\"\r\nTsugumi: They must have sold out while we were suppressing the aradama. What now? Should we find another store?\r\nMihono: Uuuu... We finally the place they were calling Chinatown's best too...\r\nYui: Hang in there, Mihono-chan. Chinatown has more number 1s than just meat buns and shumai.\r\nYui: Ta-dahh! Look what I've got! One of Kiyoka-chan's magazines had a special feature on Chinatown, so I borrowed it!\r\nMihono: Whoa~, all the food in here looks so tasty! Oh, there's a tapioca juice shop. It says it gets the longest lines in Chinatown; we should go check it out!\r\nTsugumi: That sounds like a good idea. The sugar will quickly convert into energy, so it's optimal for a pre-fight meal.\r\n\r\nYui: Hmmm, it looks like the tapioca shop should be straight down this street.\r\nMihono: Ah-, look! That looo~ng line, maybe that's...\r\nTsugumi: It seems to be the store from the magazine, doesn't it.\r\nYui: Uhyaa-! Look at all the cuties waiting in line! We've gotta line up next to them!\r\nMihono: Okay!\r\nTsugumi: I went and got their menu. What should we buy?\r\nMihono: Look at all the flavors besides milk tea! Wow, I can't make up my mind~!\r\nYui: They all sound tasty, but... What do they make tapioca with, anyway? It's all round and squishy.\r\nMihono: Huh, I never thought about it. I don't know.\r\nTsugumi: They closely resemble frog eggs, don't they? In early spring, you can find them bunched up around ponds and riversides...\r\nMihono: Gehh... Now that you said it, I think I see it too...\r\nTsugumi: Actually, I've handled both of them before, and it isn't just their appearance that's alike. They feel very similar to the touch as well. You know, it is spring now, so it wouldn't surprise me if...\r\nMihono: Ehh-, I don't think I can do this!\r\nYui: Hey, hang on, Mihono-chan! Where are you going-? We're almost to the front of the line-!\r\nMihono: I can't eat frogs~!\r\nTsugumi: I may have teased her too far. She's long gone.\r\n\r\nMihono: Ahh, I can't believe it... All this time, I never thought about it, but the yummy tapioca I've been eating was actually...\r\nTsugumi: Finally, there you are. I'm sorry about before, Asakura-san. I only meant it as a joke, but I didn't expect you to believe me...\r\nMihono: Eh? A joke? Then...\r\nTsugumi: Tapioca is made from starch extracted from a tuber that grows in southern countries. They roll it into round shapes and then boil it. None of its ingredients involve frogs in any way.\r\nMihono: Wait, really~? If I'd have known that, I would've never left the line~!\r\nTsugumi: I thought you might feel that way, so I left Yamashiro-san keeping our place in line. We were nearly at the front, so let's go back and buy our drinks.\r\nMihono: Really!? What a relief~! Thanks so much, Tsugumi-san!\r\n\r\nYui: Welcome back, you two~! You came just in time for us to order.\r\nMihono: Thanks, Yui!\r\nMihono: What should I go with~? Okay, I made up my mind! I'll have...\r\nAradama: Keeeeeee!\r\nMihono: EHHHHH!? Why'd you have to show up right now-!?\r\nTsugumi: First the pandas, then the meat buns, then the tapioca. It seems our target aradama are sensitive to trends after all...\r\nMihono: Arghh-! Let's just get this over with!!\r\nTsugumi: Of course, of course. Let's proceed then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Where's Our Lucky Break...?\r\n\r\nMihono: Haa~, we've gotten rid of all the aradama, and gotten all the pandas back. Now our mission's complete, right!\r\nTsugumi: We've worked hard. Now we can enjoy the sights of Chinatown at last.\r\nYui: For now, why don't we go back to that tapioca store we almost got to try?\r\nMihono: Yeah, let's go back!\r\n\r\nMihono: Oh no...\r\nYui: You've gotta be kidding. They closed the shutters...\r\nTsugumi: The magazine says, \"They close as soon as they run out of stock.\"\r\nMihono: Uuuu... First the meat buns, and now the tapioca...\r\nYui: Hey now, cheer up, Mihono-chan! I know you were looking forward to trying the different foods, but we still took care of your main goal today; we got the Chinese pandas, didn't we?\r\nMihono: We did! After all our hard work, we got them all back. We should go pick up some for ourselves before they run out!\r\nTsugumi: She sure took off in a hurry.\r\nYui: Well, she did want to come to Chinatown and fight those aradama all for the pandas. We'd better catch up.\r\nYui: Wait for us-!\r\n\r\nMihono: Uuuuu...\r\nTsugumi: What's wrong? You look disappointed. Don't tell me...\r\nMihono: They're all sold out of pandas...\r\nYui: Ehh-!? But we got so many of them back though?\r\nMihono: They said news that the lucky pandas were getting returned from the aradama spread all over the web, and they sold out instantly...\r\nMihono: Even though the whole reason I came to Chinatown was to get those pandas...\r\nYui: It's not the end of the world, Mihono-chan. If you can't get a Chinese panda of your own, then I'll put on a China dress and you can hug me all you want!\r\nTsugumi: While making it seem like you're cheering someone up, you move straight into skinship. You're a natural, Yamashiro-san.\r\nMihono: Yui... I'll be fine. Just... Uuuu... My pandas-!!\r\nShopping District Helper: Excuse me, are you girls the toji who cleaned out the aradama just now?\r\nTsugumi: Yes, that would be us. Is there something you needed?\r\nShopping District Helper: I've been looking all over for you, to reward you for bringing our valuable merchandise back.\r\nYui: Eh, a reward!? Like what? Something like a full course meal of high class Chinese food?\r\nShopping District Helper: Sorry, would you have preferred something like that? I heard you were young girls, so I only have these for you...\r\nMihono: Ehhhh---!? Chinese pandas, and three of them!!\r\nTsugumi: But weren't they all sold out from every store?\r\nShopping District Helper: We wanted to be sure to give something back to the toji who defeated the aradama, so everyone in the shopping district made sure to leave enough for the three of you.\r\nShopping District Helper: This is our show of appreciation, so please, by all means, take them.\r\nMihono: Thanks so much! Wow~, I finally got one~!! It's so cute~!\r\nTsugumi: Wasn't that nice of them, Asakura-san. Now you've accomplished your starting goal.\r\nYui: With these pandas, plenty of good things are sure to happen from now on!\r\nMihono: Yeah! Good things'll happen for sure! I can't wait~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Wuef7y1z6Q4\r\n[China - Yui: Start]: The Chinatown Date I've Longed For!?\r\n\r\nTsugumi: We've safely eliminated the aradama, so while we're here, why don't we take a stroll around Chinatown until the sun starts setting?\r\nMihono: I'm all for it~! There's still a lot more shops I haven't been to yet. Do you two wanna come with me?\r\nYui: Of course I do!\u3000It's a Chinatown date with two good looking girls at my side! This makes fighting off those aradama all worth it~.\r\nYui: Date~! Date~! Chinatown date~!\r\nMihono: You're sure in a good mood, Yui.\r\nYui: You know I am! Taking a beauty like you on a date through Chinatown; that's the kind of classic date course I've been dreaming of!\r\nTsugumi: ...\r\nYui: Hm? What's up, Tsugumi-san? Ah-- Don't tell me, you're getting jealous I'm giving Mihono-chan all the attention?\r\nTsugumi: No, not once this whole time have I ever felt anything like that...\r\nYui: Then, what's that uneasy look on your face for?\r\nTsugumi: Sorry, it might be senseless of me to ask, but... I was just wondering, what is the definition of a \"date\" to begin with?\r\nYui: Tsugumi-san, you're such a serious going girl. When it comes to things like this, it's all about \"Don't think; feel!\"\r\nTsugumi: Go with your feelings without thinking... Is that it. Then, coming up with feelings regarding dating... How exactly do you do that?\r\nYui: That's easy! Right now, I'll swap between taking you and Mihono-chan on a Chinatown date with me, to give you the dating experience!\r\nMihono: The dating experience?\r\nYui: Yeah! I've spent a lot of time mentally rehearsing for the ultimate heart-pounding Chinatown date, so I'll show you a good time for sure!\r\nTsugumi: If you're that sure then, Yamashiro-san... It might not be so bad to get an experience of the real thing.\r\nYui: That's the spirit! So then, to start us off... I think I'll take out Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Ehh-- Starting with me!? If you just tell me we're going on a date like that, I don't have time to get my heart ready...\r\nYui: Don't you worry about that, Honey. I'll escort you around just right. Why don't we find somewhere to get some delicious sweets first?\r\n\r\nYui: This place sells the apricot seed soft serve that's the talk of Chinatown! I don't have much pocket money on me today, so let's share one between us. Here, open wide.\r\nMihono: Ahhn. [chew chew]... It's yummy-!!\r\nYui: Alright, now it's your turn, Mihono-chan! I'll say \"ahh\", and you...\r\nMihono: Ah, look, look! In that general store next door! They've got cute panda things you can wear!\r\nYui: Ah, wait, Mihono-chaaan!\r\nMihono: Tadahhh! Check it out! See this panda hat I got! Does it look good?\r\nYui: Mmm~! It's good; so good~! Next up, let's try this Chinese hat~! Uwah~! This one looks good too~.\r\nTsugumi: ...\r\nTsugumi: Um, would it be alright if we stopped for a moment?\r\nYui: Hmmm? What's the matter, Tsugumi-san? Hahahn~, now are you feeling jealous of me with Mihono-chan...\r\nTsugumi: That's not it. It's just that, I've started to have my doubts about all this. Eating sweets together, and excitedly shopping. It's true that it does seem like you two are having lots of fun, but...\r\nTsugumi: It also seems as if nothing has changed from when the three of us were going around together before. Can you really call this an example of a date...?\r\nMihono: You're right. It was a lot of fun, but if I had to say either way, this isn't any different from everyone hanging out together, is it-?\r\nTsugumi: Yamashiro-san, is it really fine to classify this under the definition of a date?\r\nYui: Uuu~, when you put it like that, I'm losing confidence. Could I have a little time to think this over?\r\nYui: Get ahold of yourself, Yui. Remember the strongest Chinatown fantasy date plan you fantasized about over and over day after day. Chinatown... Chinatown... When I think of an ideal date in Chinatown, it's gotta be...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[China - Yui: End]: A Practice Run!? Yui's Fantasy Chinatown Date!\r\n\r\nYui: Chinatown date... Chinatown date... When I think of situations for the Chinatown date I've been dreaming of, there's...\r\nYui: That'll do~!!!!!\r\nMihono: You look like a lightbulb went off in your head, Yui.\r\nTsugumi: She does. And, it's somewhat unsettling...\r\nYui: Anyway, let's get back into it, and swap partners! I'll need you to be play my girlfriend now, Tsugumi-san!\r\nTsugumi: (Sigh, of course it would come to this. Though, I was the one who asked what a date was to start, so I can't back out now, can I...)\r\nTsugumi: Understood. Then, please go easy on me.\r\nYui: Just leave that to me! Anyway, let's start right off by holding hands! [squeeze~]. Woww, Tsugumi-san, your hands are so soft and warm~!\r\nTsugumi: Y-Yamashiro-san! What are you doing? You got too close all of a sudden!\r\nYui: See, I remembered. When you think of a date, it means the two of you are closer than friends! That means, the two of us need to have a closeness deeper than friendship.\r\nTsugumi: Deeper than friendship... Is that so.\r\nYui: That's right! For example, if, while everyone's watching, I gave you a deep kiss!\r\nYui: And then, and then, if I took you someplace where no one's around, like a park or back alley, and when it's just the two of us, we... Ehehe... Ehehe...\r\nTsugumi: I-Is that what it means...  I think I understand the gist of it now, so don't you think we can end our fake date here?\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah. I think so too... The sun's going to go down soon too, so why don't we head home for today...\r\nYui: Ehh-, just hang on! We were only just getting started-!\r\nYui: Uuuu... Just when it was looking like we were going to get into the juicy stuff; I'm such an idiot! I should have way more stuff in my stock of fantasies that'll make girl's hearts pound-!\r\nYui: Ah-! I know! I have the strongest Chinatown date plan in history here! Hey, you two-, wait for me-!\r\nYui: I thought up the strongest Chinatown date plan! So please! Will you at least hear me walk you through it? If this doesn't make your hearts throb, then I'll take this as my loss!\r\nTsugumi: We weren't competing to see if you won or lost in the first place... But, if you're that adamant about it, we can at least hear you out.\r\nMihono: Yeah. It's fine if you're only going to talk... And plus, I'm a little curious what the strongest date plan is like!\r\nYui: Thanks so much, you two! It's that kind side of you that I love so much! Anyway, I'll get right to my presentation!\r\nYui: Our date starts off at a China dress shop in Chinatown! We put on matching dresses, and head out on the town!\r\nTsugumi: Matching China dresses... We're sticking to the assumption that this is a same sex female couple then...\r\nMihono: Still, this sounds exciting! You'd be happy to wear a cute dress, wouldn't you!\r\nYui: Right? So then, we eat some tasty food in Chinatown, and have a good time going around to all the cute general stores...\r\nMihono: That'd be fun~! But...\r\nTsugumi: Things have gone back to playing out exactly the same as before, haven't they...\r\nYui: Hold your horses-! The main event starts right here!\r\nYui: While the two of us are having a good time on our date, a group of burly thugs shows up and surrounds us, then tells you this:\r\nYui: \"Hey, pretty little thing, want to come have a good time with us...\"\r\nYui: That's when the thugs try to take you away by force. But then, I shout, \"Get your hands off my girlfriend-!\" and give the guys a high kick while I'm still in my China dress!\r\nYui: To protect the girl I love, I start pumping out stylish moves, taking down the punks one after another. And, completely captivated by me, my girlfriend says:\r\nYui: \"Thank you! I owe you my life. To make it up to you... You. Can. Have. Me...\"\r\nYui: Kyaa-! Y'know, you're a lot bolder than I thought... But, what kind of woman turns down a woman's advances! Now's not the time to hold ourselves back! And then, the two of us spend our sweet time together... Eheheheh...\r\nYui: So, what do you think? Don't you want to go on a date like that?\r\nMihono: Ummm... I want to wear a China dress, but... Everything after that is a little...\r\nTsugumi: To begin with, it's hard to imagine such a convenient group of thugs would appear at such convenient timing...\r\nYui: Come onnn... But I came up with the strongest, most exciting Chinatown fantasy date plan in history...\r\nYui: Wawah, Yui's all depressed now...\r\nTsugumi: If we were to leave her like this, it would weigh on our conscience, wouldn't it. We have to come up with something to support her...\r\nMihono: Yui, I think everybody has their own different kind of date they dream about, but I got to have a lot of fun today because you were with us! So thanks.\r\nTsugumi: That's right. And, I was able to mostly understand what the definition of a date is too...\r\nYui: You mean it!? I'm so glad~! I should be the one thanking you two! Getting to go on a three girl date through Chinatown made me the happiest girl in the world!\r\nTsugumi: A three girl date...? Can you really call an outing with three people a date? Sigh... I'm understanding the definition less and less."}, {"paste_key": "N1NRKUAh", "title": "Toji Edo Detective Story", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/N1NRKUAh", "timestamp": "", "hits": "92", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykb5ayM4CRY\r\n\r\n1:\u3000Shidou Maki's Right Hand Man\r\n\r\nWatanuki Kazumi: Continuing on, there have been reports of damage caused by aradama. For reasons unknown, the film set of a historical drama has frequently come under attack.\r\nMaki: If this report made it all the way to me, that must mean standard attempts at stopping them haven't worked.\r\nKazumi: Yes, it's just as you've guessed, Maki-sama. Several days ago, the toji responsible for the area reported that they had finished suppressing the aradama.\r\nKazumi: However, aradama have been sighted at that film studio several times after.\r\nMaki: ...And they can't get any filming done like that, can they.\r\nKazumi: The studio is in the middle of filming a drama about the Shinsengumi, and doesn't wish to suspend shooting any longer than necessary. They have requested we eliminate all of the aradama.\r\nMaki: It's possible some might have escaped the first time, but maybe there's some underlying reason they came back?\r\nMaki: Though it won't do any good to worry about it here. I'll head to that film studio myself.\r\nMaki: And I'd like your assistance. Come with me.\r\nKazumi: Whatever you face, wherever you go, I would join you, Maki-sama.\r\nMaki: You love to exagerrate, don't you, Kazumi.\r\nMaki: Oh. One more thing. I'd also like to bring a few inexperienced toji with us. Can I ask you to handle selecting them?\r\nKazumi: That won't be an issue, though... It may cause us trouble carrying out our mission.\r\nMaki: It doesn't matter. What's important is they have a chance to improve. They may have some difficulties, but the two of us should be able to take care of them, shouldn't we?\r\nKazumi: ...Yes!\r\nKazumi: (Without fail... I'll do what it takes to meet Maki-sama's expectations.)\r\nMaki: Preparing the next generation is one of our most important responsibilities, you know.\r\nKazumi: Then, I'll find several candidates and call them here. Please give me some time.\r\n\r\nKazumi: From talking to the studio's supervisor and director, aradama were seen around this lot again today.\r\nKazumi: They said they can avoid filming on this set for the time being, but the film crew is still feeling concerned.\r\nMaki: I'll bet... I'd prefer if they stopped filming altogether until things have settled with the aradama here.\r\nNovice Toji A: M-My spectrum finder is picking up a few signals! ...They're close by!\r\nMaki: Already showing themselves then.\r\nMaki: We're going into combat. Stick close to me. However, don't do anything you don't feel safe with.\r\n\r\nMaki: HAAAH-!\r\nAradama: ......\r\nNovice Toji B: Wow... They all went down, before I could blink.\r\nNovice Toji C: That's just how strong Shidou-senpai is!\r\nMaki: Did they drop something just now?\r\nKazumi: Koban, it seems. More than likely a prop used in the filming here. [Koban are the golden oval coins used in feudal Japan]\r\nMaki: Just to be safe, I'll bring these back with us.\r\nKazumi: Then, I will guide the other girls through recovering the noro.\r\nMaki: Of course, thanks.\r\nMaki: It would be great if that's the end of them, but it can't be that easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Unexpected Reinforcements?\r\n\r\nKazumi: Maki-sama, I'm picking up aradama in this direction.\r\nMaki: Everyone, prepare to fight.\r\nMaki: Don't get careless, but if you do like you did in training, destroying aradama isn't that difficult.\r\nNovice Toji D: Sh-Shidou-senpai...!? Some toji are already engaging the aradama!?\r\nMaki: That's...\r\nSayaka: ...Kofuki.\r\nKofuki: Yeah, just leave it to me! Show me a good time, aradama-chan!\r\nAradama: ......\r\nKofuki: Heheh... And another one done!\r\nSayaka: More koban came out.\r\nKofuki: Beats me why. But who cares; let's go looking for the next aradama-chan.\r\nKazumi: You two, the toji from Renpu... Just what do you think you're doing?\r\nKofuki: Huh? We're toji, duh. Can't you figure the rest out?\r\nSayaka: Kofuki, you shouldn't talk to people like that. We're defeating the aradama.\r\nKazumi: That isn't what I meant--\r\nMaki: Kazumi. First, that noro needs to be secured. Go ahead with the preparations. I'll question these two.\r\nKazumi: Understood. I'll recover it straight away then.\r\nMirja: I came because I detected the aradama, but it seems you've safely brought them down.\r\nMaki: You're here too, Kitora Mirja...? Could I get you to explain why you're all here?\r\nSayaka: Tsugumi asked us to come here and defeat the strange aradama.\r\nKofuki: As soon as she finds out about some aradama acting funny, she starts asking for data.\r\nMaki: Ban Tsugumi. The toji attached to the aradama research team. If aradama are being suppressed, she would want a report on it. And you?\r\nMirja: I was off duty today, so I came to see a sword exhibit which had opened at a nearby museum.\r\nMirja: Afterwards, I stopped by this film studio, and that was when I detected the aradama.\r\nMaki: I see. I understand your circumstances now.\r\nKazumi: Then, Maki-sama, what should we do about these three?\r\nKofuki: \"Maki-sama\"?\r\nMaki: First, you two from Renpu. You helped us out by defeating the aradama, but you'll create problems acting on your own like that. You're going to be following our instructions now.\r\nSayaka: Understood.\r\nKofuki: ...If you say so.\r\nMirja: I can help too, Shidou Maki. I may be off duty, but I still have a responsibility when aradama are involved.\r\nMaki: Good. In that case, you can manage those two. I'm sure you've been on plenty of missions together, with the investigation team. I'll leave a few from our unit with you too.\r\nMaki: I'll be counting on you when our unit needs to coordinate with yours.\r\nMirja: I understand; that should be for the best. Itomi Sayaka, Shichinosato Kofuki, I look forward to working with you.\r\nKofuki: Course, same here.\r\nSayaka: You look happy, Kofuki.\r\nKofuki: Don't know what you're talking about. Let's get going already.\r\nMirja: Wait until we all leave, Shichinosato Kofuki.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: How Toji Fight and Grow\r\n\r\nNovice Toji A: ...W-We're going to fight that aradama, aren't we.\r\nNovice Toji C: It's kind of scary...\r\nKazumi: It's natural to feel uneasy. Even so, you are toji. You mustn't forget that.\r\nMaki: This is the largest of any we've defeated today. Alright, let me handle that one myself.\r\nKazumi: Maki-sama... You'll fight it alone?\r\nMaki: That way, I can take care of it without putting them in danger. I need you to take care of the other smaller aradama for me, Kazumi.\r\nMaki: Handling all of them at once would be too much for me.\r\nKazumi: Understood. I can't allow you to be in danger either, Maki-sama.\r\nMaki: Right, that's why I'm glad you're with me. The rest of you, follow Kazumi's directions as you suppress the aradama.\r\nTwo Novice Toji: ...U-Understood!\r\n\r\nMaki: ...Hmph! Time to finish this.\r\nMaki: HYAAAAAAAA-!\r\nNovice Toji C: Amazing... Shidou-senpai, she beat an aradama that big with one swing...\r\nNovice Toji C: ...Eh!?\r\nKazumi: You don't have the luxury of looking away. Focus on the aradama before you.\r\nNovice Toji C: R-Right! Thank you, Watanuki-senpai...!\r\nNovice Toji A: ...TAAAH-!\r\n\r\nMaki: You're doing great. If you keep up the effort, this mission will be done in no time.\r\nNovice Toji A: Th-Thank you very much! Because of Watanuki-senpai's support earlier, I think I understand my timing better...\r\nMaki: Kazumi always does such a reliable job. Even I count on her support. So, she'd make a good role model for you.\r\nKazumi: ...That's more praise than I deserve. I'll do everything I can to continue meeting your expectations, Maki-sama.\r\nMaki: You always surpass them though. Don't feel the need to force yourself. Anyway, let's move on to the next group.\r\n\r\nMirja: The two of you will go after the aradama as a two man unit.\r\nMirja: If the aradama seems to be running, in order to keep damage to the studio to a minimum, lead it to the main street where Itomi Sayaka and Shichinosato Kofuki are waiting!\r\nNovice Toji B: ...G-Got it!\r\nMirja: We may have been hastily assembled, but we are a team. There's no need for you to fight by yourself. Understood?\r\nNovice Toji D: ...Yes ma'am!\r\nSayaka: Mirja... What next?\r\nMirja: Deal with the aradama in the main street, bearing in mind that Shichinosato Kofuki may leave her position.\r\nSayaka: Understood.\r\nKofuki: The hell, you think I'm some kinda dog that'll go running off chasing the first aradama-chan I see?\r\nSayaka: ...Won't you?\r\nKofuki: Sayaka... Now you're giving me attitude too!? So long as the aradama-chan keep coming, I'm not going anywhere!\r\nMirja: Then I'll hold you to that, Shichinosato Kofuki!\r\nKofuki: --Alright, alright, here they come!\r\nKofuki: Aradama-chan, I love you-!\r\nSayaka: I'll take this one.\r\nKofuki: Come on; it's first come, first serve!\r\nSayaka: Then, I'll go first.\r\nNovice Toji B: You know? I was disappointed, getting pulled off of Shidou-senpai's unit, but...\r\nNovice Toji D: These girls are pretty impressive too...\r\nMirja: Rather than defeating them, you need to become used to fighting aradama. We're going to be herding the aradama into the main street!\r\nTwo Novice Toji: ...Understood!\r\n\r\nMaki: Even with the unpredictable Shichinosato Kofuki under her command, Kitora Mirja is expertly directing them.\r\nMaki: More than fighting personally, taking command seems to be her specialty.\r\nKazumi: Yes, I can tell she's taking care not to push those inexperienced toji too hard.\r\nKazumi: While their plan is primarily to herd the aradama, if the chance arises, she steps in to finish them herself.\r\nMaki: It'll do well for getting them used to working in the field. We might get unexpectedly good results from this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: A Big Brawl Eliminating Aradama\r\n\r\nKazumi: That's the source of all this trouble. What an... Ominous aradama...\r\nKofuki: Tch... Why am I stuck with the small fry?\r\nMirja: There are still other aradama to be dealt with! You don't time to waste complaining.\r\nKofuki: I know already!\r\nKazumi: Maki-sama... May the battle end in our favor.\r\n\r\nSayaka: Kh... A little more. If this goes on, the studio will be destroyed...\r\nMaki: Right, we have to finish it off with our next attack!! Give me a hand!\r\nSayaka: Understood.\r\nMaki: --This is it for you! HAAAAAAAAH-!!\r\nSayaka: Look at all the koban...\r\nMirja: The aradama that accompanied it are fleeing! We can't allow them to escape--\r\nKazumi: ...That goes without saying!\r\nKofuki: I could handle all these myself!\r\nMirja: Impressive work; just as I would expect from you two.\r\n\r\nMaki: Kitora Mirja, Itomi Sayaka, Shichinosato Kofuki. Thank you for your assistance today.\r\nKofuki: If you wanted to thank me, you should've let me have that big one back there.\r\nMaki: Out of the question. You tend to toy around too much instead of finishing the job.\r\nKofuki: Tch... And now I don't get to have any fun.\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nMirja: Is something on your mind, Itomi Sayaka?\r\nSayaka: We defeated a lot of aradama today, so we got a lot of data. Tsugumi should be happy too.\r\nMirja: I see. I'm sure that she will be.\r\nStudio Manager: You said you're done suppressing the aradama, but... Uh, is it really safe around here?\r\nMaki: I understand your concern. But, this time, we've destroyed what we think was the source of the aradama. They shouldn't appear here any longer.\r\nStudio Manager: ...Phew. Thank you very much. That'll give us some peace of mind, right, director?\r\nFilm Director: That's good to hear. Now we can finish filming that big action scene we started! I really can't thank you enough!\r\nMaki: You don't have to thank us. We just did what we need to as toji.\r\nFilm Director: I mean it! I watched your fighting from a distance, and it was so inspiring. It'll make great reference material!\r\nFilm Director: You should take these, as a show of appreciation. Thank you. I have to get going now!\r\nMaki: Ah... But, we can't accept...\r\nKazumi: ...He's already leaving.\r\nFilm Director: Now I just have to figure out what to do about that action sequence... What to do... Hmm...\r\nSayaka: ...Historical costumes?\r\nMirja: Judging by the uneven pattern on these haori, these must be Shinsengumi costumes.\r\nMirja: That reminds me, Asakura Mihono's okatana, Kashuu Kiyomitsu, was once carried by Okita Souji of the Shinsengumi. It might be fitting to have her wear this haori. Speaking of the Shinsengumi--\r\nSayaka: ...Mirja?\r\nKofuki: Forget her. Just let her talk to herself.\r\nMaki: They gave them to us, but I'm not exactly sure what to do with them now.\r\nKofuki: There's only one thing to do: put it on, senpai. Wouldn't kill you to wear it for a while, right?\r\nKazumi: You're being too rude. Maki-sama deserves more of your respect...\r\nKofuki: I'm not changing how I talk no matter who I'm talking to. And besides, don't you wanna see senpai in that haori too?\r\nKazumi: Th-That's besides the...\r\nMaki: I don't think I'll wear it after all. I'm no actor, so it'd be a bit embarrassing.\r\nFilm Director: No, I need you to wear that haori! And, would you do me the favor of appearing in my movie!?\r\nMaki: Wh... Where is this coming from...?\r\nFilm Director: Those natural movements I saw from you, swinging your sword as you fought those aradama! That's just what I need in this movie!\r\nMaki: But, I'm...\r\nFilm Director: I've been stuck figuring out what do do with this action scene, but I realized, the answer was right in my face!\r\nFilm Director: If I truly want to express the spirit of a warrior, my only choice is to borrow the talent of someone like you... I'm begging you, please!\r\nMaki: I get where you're coming from. Raise your head, Mr. Director.\r\nFilm Director: So you'll be in the film!?\r\nMaki: Oh, no, I can't act...\r\nFilm Director: Oh wow, you've saved me! I'm so lucky to have you toji around. On top of destroying the aradama, you're even lending your efforts to the film!\r\nMaki: But, I said...\r\nFilm Director: There's nothing to worry about. We'll provide you all the support you could ask for. And anyway, that haori would look just perfect on you, I know it.\r\nFilm Director: Everyone, come on over here. This toji girl said she'd be helping us out. Ah, tell the makeup and costume artists too. Here, come with me.\r\nMaki: Ahh...\r\nFilm Director: Alright, time to film something spectacular!\r\nKofuki: Kuku... Things are getting interesting 'round here.\r\nKazumi: ...Will Maki-sama truly be in a movie?\r\n\r\nSeveral months after the mission at the movie studio, on the movie's opening day.\r\n\r\nYume: I can't wait to see Maki-onee-san's movie~!\r\nSuzuka: I never thought I'd see Maki-san's debut on the silver screen.\r\nSuzuka: Though, adjusting our schedules so the whole elite guard could be here today did give us some trouble.\r\nMaki: Yume, Suzuka... I keep telling you, I'm not the main character or anything, remember...?\r\nYume: I just wanna see you show up in it, Maki-onee-san. It'll be worth seeing for sure!\r\nMaki: Ugh... Why didn't I say no back then? I should just be happy Yukari-sama didn't come to see...\r\nYomi: Yukari-sama was invited to a pre-screening. She should have seen it already.\r\nMaki: She what...?\r\nYume: Let's get to the movie theater already. I want some popcorn! Come on, come on! Let's go!\r\nSuzuka: Come along, Maki-san.\r\nKazumi: (Maki-sama. I... I'll gladly watch this movie as often as I can!)"}, {"paste_key": "cdsmBXUQ", "title": "Toji Notes: -The Heroes of Twenty Years Ago-", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/cdsmBXUQ", "timestamp": "", "hits": "94", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWPpXSEiGbY\r\n\r\n1: The \"Toji Notes\" of 20 Years Ago\r\n\r\nKaoru: Sigh, why're we the ones who've gotta sort the books in the library?\r\nEllen: Didn't you listen to what Sana-sensei was saying? A lot of new books are coming in, so the old ones need to be archived. This is as important a job as any other.\r\nKaoru: I got all that. But, why us...? And just look at all these old books... Cough... Cough... They're all caked in dust... Cough...\r\nMai: They sure are. But, while we're here, we should make an effort to clean them off and neatly pack them away. Cough, cough...\r\nMihono: Right. This is the job we were given, so we should give it our all! Let's see, history books go in this box, and swordfighting books go...\r\nMihono: Huh? The box with the swordfighting books is gone!\r\nKanami: Hm hmm...\r\nKanami: Oh wow! I didn't know that style had that kind of history-!\r\nEllen: Kanamin just locked right onto the old swordfighting books, huh.\r\nKaoru: Ever since I heard we were dealing with old books, I figured this would happen. Still, there's way too many of them. They just keep piling up and up...\r\nKaoru: Ah, this book! This is just the book I've been looking for...\r\nMai: It's very thick, isn't it? It's a compilation of all that author's works.\r\nMihono: Huh, so you read tough books like that, Kaoru-san...\r\nKaoru: Nn? Read? When'd I say anything about that?\r\nKaoru: This thickness, and just the right firmness, it's the exact type I've been looking for this whole time. I'm gonna test it out right away...\r\nKaoru: ZZZZZZZZZZZ...\r\nMai: That's more like Kaoru-san: using a book as a pillow for a nap.\r\nEllen: Kanamin's busy reading, Kaoru's busy sleeping; at this rate, we'll be cleaning up forever!\r\nMihono: But Kaoru-san and Kanami look like they're having such a nice time, so I'd feel bad for interrupting them...\r\nMihono: How about I work hard enough to cover for both of them!\r\nMihono: Swordfighting... History... Geography... Literature... And...\r\nEllen: Wow! Look at her go! A mountain of books is piling up around Mihomiho!\r\nMihono: Swordfighting, swordfighting, history, swordfighting...\r\nMihono: Uwah-! Watch out, book avalanche~!\r\nEllen: Oh my god! Right after you sorted them all!\r\nKaoru: Zzzzz... Nn? What's so noisy...\r\nKaoru: ...Hey! Why're all the books on the floor.\r\nMihono: Wahh, I'm sorry-!\r\nKanami: I'm the one who should be sorry, Mihono-chan. I shouldn't have been getting lost in books like that. I'll try harder too.\r\nMihono: Thanks, Kanami!\r\nMihono: Then, all the books on the floor here... Huh? Hey, take a look at this! There's a notebook mixed in here...\r\nEllen: It says \"Toji Notes\" on it.\r\nMai: It seems to be some kind of anthology of notes an older generation of toji left behind for us.\r\nKanami: Toji Notes... My mom told me about this, a long time ago!\r\nKanami: Whenever we'd go to hot springs together, she'd always say \"This takes me back\" and smile like she was remembering something.\r\nKanami: When I asked her why, all she would say was, \"Instead of hearing it from me, you should find the Toji Notes someday.\"\r\nKanami: Ah, I found my mom's notes! I wonder if she wrote about the hot springs in here...\r\nMihono: Ehhh-!? What's an aradama doing in the library!?\r\nAradama: Keeeeeeee!\r\nKanami: Hm...? It's just staring at my mom's notes...\r\nEllen: Maybe it's interested in what your mama wrote down too?\r\nMihono: Kanami's mom is even popular with aradama! She's amazing!\r\nKanami: Ahaha, she's not that amazing~.\r\nKaoru: This isn't really the time to be screwing around.\r\nAradama: Keeeeee!\r\nMai: Oh, it ran off with the notes...\r\nKanami: EHHH---!? I didn't even get to read them yet-!!\r\nEllen: Even worse! There's a lot of pages missing! I think it ran off with a bunch of toji's notes!\r\nKaoru: If that ha... If the president finds out, we're screwed...\r\nMai: It's a one of a kind handwritten notebook. We have to get it back in one piece.\r\nKanami: Yeah! I want to find out what my mom was smiling about too! Let's get those pages back from that aradama!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Origami Yukari of 20 Years Ago\r\n\r\nEllen: We finally got a volume of the notes back. They're from 20 years ago, but the toji's name was... Wow!\r\nKaoru: The handwriting's so neat it's actually hard to read... Renpu Senior High School, 2nd year, Origami Yukari... Hang on a sec! It can't be the Origami Yukari, can it!?\r\nKanami: The head of the Origami family, back when she was our age! I wonder what she was like then. Let's all read some of it together!\r\n\r\nYukari: Aren't you feeling tired, Kagari? You've been up night after night training lately. There's no need to push yourself so hard.\r\nKagari: I'm doing fine. It's simply a part of my duties; living with you as your constant attendant.\r\nMinato: Yukari, Kagari, morning-! Hey hey, Yukari, do me a favor! Help me out!\r\nYukari: What is it, Minato? You're bowing your head awfully desperately first thing in the morning.\r\nMinato: Let me copy your homework! I was so tired from training yesterday that I passed out. Just let me copy you this one time, okay? You're cool with that, right, Yukari?\r\nKagari: I remember hearing the same excuse last week... [mumbled]\r\nYukina: Yukari-onee-samaaaa~!\r\nYukari: Oh, Yukina...\r\nKagari: Sigh... I'll take her to our classroom, before she gets her hands on Yukari-sama. Excuse me...\r\nYukina: Hey, Kagari! Let go of me! Yukari-onee-samaaa~! Ahhn, wait for meee~, Onee-samaaa~!\r\nKagari: Give it up already. The first year classrooms are this way. Every morning, you never learn...\r\nMinato: That reminds me, does Kagari have any friends? I never see her with anyone besides Yukina, and I don't know if that really counts...\r\nYukari: (It's true, Kagari has never once introduced a friend of hers to me. Maybe it's because...)\r\nMinato: Nn? Looks like something's bothering you, Yukari... Is it because... You're worried about Kagari, right?\r\nYukari: You see right through me. That's right. I think the reason Kagari has no friends is because she's always serving at my side.\r\nMinato: Well, that's just the kind of family you were born into, so there's nothing you can really do... But, I've got an idea on how to fix things!\r\nYukari: Fix things?\r\nMinato: I'll be Kagari's first friend! That way, you'll feel better too, right?\r\nYukari: Minato...\r\nMinato: Best to strike while it's hot! Let's take a detour when the three of us go home together today.\r\n\r\nAfter school that day.\r\n\r\nKagari: Yukari-sama, why are we stopping by here...?\r\nYukari: Everyone needs a break sometimes. There's nothing wrong with spending our time after school like ordinary high school girls.\r\nMinato: You heard her. Sometimes, you just have to let loose. Ooh, Kagari, I'll buy you a croquette!\r\nKagari: For me? Why would I...\r\nMinato: Ehh, then, what about if I give you half the yakisoba I bought! Here, say ahhh!\r\nKagari: No thank you. Dinner will be ready once we get home.\r\nYukari: (Even with Minato's friendliness, Kagari refuses to open her heart...)\r\nMinato: Oh, duh! Every girl loves sweets. Wait here, I'll buy you something delicious.\r\nMinato: And I'm back~! Here, have some mamekan. The stuff that shop over there makes is good like you wouldn't believe. Don't just take my word for it, try it.\r\nKagari: Gulp... If you'll go to those lengths, then fine. But only one bite... Chew chew...\r\nKagari: It is good...\r\nYukari: (I've never seen Kagari make such a soft expression before.)\r\nMinato: I told you so, didn't I? Here, I got some for Yukari and me too!\r\nKagari: We aren't going to eat all that much... Om om... Chew chew...\r\nMinato: Ahaha, you say that, but you already cleaned it out!\r\nKagari: Ah-!\r\nYukari: (Fufu, Minato might actually have what it takes to be Kagari's first friend.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Fujiwara Minato of 20 Years Ago\r\n\r\nMihono: There, another volume! I wonder who wrote this one?\r\nKanami: Fujiwara Minato... That's my mom! We finally got it back~. Okay, let's see what she wrote already!\r\n\r\nMinato: Ahh~, today's practice wore me out. Wait? Where's Kagari?\r\nYukari: She's involved with a school event, so we'll be separated today. By the way, I never thanked you for the other day. I knew I could count on you to get Kagari to open up.\r\nMinato: Nah, I still have a long long way to go. Actually, I need a favor from you, Yukari! Could you help me out a little, so I can get closer to Kagari?\r\nYukari: Help you? With what?\r\nMinato: When I saw her eating mamekan back then, I realized, if we made Kagari's favorite foods, she'd probably be super happy.\r\nYukari: I see. I can help with that then. Kagari's favorite foods... How about kenchin soba?\r\nMinato: Kenchin soba!? Kagari sure has some refined tastes.\r\nMinato: But, we should at least be able to make that! Let's try it right after school tomorrow.\r\n\r\nMinato: Okay, let's get right to it!\r\nYukari: Of course. All the ingredients have been provided by the Origami household.\r\nMinato: Radish, carrot, burdock... Nn? Buckwheat flour!? Hang on, Yukari! Don't tell me you plan on starting at pounding noodles from scratch?\r\nYukari: Naturally. We said we would be making it by hand. I'll pound the soba, so please take care of the kenchin soup.\r\nMinato: Okay, I'm on it. Let's make kenchin soba so good Kagari won't know what hit her-!\r\n\r\nMinato: Yukari, once this finishes simmering, I'm all done here.\r\nYukari: Hmph... Hmph... Hmph...\r\nMinato: That's crazy! The way you're kneading that would put the pros to shame! Next up is the main event: chopping the noodles. This part's going to take a skilled hand.\r\nYukari: Don't worry. Leave it to me.\r\nMinato: Wait, a kitchen knife in both hands! You aren't gonna...\r\nYukari: TAAAAAH!\r\nMinato: Dual wielding's cutting the soba up twice as fast!\r\nYukari: Phew, now we only need to boil it and we're through here.\r\nMinato: That was incredible, Yukari. I never thought your skills with an okatana would come in handy here...\r\nMinato: It'd be better if we boiled it after Kagari gets here, right? I'll go look for her.\r\n\r\nMinato: Kagari-! Oiii, Kagari, where'd you go-?\r\n\r\nMinato: Sorry, Yukari. I looked all over school, but I couldn't find her. Where'd she even go...\r\nMinato: Sigh~, and we went to all this effort too...\r\nYukari: Kagari, shouldn't you come out already?\r\nMinato: Huh?\r\nKagari: You noticed me here, Yukari-sama?\r\nYukari: Yes, I've had a vague sense you were here for a while now.\r\nMinato: Hey, Kagari! Were you hiding and watching us this whole time?\r\nKagari: Yes. It's my duty to always serve at Yukari-sama's side, after all.\r\nMinato: What the heck. So that means, it's no use trying to surprise you either, huh...\r\nYukari: I went ahead and boiled the soba while you were searching, Minato. Here, let's all eat together.\r\nMinato: Good thinking, Yukari! Then, you're up first, Kagari. We're pretty proud of how it turned out!\r\nKagari: Is that so. I'll try it then. Chew chew...\r\nKagari: This is delicious... Chew chew... Om om... Chew chew...\r\nMinato: The operation was a total success! With this, we're friends for sure!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Hiiragi Kagari of 20 Years Ago\r\n\r\nMihono: We read all of Kanami's mom's notes, but that story about the hot spring didn't come up anywhere.\r\nKanami: Hmmm, I know. I still want to find out... What it was my mom was remembering.\r\nMai: Maybe there's something written about it in another toji's notes?\r\nKaoru: That reminds me, in this latest batch we found, there's notes from Hiiragi Kagari in here.\r\nEllen: Hiiragi Kagari... That's Hiyoyon's mama!\r\nKanami: Since my mom wanted to be friends with Hiyori-chan's mom, maybe whatever she was smiling about is in here! Let's read it!\r\n\r\nYukari: Kagari, this may seem sudden, but I'm giving you the next two days off.\r\nKagari: Time off? You know I don't need that. Where is this coming from?\r\nYukari: I knew you'd react like this. But, breaks are necessary to reliably perform your day to day tasks.\r\nKagari: If that's what you'd order me to do, of course I'll carry it out... But, with how sudden this is, I'm not sure how I should spend my time off...\r\nMinato: I figured you'd say that, so I already made a reservation for us. Two days and one night at a hot springs inn! We're leaving tomorrow: you, me, and Ema.\r\nKagari: Minato-senpai!? What are you saying, barging in here out of nowhere... You made reservations without me? You're always like this; always so pushy.\r\nYukari: What's the harm in it? I'll feel better if you're with Minato and Ema. Take your time in the warm waters and come back feeling refreshed.\r\nKagari: Kh... If those are your orders, Yukari-sama...\r\n\r\nThe next morning...\r\n\r\nKagari: Why is it only the two of us here? Where's Ema-senpai?\r\nMinato: She said she had to take care of something. But she'll meet up with us later, so it's just us two for now.\r\nKagari: I see...\r\nMinato: So, how about we break out the bento boxes already! Chew chew chew.... Nnn, so good~! There's something about eating on a train that makes it even tastier.\r\nKagari: If you say so... Chew chew...\r\nMinato: Come on, act a little excited. If we're done eating, I brought cards! Let's play old maid!\r\nMinato: Whoever loses, how about... You have to do an impression of someone close to you? Even you'll take it seriously with that on the line, right?\r\nKagari: ...I'm not going to compete with you.\r\nMinato: Huh? You know, Kagari, if you back down here, that counts as a loss by default? And what would Yukari think if she found out you were running away from a match?\r\nKagari: Kh... Even when you're inviting someone, you're so heavy handed. Fine then. All I have to do is win then, is that right? I'll accept your challenge.\r\n\r\nMinato: Nice-! That's a win for me!\r\nKagari: Kh, how could I lose...\r\nMinato: Time to hold up your side of the bargain, Kagari. Someone close to you~ that's gotta be Yukari, right?\r\nKagari: I-I could never impersonate Yukari-sama.\r\nMinato: But you lost, so I guess you'll just have to give it your best shot.\r\nKagari: It's true I lost... But, for me to mock the person I serve...\r\nKagari: ............\r\nMinato: Hurry up, unless you want to wait for Ema to join in so you can have a bigger audience? I promise I'll keep it a secret from Yukari, okay!\r\nKagari: (Ah, that's right! I have another option.)\r\nKagari: Then, I'll begin my impersonation... Of Yukina, following Yukari-sama every morning on the way to school.\r\nKagari: Yukari-onee-samaaa~! Ahhn, please wait for meee~, Onee-samaaa~!\r\nMinato: Uwah! You went with Yukina!? And you sound just like her too! Ahahaha! Way to go, Kagari!\r\nMinato: Man, I didn't think you'd be so good at this.\r\nKagari: I've seen it so many mornings that I'm sick of it, after all.\r\nTrain Announcer: Last stop~, this is the last stop~.\r\nMinato: Ahahahaha, I didn't even notice we were here, I was laughing too hard. You really are funny, Kagari~. I'm glad we're friends~!\r\nKagari: N-Nobody's ever said that to me before...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Finished Reading the \"Toji Notes\"...\r\n\r\nKanami: Wait, Kagari-san's notes only cover up to the train arriving at the station! Where's the rest?\r\nEllen: There's no sign that the aradama tore any more pages out, so I don't think there's any more to the story.\r\nMai: That's right. And each volume has a set number of pages, so I think this might just be the end of it?\r\nKanami: Then, that would mean, what my mom was remembering was the impression Kagari-san did!?\r\nMihono: It must have been really funny if she was still thinking back to it as an adult. I wish I could've seen it too-!\r\nEllen: That solves the mystery of Kanamin's mama, but it makes you want to see what comes next at the hot springs, doesn't it!\r\nKanami: I know-! Looking at notes from the other toji, there's nothing about it.\r\nMihono: What happened at the hot springs? Did Minato-san and Kagari-san start getting along? Did they have a really good time? I wanna know-!\r\nKaoru: You know, if they wrote this much about just the train ride there, I think they had a lot of fun with it.\r\nEllen: Me too. They were best buddies by the time of the disaster. They must have gotten along on this hot spring trip.\r\nMihono: Still, it's weird to think that the head of the family and the others were just normal high school girls.\r\nKaoru: Right? Hiyoyon's mom seems like she'd be just as fun to bully as Hiyoyon herself.\r\nEllen: And Kanamin's mama seems like a good girl; full of energy and always looking out for her friends!\r\nKanami: Ehehe, it's sort of embarassing hearing you say that.\r\nMihono: Our coach always says, \"Toji in the past used to train so hard every day; they never had time to play around,\" but they totally did.\r\nEllen: Training is important of course, but you can tell just from reading these that toji in the past enjoyed their school lives too!\r\nMai: What if President Maniwa entrusted us with this job because she wanted us to figure that out...\r\nKaoru: No way. She'd never be that roundabout...\r\nKaoru: Actually, hang on. The president seems like she'd be bad with that kind of life guidance, so it's actually believable.\r\nKanami: Either way, we should thank President Maniwa for letting us work in here. Thanks to her, I got to solve a mystery about my mom.\r\nKaoru: Speak of the devil, she's calling.\r\nKaoru: Yep, our work's coming along great right now.\r\nKanami: Kaoru-chan, pass me the phone! Hello, President Maniwa! Thanks for giving us such a great job to do.\r\nKanami: Thanks to you, I had a lot of fun learning what my mom and everyone were like back then! Here, I'll give it back to Kaoru-chan now.\r\nKaoru: So anyway, thanks to those notes, we found a good way to waste some time. What do you think; you happy now?\r\nSana: Kaoru, you seem to think it's none of your business, but you girls are supposed to write your notes in there too.\r\nKaoru: What? You never told me anything about that.\r\nSana: Well, that's how it is. So use what's there as a reference and each of you work on preparing your own notes.\r\nKaoru: Wait, hold up! Nobody ever said we were going to have to write anything! Sigh, this annoying work just keeps piling up...\r\nEllen: Kaoru, that's not all the work we have to do. We were chosen to make up the editorial committee for everyone's notes. That's why we got this job sorting the books.\r\nMihono: We were!?\r\nKanami: Being the editorial committee means we get to read all the notes before anyone else, right? That sounds like fun~.\r\nMai: That's a big responsibility. Let's work hard at it, okay?\r\nKaoru: Sorting books... Writing notes... Editorial committee... Ahh... I'm feeling lightheaded...\r\nMihono: Wah, the stack of books fell down-! Kaoru-san, are you okay!?\r\nKaoru: Haha... That's even more work to do... Hahaha... Even more... More work..."}, {"paste_key": "pYv1dmdQ", "title": "Battle Girls Party!

You're self-conscious about it?\r\nChie: Kaoru-san!\r\nEllen: ...Well if you don't like it, then that's that. We can be Team Osafune Mashiko instead!\r\nKaoru: That's even worse!\r\nEllen: And why's that?\r\nKaoru: The name makes it sound like I'm in charge. That's way too much work.\r\n\r\nChie: Now then, let's start the meeting. Our members are...\r\nChie: Mm, everyone's here.\r\nMai: Our group is in charge of the entertainment for the recognition party.\r\nKanami: Konohana-san, who's leading the committee, said to come up with something that could \"satisfactorily conclude the year\".\r\nEllen: I want to make a bigger attraction than the main event! We can't lose to Hanahana!\r\nKaoru: How're we supposed to stand out more than the main event though?\r\nHashi Keiko: (H-Huh? Why does it seem like everyone already knows each other?)\r\nKeiko: (I'm being left out... I can't join the conversation... It's too much for an outsider like me...)\r\nMihono: Wait wait, stooop!\r\nKaoru: Nn? What's up, Mihono? If you have to go to the bathroom, hurry it up.\r\nMihono: That's okay, I already went before the meeting!\r\nMihono: But what I mean is, shouldn't we all introduce ourselves first? Hashi-san looks really lost.\u3000\r\nKeiko: (I might as well not be here... I have to get back to my monkey wrench and...)\r\nKeiko: Wh-Why is everyone looking at me!? D-Did you want me to come up with something!?\r\nChie: Fufu, you're always watching out for others, Mihono-chan. Since we toji all know each other, we went straight into the meeting, didn't we?\r\nEllen: Nice thinking, Mihomiho! Let's introduce ourselves! I'm Kohagura Ellen, from Osafune Girls' Academy!\r\nKeiko: Ah... Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Hashi Keiko, taking preparatory courses in engineering at Ayanokouji Martial Arts School...\r\nChie: I'll go next. I'm from Osafune Girls' Academy...\r\n\r\nChie: Now that we all know each other, we can start the meeting properly. If you want to make any suggestions, don't hesitate to tell us, okay, Hashi-san?\r\nKeiko: Y-Yes, I will. I'll try... But if I don't have much to say, I'm sorry...\r\nEllen: You're funny, Hajihaji!\r\nKeiko: Th-Thank you...\r\nKanami: Setouchi-san, for the entertainment... Could we do something like the official tournament?\r\nKaoru: Oi oi, do you have any idea how many toji there are in the Five Traditions?\r\nKanami: Enough to let us have plenty of matches with all kinds of toji!\r\nChie: That certainly would feel like a conclusion to the year, but... Wouldn't it be hard to organize? Maybe we should think of something more simple...\r\nKanami: Hmm, that's too bad then!\r\nMai: It has to be fun and entertaining, while also concluding the year...\r\nMai: It's difficult, isn't it, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: I feel like smoke's gonna start coming out of my ears~! I wanna eat something sweet!\r\nMai: Ah, in that case, I have these sakura macarons. Want one?\r\nMihono: Of course! Thanks, Mai!\r\nKanami: Oh, I want one too! Mmm~, macarons are so good!\r\nKeiko: Um, Yanase-san, those macarons... Nevermind.\r\nMai: I have plenty to go around, so don't worry. Here you go, Hashi-san.\r\nKeiko: Thank you very much. ...Ah, it's good.\r\nMihono: Right? Mai's really good at cooking!\r\nKanami: She can make cookies and all kinds of stuff, and they're all super tasty.\r\nKeiko: Not only are you a toji, but you're also good at cooking... You're amazing, Yanase-san...!\r\nMai: I-It's not that amazing~.\r\nKeiko: ...This is so good that, maybe, we could make everyone compete for Yanase-san's cooking...\r\nKaoru: Now there's an eccentric idea.\r\nEllen: But it sounds like fun too!\r\nEllen: We could set up a lot of prizes and a raffle, and start a battle royale!\r\nChie: What if we gave every toji a raffle ticket, and they had to try and take each other's while protecting their own...?\r\nChie: We could call it a raffle competition!\r\nKaoru: That's taking it pretty literally.\r\nEllen: You don't get it, Kaoru! That's what's great about it!\r\nChie: Does anyone have any objections...?\r\nMai: It isn't really an objection, but... How are students that aren't toji meant to participate?\r\nChie: Ah, you're right, we didn't think of that...\r\nKeiko: Um, in that case... What if we gave the average number of raffle tickets the executive committee gets to all the non-toji students?\r\nKeiko: That way, you can join in supporting someone and have fun even if you're not fighting... Would that work?\r\nChie: I like the sound of that! Thank you, Hashi-san!\r\nChie: We'll go with that then. The entertainment at the recognition party will be a raffle competition!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: What Do We Want?\r\n\r\nSuzuka: A... Raffle competition?\r\nChie: Yes. We give raffle tickets to all the toji, and they compete over them for fun.\r\nSuzuka: While acting as a conclusion to the year, it also sounds entertaining... I like it.\r\nSuzuka: Very well. This year, we will carry out a raffle competition.\r\nChie: Okay, thank you!\r\nSuzuka: With that settled, next we need to think of what prizes will be in the raffle. Have you come up with a list?\r\nChie: Ah, not yet, we'll be deciding on the prizes in our next meeting.\r\nSuzuka: Then this works out nicely. Please include dresses as prizes.\r\n\r\nChie: Now then, let's think up what to put in the raffle!\r\nMai: We have to include dresses?\r\nChie: Yes. Konohana-san said, since we're having a big party, suggestions like that would be interesting.\r\nMihono: Dresses, huh... Wouldn't it be hard working up the courage to wear a dress while everyone's in uniform, Kanami?\r\nKanami: I know, Mihono-chan. I think it'd be hard to move around in too.\r\nKeiko: (The conversation is getting off-topic... But it'd be better not to interrupt them...)\r\nEllen: Can we put whatever we want in the raffle, Chie?\r\nChie: Mmhm, anything within common sense.\r\nKaoru: ......Time off.\r\nMai: Eh? What was that, Kaoru-chan?\r\nKaoru: ...I want time off.\r\nChie: \"Time off\", there.\r\nKaoru: That'll work!?\r\nChie: It'll be more fun if there's all kinds of prizes in there. Feel free to come up with suggestions like Kaoru-san did, everyone.\r\nEllen: I'd like an all-you-can-eat dessert buffet!\r\nMihono: Or what about a free pass for the cafeteria?\r\nEllen: It's a big occasion, so let's put in both! The more you can win, the better it gets!\r\nChie: \"Dessert buffet\", \"Cafeteria pass\". Did you come up with anything, Etou-san, Yanase-san?\r\nKanami: Would a swordfight ticket work? You can use it to have a match with anyone you want.\r\nMai: I thought you'd go with something like that, Kanami-chan.\r\nMai: In my case... Why not an increase to club funding, or a chance to spend a day with the elite guard?\r\nChie: \"Swordfight ticket\", \"Club funding\", \"Spend a day with the elite guard\"...\r\nEllen: What about you, Hajihaji?\r\nKeiko: Me!?\r\nEllen: You don't have to think too hard about it. Just say whatever you want to do.\r\nKeiko: What I want to do... Then, servicing the Storm Armor, but with my skills...\r\nEllen: Worrying about it won't get you anywhere, Hajihaji. If you do screw something up, you can use that experience next time. It's no problem.\r\nKeiko: N-No problem? B-But, if I screw up, then the consequences...\r\nEllen: Then, let's think about how to get you some help with that!\r\nChie: What's important is a helper for your preparatory classes, right? Then you need someone to support you... We need to recruit people in advance.\r\nChie: And, when it comes to servicing... If nothing's wrong, you'll want to see a practical test of it. So we need to have toji ready too...\r\nChie: Ah, but, there's a chance someone from the engineering courses won't draw that prize. We have to make sure it works in case a toji draws it... Is there anything else we should consider?\r\nKeiko: N-No, if I have someone helping me, I think I should be fine.\r\nKeiko: But... I-Is this really okay?\r\nChie: As a preparatory engineering student, this would be a great experience for you, wouldn't it?\r\nChie: That's why I'm glad to have your point of view. Thank you, Hashi-san.\r\nKeiko: Y-You don't need to thank me for anything...\r\nChie: See, most of us here are toji, aren't we?\r\nChie: So, even if we try, it's hard to represent students from other departments. But we should think of prizes that everyone from the Five Traditions can have fun with!\r\n\r\nSuzuka: I see you took into account students from all departments. These prizes should do fine.\r\nSuzuka: I'll make an announcement summarizing the raffle competition to the Five Traditions.\r\nKaoru: We don't have to do anything to help with that, right?\r\nSuzuka: Not at all. You're doing more than enough by preparing the party's entertainment.\r\nSuzuka: ...I'm curious, why did you come this time in place of Setouchi-san?\r\nKaoru: ...I'm just that serious about this project. I want to make sure it's a success, no matter what.\r\nSuzuka: How reliable of you. You've been a great help, Mashiko-san.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Hashi Vanished\r\n\r\nToji A: Hey, did you see what they're doing for the recognition party's entertainment?\r\nToji B: I did! A raffle competition, right? I want that all-you-can-eat dessert buffet!\r\nToji A: I'm more interested in spending a day with the elite guard. You could get to work with Shidou-san!\r\nToji B: Better collect all the raffle tickets you can! Things are gonna get serious when it starts, you know?\r\nToji A: Same goes for you!\r\nKeiko: Uuu... People are already talking about the raffle competition.\r\nKeiko: I'm happy about getting to service Storm Armor, but... Can someone like me really handle that...\r\nKeiko: The nervousness is making my stomach hurt... Maintenance... It doesn't matter what, I have to do maintenance on something...\r\n\r\nMihono: Let's start today's work on preparing for the raffle competition!\r\nKanami: Oh, hold up, Mihono-chan. I don't think Hashi-san's here yet.\r\nMai: Hashi-san's never been late before... Setouchi-san, did she tell you anything?\r\nChie: I haven't heard from her. Maybe we should send someone to look for her?\r\nEllen: Sure thing! I'm on it!\r\nChie: Thank you, Ellen-san. I think it would help if we sent at least one more person though...\r\nKaoru: Pass. I'll be here to fill in Ellen's share while she's gone.\r\nEllen: What're you working so hard for, Kaoru?\r\nKaoru: I'm trying to rack up enough good karma to win that time off.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nKanami: That explains it. In that case, I'll go with Ellen-chan.\r\nEllen: Hi! Let's go, Kanamin!\r\n\r\nEllen: Hajihaji's not here, Kanamin. Where could she have gone?\r\nKanami: I know she was here after school ended.\r\nKanami: Somebody said she was walking around looking all dizzy.\r\nEllen: Walking around all dizzy... That sounds like trouble! Hajihaji must be in the infirmary or the dorms!\r\nEllen: I'll check the infirmary! You go see her dorm room, Kanamin!\r\nKanami: Okay!\r\n\r\nKeiko: Ughh....\r\nKanami: Hashi-san, are you in there? Huh, the door's unlocked... I'm coming in.\r\nKeiko: ...\r\nKanami: Oh, there you are... Hey, are you okay!? You're as pale as a ghost!?\r\nKeiko: Why is Etou-san here...?\r\nKanami: I came because we were worried about you!\r\nKeiko: I made Etou-san and the others worry about me... My life is over...\r\nKanami: It's still going on though!?\r\nKanami: Hold on, I have to message Ellen-chan real quick!\r\n\r\nKanami: ...So basically, you wanted to do maintenance on Storm Armor so badly that it made you nervous, so you hardly slept in order to study servicing it?\r\nKeiko: ...Yes. I can't fall asleep unless I've done some maintenance...\r\nEllen: Have you been up all this time? You're working yourself too hard, Hajihaji.\r\nKeiko: But I'm nervous... I have to distract myself with some maintenance...\r\nKeiko: Pliers are the best... Screws are cute... My heaven is here...\r\nEllen: Oh! Hajihaji has a metal fetish.\r\nKeiko: That's not it...\r\nKanami: Anyway, you have to relax, Hashi-san. Maybe Setouchi-san will have some advice to help you?\r\nKeiko: Even though I'm causing you so much trouble... Thank you so much. You must be goddess, Etou-san...\r\nKanami: I'm not though!?\r\n\r\nEllen: And that's how Kanamin became goddess!\r\nMihono: Haha-! Goddess Kanami-sama!\r\nKanami: I said I'm not!\r\nChie: Etou-san. What did Hashi-san have to say?\r\nKanami: Oh, yeah. If it's possible, she wants to focus on some kind of behind the scenes work that lets her use tools.\r\nChie: Okay, then let's let her do that. And also, we'll try to give her free time to practice maintenance in, okay?\r\nMihono: That's a good idea, Chii-nee! I'll go tell Hashi-san!\r\nKanami: Ah, wait up, Mihono-chan! I'll go too!\r\nKaoru: And they're gone. Did you want to go too, Mai?\r\nMai: I do, but... It's best not to surround her with too many people when she's not feeling well.\r\nKaoru: Okay. Then, we'll have to work extra hard to make up for them while they're gone.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Kaoru's Plan\r\n\r\nMihono: Huh!?\r\nKaoru: What happened, Mihono? Did you forget something?\r\nMihono: I didn't, but... Uhh, right now, I was going over the orders for the amount of prizes, and...\r\nNene: Nene-?\r\nMihono: The order for the dresses... There's enough dresses for all of the students.\r\nKaoru: Huh!? Oi! Who's the one that ordered the dresses!?\r\nKaoru: No, call up the supplier before anything...\r\nMai: Oh, that's not a mistake. Konohana-san placed the order for the dresses, so it's alright.\r\nKaoru: ...The elite guard are something else.\r\n\r\nEllen: Apparently, that's what happened, Chie. It's weird to see Kaoru acting like such a leader.\r\nChie: Did Team Onee-sans get to her after all?\r\nEllen: I don't really know. It's not like she's guaranteed to get the time off if she works harder...\r\nEllen: But, I do think it's good she's getting so involved!\r\nChie: I agree. We have to follow the example she's setting!\r\nEllen: Of course! Whether it's the preparation or the main event, let's make it as fun as we can!\r\n\r\nKaoru: ...Nene. I'm trying hard at getting things set up, right?\r\nNene: Nene-!\r\nKaoru: And everyone can tell, right?\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nKaoru: Then... Everything should be ready. If the time off won't come to me... I've gotta go to it.\r\n\r\nKaoru: Hey, Mihono... You got a minute?\r\nMihono: What's up, Kaoru-san?\r\nKaoru: I wanted to ask you something... If, during the raffle competition, you get the time off... Could you give it to me?\r\nKaoru: Of course, if there's something else you wanted, I'll give it to you if I get it. All I want is that time off.\r\nKaoru: So... Please!\r\nMihono: You've been working so hard getting things ready, Kaoru-san... So sure!\r\nMihono: If I get the time off, I'll give it to you!\r\nKaoru: (...Just as planned!)\r\n\r\nKaoru: And Chie and Mai agreed. Too easy. Ah! Heyyy, Ellen!\r\nEllen: Kaoru-! What is it?\r\nKaoru: If you get the time off from the raffle competition, give it to me.\r\nEllen: ...Oh, so that's what you've been up to. This is why you were helping so much with the preparations, right?\r\nEllen: You planned to show everyone how hard you were working, making it easier to convince them to give you their time off!\r\nKaoru: Sure did. Got a problem with it? I'm not taking any chances with that time off.\r\nKaoru: It's not like it's guaranteed, but... With seven people, one of them is bound to get it.\r\nEllen: Somehow, I'm relieved to see you acting more like yourself! How about this... If you get the all-you-can-eat dessert buffet, then it's win-win for both of us, right?\r\nKaoru: No problem. Is that negotiations settled?\r\nEllen: I think so. So then, who are you going to ask next?\r\nKaoru: Kanami... Wait, are you coming too?\r\nEllen: Yes! It sounds like fun, so I'll join you!\r\n\r\nKanami: Time off? Sure!\r\nKaoru: Thanks, Kanami.\r\nKanami: In exchange, I'd be happy if you had a sparring session with me!\r\nKaoru: Well, that's about what I expected. I don't really want to, but... If that's what it takes.\r\nKanami: Then, let's go right now!\r\nKaoru: ...Huh? Are you serious!?\r\nKanami: We have plenty spare time, so we can fight all we want, Kaoru-chan!\r\nEllen: ...Kanamin loves a good fight after all! Ooh, I thought up something good... Now I'm looking forward to the main event!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: The Raffle Competition Begins!\r\n\r\nOn the day of the End of the School Year Recognition Party--\r\n\r\nSuzuka: With that, we will now begin the raffle competition.\r\nMai: To start, as members of the executive committee, Setouchi-san, Hashi-san, and I will be overseeing the competition.\r\nChie: Sorry, Hashi-san, for making you do so much committee work.\r\nKeiko: N-No, it's fine... I'll do what I can!\r\nMihono: Alright! Me and Kanami will... Wait, where's Kanami!?\r\nEllen: Kanamin went running off as soon as it started.\r\nMihono: Uwaaah! Where'd you go, Kanami-!?\r\nKaoru: Guess I should get going too. Let's show 'em what we've got, Nene.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nEllen: Whoa there, hold on a moment, Kaoru!\r\nKaoru: Nn? What do you want?\r\nEllen: A hachimanriki surprise attack!\r\nKaoru: -! Kongoushin!\r\nEllen: Oh! Nicely blocked, Kaoru!\r\nKaoru: Don't give me that. The hell are you doing, attacking me out of nowhere?\r\nEllen: Isn't it obvious... Kaoru, let's fight!\r\nKaoru: Ugh... No way!\r\nKaoru: Why should I fight you! We don't get anything out of fighting other committee members!\r\nEllen: Kanamin's request for you gave me an idea...\r\nEllen: A fight between best friends, with the raffle tickets on the line... Doesn't it get you fired up!\r\nKaoru: That's your reason!?\r\nEllen: That's all the reason I need!\r\nEllen: And of course, if you don't fight me, forget about me giving you that time off!\r\nKaoru: That's playing dirty!\r\nEllen: That's a compliment to me!\r\nKaoru: We've got committee work to do too, so I wanted to get as much as I could now... You better not regret this later!\r\nEllen: That's it! That's what I was looking for! Now you're getting into it!\r\nKaoru: Tch! RRRYAAA!\r\nEllen: Whoops, you're not going to hit me like that!\r\nKaoru: That's what... You think!\r\nEllen: Wow!\r\nKaoru: Now... We're done here!\r\nEllen: ...!\r\nToji A: You're wide open! HAAAAAAH!!\r\nKaoru: A sneak attack!?\r\nToji B: You better be ready, Kohagura Ellen!\r\nEllen: There's one after me too! Kaoru, let's have a ceasefire while we beat them!\r\nKaoru: Yeah, after we deal with you two, we can finish what we started!\r\n\r\nKaoru: Just kidding.\r\nEllen: Huh!? Kaoru-? Where'd you go, Kaoru... Wah!?\r\nKaoru: I saw my chance and took it. Those two should be able to keep Ellen busy for a while.\r\nNene: Ne-?\r\nKaoru: Don't worry about her. I've seriously gotta make up for lost time now.\r\nKaoru: Let's get straight to collecting tickets.\r\nChie: Kaoru-san! You came at a good time!\r\nKaoru: ...I don't like the look of this, Nene.\r\nNene: Ne.\r\nMai: A few people were injured over here! Come help us move them to the infirmary, Kaoru-chan!\r\nKaoru: I knew it-! Just let me get raffle tickets-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Who Will Lady Luck Favor?\r\n\r\nKaoru: I didn't get any tickets at all... They're working the committee to death...\r\nEllen: Don't worry about it, Kaoru! Even if you don't have a whole lot, I'm sure you'll still pull something good!\r\nKaoru: Hey, don't act like this isn't your fault. Who's the one who held me up right at the start?\r\nEllen: But wasn't it a lot of fun, fighting each other seriously?\r\nKeiko: U-Um... Was it alright for me to receive a dress too?\r\nKeiko: I didn't draw a dress from the raffle...\r\nKaoru: Kanami said it was fine, so there's nothing to worry about.\r\nKaoru: But still, you had some crazy luck with your draws.\r\nKeiko: I can use the cafeteria ticket, though I don't know what to do with the club funding and day with the elite guard.\r\nKeiko: And... I'm sure I used up all my life's luck here...\r\nEllen: You still have plenty more luck ahead of you, Hajihaji!\r\nEllen: Speaking of which, is Kanamin still not done with the raffle?\r\nKeiko: Ah, yes, she was halfway finished with all her draws when I last saw her.\r\nKeiko: I want to thank Etou-san for the dress, but... I don't think I can do it just yet.\r\nMihono: And, from the half she got, most of them were dresses. It's pretty crazy how many of them are in there.\r\nMihono: Kanami could totally open a dress store after this!\r\nMai: What did you get from the raffle, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Listen to this, Mai~. Things were going good at first, but the second half of my draws were a total bust~.\r\nMihono: And whenever I won something from the raffle, it was all dresses too... How'd you do, Mai?\r\nMai: Actually... I won the all-you-can-eat desserts!\r\nEllen: I'm so jealous, Maimai!\r\nKaoru: ...So Mai didn't get the time off either.\r\nKanami: I'm back.\r\nMihono: Hey, Kanami! Here, I got a drink for you!\r\nKanami: Thanks, Mihono-chan. ...Phew, that hits the spot.\r\nKeiko: U-Um, Etou-san, this dress, thank you for giving it to me...!\r\nKanami: Don't mention it. I got the swordfight ticket, so I'm feeling generous!\r\nMihono: Ooh! Congrats, Kanami!\r\nKaoru: ...I was betting on Kanami to get the time off, but that didn't work out either...\r\nKaoru: Guess I really have to do it myself.\r\nEllen: So you're finally taking your shot, Kaoru...!\r\nKaoru: Yeah... I only have this one ticket, but... I'll bet everything on it!\r\n\r\nChie: Oh, Kaoru-san. Are you here to try your luck?\r\nKaoru: Hope it hasn't been too hard working the raffle. Did anybody get the time off yet?\r\nChie: Don't worry, it's still in there. Go on, give it a draw, Kaoru-san.\r\nKaoru: Ahh... It must be my fate to pull it now.\r\nKaoru: ...Hah!\r\nChie: Congratulations, Kaoru-san! You won the opportunity to monitor the Storm Armor test!\r\nKaoru: Monitoring... Am I gonna have to do this on top of my normal missions...\r\nEllen: How'd it go, Kaoru?\r\nKaoru: For now... I'm just going to eat.\r\nEllen: Uh oh, it can't be good news then. Kaoru, maybe changing into your dress will make you feel better~.\r\nKaoru: I didn't get a dress.\r\nEllen: That's alright! I thought you might not, so I asked Kanamin for one!\r\n\r\nKaoru: Sigh, I can't do this. If I don't eat, I can't do this.\r\nSana: Are you having a good time?\r\nKaoru: Geh, it's the ha... the president.\r\nSana: What was that you almost called me just now?\r\nKaoru: Y-You're just hearing things?\r\nKaoru: A-Anyway, it's alright. The food's pretty good at this party.\r\nSana: Good, eat up then. Tomorrow, you've got work to do in Kyushu.\r\nKaoru: Huh?\r\nEllen: There you go again, Kaoru! You're so loved by your job!\r\nKaoru: Is that supposed to make me feel better-!? Bring me another plate-!\r\nKanami: Ah, I can go get that.\r\nKaoru: Great, thanks.\r\nKeiko: ...Um, did your raffle not go well?\r\nKaoru: Yeah, I got Storm Armor monitoring duty.\r\nKaoru: I work my ass off getting the raffle competition ready, and all I get is work in Kyushu and with Storm Armor! If I don't eat my fill here, I can't go on like this!\r\nEllen: Nice thinking, Kaoru!\r\nEllen: You have to makes sure the Storm Armor Hajihaji does maintenance on gets a good testing!\r\nKeiko: R-Right! I'm glad it's going to be someone I know helping me!\r\nKaoru: There's nothing nice about this.\r\nKaoru: If everybody did the raffle and nobody got the time off, then we should've worked on the rates some more!\r\nMihono: But this just means there's jobs that need your help! Right, Mai?\r\nMai: That's true; you must have a higher calling, Kaoru-san.\r\nKaoru: And I'm not happy about it! Somebody, just give me some time offff!"}, {"paste_key": "yuUfiPFL", "title": "Crystal Recovery!

We brought you a filling meal, so please rest a while.\r\nSuzuka: Would you look at that, omusubi and karaage.\r\nYume: They're both really good, Suzuka-onee-san.\r\nYume: But still, who decided on omusubi and karaage anyway? They could've gone with something like roast beef or pizza.\r\nSuzuka: Who could it have been, I wonder?\r\nSuzuka: ...My, they really are delicious. This omusubi tastes like the sort you make, Yomi-san.\r\nYomi: It might have been out of line, but I did offer some advice to the staff.\r\nSuzuka: While you were working as party security?\r\nYomi: I'm very sorry. I couldn't help myself...\r\nSuzuka: There's no reason to apologize. It's thanks to you that I'm able to eat such delicious omusubi now.\r\nYume: That's right-!\r\nYume: I got really hungry while I was doing security, so I ate way too much.\r\nSuzuka: You were a great help with how seriously you decided to take your security role, Yume.\r\nYume: There's something a little off about how you said that.\r\nYume: Were you thinking that I'd stop helping with security and force my way into the raffle competition?\r\nSuzuka: Was I wrong in thinking it a possibility?\r\nSuzuka: I had made arrangements with the girls organizing the entertainment to deal with such an incident, if the need arose, but I'm thankful it didn't.\r\nYume: You did!?\r\nYume: Does that mean, if I'd forced my way in, I'd have gotten to fight that Chidori-onee-san!?\r\nYume: Well I should have done it then-!\r\nYomi: Though, the raffle competition was only able to be safely carried out because you were suppressing any aradama, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nSuzuka: I'm proud of you, Yume.\r\nYume: I didn't really do anything worth praising me for. Those aradama were so weak and all.\r\nSuzuka: Still... There were quite a lot more reports of aradama suppression than we initially expected.\r\nYomi: Could they have been drawn to something?\r\nSuzuka: The aradama, you mean?\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nSuzuka: It's true that... In the past, we have identified aradama that have shown certain attachments to something or another...\r\nYume: What if the aradama wanted to do the raffle too?\r\nYomi: It may not have been the raffle. Large amounts of food and dresses were also prepared here.\r\nSuzuka: That's right, and there is one more item...\r\nKiyoka: Th-Th-There's trouble!\r\nHiyori: Large amounts of aradama have broken into the campus!\r\nSuzuka: Calm down! Has it affected the party?\r\nHiyori: There's no problem there. But, the aradama seem to be taking any kind of jewelry they find.\r\nSuzuka: Could it be... The crystal jewelry adorned on the tiaras!?\r\nYomi: Tiaras? Why would that...\r\nYume: Who cares about why!\r\nYume: I'm all full now, so I could use some exercise.\r\nHiyori: What should we do, Konohana Suzuka?\r\nSuzuka: That goes without saying.\r\nSuzuka: Those of us here will neutralize the aradama, and recover those jewels!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Afterparty in an Uproar! Epilogue\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Good work, all of you.\r\nSuzuka: Thanks to your efforts, we've recovered the jewelry.\r\nYomi: Konohana-san. You said something about a tiara...\r\nSuzuka: That's right... I suppose the best introduction would be to show you all the items in question.\r\nSuzuka: Come this way.\r\n\r\nYume: Uwah! Did you bring all these tiaras here, Suzuka-onee-san?\r\nSuzuka: Yes, of course.\r\nKiyoka: They're so pretty... These... They're real, aren't they?\r\nHiyori: There's so many of them... Enough for everyone? Why though?\r\nSuzuka: So the toji, who are so used to fighting, might have a chance to pretty themselves up.\r\nSuzuka: And, if we're giving them a taste of another world, there's no harm in going all out, is there?\r\nYume: Ooh ooh! Suzuka-onee-san! I wanna wear a tiara!\r\nSuzuka: Thanks to all your efforts, we can distribute these to everyone.\r\nSuzuka: Here you are, Yume.\r\nYume: Ahaha! How do I look, Yomi-onee-san?\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, if you move around too much, it will slip... It is slipping off.\r\nYume: Eh, it is!?\r\nYomi: Please stay still for a moment. I will put it back in place.\r\nYomi: ...That should do it.\r\nYume: Thanks, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nSuzuka: Next is you, Yomi-san.\r\nYomi: I'm fine without a tiara. It's easier to move without one on.\r\nSuzuka: That won't do.\r\nSuzuka: These tiara will be handed out to every toji. What would they think if one of the executive committee wasn't wearing one?\r\nYume: Yeah! We never get a chance like this, so you've gotta put one on!\r\nYume: I know it'd look good on you, Yomi-onee-san.\r\nYomi: ...If you say so. Please go ahead, Konohana-san.\r\nSuzuka: Gladly... Fufu, just as Yume said, it's a natural fit on you, Yomi-san.\r\nYomi: ...Thank you very much.\r\nSuzuka: Sorry to keep you waiting, Juujou-san, Musumi-san.\r\nHiyori: Why me too!?\r\nKiyoka: Thank you so much!\r\nSuzuka: Despite you both being from the same Heijou, your reactions are quite different, aren't they?\r\nHiyori: Of course; we're two different people! Since you gave it to me, doesn't that mean I can do whatever I want with it now?\r\nSuzuka: If you're that opposed to it, then there's nothing I can do.\r\nKiyoka: Ehh, you're taking it off, Juujou-san?\r\nHiyori: A cute tiara like that doesn't look right on someone like me.\r\nHiyori: This sort of thing is better off on a girl like you, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: That's not true! With that gorgeous and glossy hair of yours, that tiara looks perfect on you!\r\nHiyori: Y-You think so?\r\nKiyoka: I know so! And besides, when everyone's wearing a tiara, it would be a shame if you weren't too!\r\nHiyori: Oh, right, everyone will be getting one of these soon. If I'd just have to put it on again... Well, I guess I can leave it like this.\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, you seem to have taken an interest in it. I made the right choice, having these tiaras ready.\r\nSuzuka: Now then, to give these presents out to all the toji, just for tonight."}, {"paste_key": "Vu6cB0fr", "title": "4-1 The Raging Thunder God", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/Vu6cB0fr", "timestamp": "", "hits": "114", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/zFROD5TpIZc\r\n\r\n1: Uncontrollable (1)\r\n\r\nNight, at Kashima Shrine. Etou Kanami has finally reached her destination. However, Juujou Hiyori--\r\n\r\nHiyori: Kanami...\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan! Why are you...\r\nYukari: This was likely Ichikishimahime's will. She wished to be absorbed by Juujou rather than Tagitsuhime. And, in doing so, Juujou has obtained the strength to repel Tagitsuhime.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan...? We can talk everything over later. Let's just go back to the others, okay?\r\nHiyori: Stay back...!\r\nMihono: Kanami, don't!!\r\nKanami: Ah...!\r\nHiyori: ...Please... stay away.\r\nKanami: Why?\r\nHiyori: Right now... In an instant... I saw myself cutting you apart... Again and again...\r\nKanami: What...?\r\nYukari: The future sight given by the dragon's eye. Ichikishimahime within you is showing you predictions of possible futures.\r\nHiyori: Grgh... Aghh...!\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan, is it hurting you?\r\nHiyori: GH, GHHAAGGHHHH---!!\r\nMihono: She's coming! Get ready, Kanami!!\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Uncontrollable (2)\r\n\r\nKanami: Are you okay, Hiyori-chan!?\r\nHiyori: Rrgh...! Urghhh...\r\nHiyori: GYAAAAAAGH---!!\r\nMihono: She's gone!?\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan!\r\nYukari: Don't give chase! Etou, Asakura. The two of you will go back and report this to Sana. And prepare for Tagitsuhime's next attack.\r\nKanami: But, Hiyori-chan's...\r\nYukari: I'll go. If you went, you wouldn't be able to do anything for her.\r\nYukari: What Juujou needs now is an understanding of how to control the aradama. I can give her that.\r\nYukari: Am I clear?\r\nKanami: ............Yes ma'am...\r\nMihono: Kanami...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Panicked Feelings, Worsening Feelings\r\n\r\nThe night turns into morning. At a temporary outpost constructed near Kashima's industrial district--\r\n\r\nSana: You should all get some rest.\r\nKanami: I feel fine. Please, send me out to help look for Hiyori-chan!\r\nSana: Not a chance. Take a break so you can stay in peak condition. You girls are indispensable to us.\r\nKanami: Tagitsuhime will target Hiyori-chan now that she's fused with Ichikishimahime! I have to protect her!\r\nMai: Kanami-chan...\r\nSana: You think you're the only one capable of doing that?\r\nKanami: That's not what I meant...\r\nEllen: This isn't like you, Kanamin. Let's just rest for now, so you can calm down some.\r\nKaoru: Yep. You've gotta recover before a boss fight.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nSana: You can count on us for finding Juujou. The bureau director went after her too, didn't she?\r\nKanami: ...She did.\r\nSana: So, right now, you need a break. That's an order.\r\nKaoru: Right... Oh yeah. Ex-elite guard. We owe you for helping to look for Hiyori.\r\nKaoru: But, don't think that means you're off the hook for what you did to Mokusa. Especially you, shorty.\r\nYume: It's not like you're any taller than me, you know.\r\nEllen: Please don't forget there are still people from Mokusa who haven't forgiven you, Yumecchi.\r\nYume: ...I don't really care if they forgive me anyway.\r\nSana: Could you cut that out? You're supposed to be resting, so don't go doing anything to get in the way of it. I'm leaving things to you, Yanase.\r\nMai: Yes ma'am.\r\n\r\nMaki: Director?\r\nSana: You three rest too. The situation as it is, I'll need to rely on you as well.\r\nMaki: Is there still no sign of Yomi?\r\nSana: I haven't heard any reports as of now.\r\nSuzuka: Even Yomi-san couldn't be in good shape with those wounds.\r\nSana: Satsuki Yomi had been injected with an unusual amount of aradama. I'd like to save her if we can, but... It would be best to think of her as under Tagitsuhime's control now.\r\nSuzuka: No, we cannot say that for sure. She seemed... to be acting under some great conviction of her own.\r\nSuzuka: It wasn't given to her by anyone else. I can only imagine it as Yomi-san's own will.\r\nSana: Then why has she been fighting for all this time?\r\nSuzuka: That's not clear yet...\r\nYume: You don't have to worry. I'll beat Tagitsuhime! And I'll save Yomi-onee-san!\r\nMaki: I'm glad we can count on you.\r\nYume: The elite guard is all four of us together! We can't just leave Yomi-onee-san out!\r\nMaki: Right, we won't. That's the spirit, Yume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: What Happens Now (1)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, with the investigation team, the members of [YOUR NAME HERE] were--\r\n\r\nKiyoka: What exactly should we be doing from now on?\r\nMirja: That's a good question. Let's share what we know and put our situation in order.\r\nMirja: Currently, the STT and JSDF are giving all their efforts to locate the missing Juujou Hiyori and Origami Yukari.\r\nChie: Juujou-san fused with Ichikishimahime to defeat Tagitsuhime, didn't she?\r\nMihono: Yeah. It was crazy... I couldn't believe how strong she got. She was moving so fast my eyes couldn't keep up at all.\r\nMihono: If Kanami and Yukari-sama weren't there, I'd...\r\nKofuki: She's good enough already, and now she's combined with the great aradama... I wish I'd been there to see it.\r\nChie: Still, while I'm worried about Juujou-san, we need to search for an okatana capable of defeating the great aradama, don't we.\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie is correct. That was the original objective of this investigation team. We cannot disregard it now.\r\nKofuki: But still. You really think something that convenient would just have one or two more lying around?\r\nKiyoka: We went through a lot just finding Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu.\r\nChie: We don't even know if there are more of them, so you're right, it's a bit like trying to catch lightning in a bottle.\r\nMirja: Does an okatana capable of suppressing the great aradama still exist? In our situation, we need to start by finding proof of it.\r\nMirja: Although, whatever action we now take will depend on the decisions of our superiors. We simply need to carry out whatever orders they assign us.\r\nKofuki: Well, I'm fine with anything so long as I get to have some fun with aradama-chan.\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie. We will very likely be cooperating with the elite guard in the future. Will that be alright?\r\nChie: You don't have to worry about me. I understand just how capable Tsubakuro-san is. And how much we need her. So long as it's for our mission, I know we have to work with her.\r\nMirja: I see.\r\nMihono: We've gotta save Yui and Hana too! Even if our mission is important too!\r\nMirja: It goes without saying, they won't be forgotten. Rescuing them is a priority of mine as well. If a chance arises, we won't let it pass.\r\nChie: The problem is whether or not we can undo their brainwashing.\r\nKiyoka: It seemed like it had a strong hold over them...\r\nKofuki: We don't have to worry about that till after we catch 'em.\r\nMihono: Yeah! After we get them back, I'm sure we can figure something out! Where there's a will, there's a way!\r\nMirja: Now then, until orders arrive, each of you wait on standby. Be sure to get all the rest you need.\r\nMirja: However, the continued suppression of aradama is a part of our duties as well. It's possible we may be suddenly called to action, so please do not relax your guard.\r\n\r\nYuzuki: Kitora, do you have a moment?\r\nMirja: Of course, what do you need?\r\nYuzuki: Take this with you.\r\nMirja: An ampoule? What is--\r\nAnnouncement: Aradama have appeared in the area. Toji should move to intercept at once. I repeat--\r\nMirja: Please excuse me. Our conversation will have to be put on hold to suppress these aradama.\r\nYuzuki: Right. Best of luck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: What Happens Now (2)\r\n\r\nKofuki: What, that's all of them already? I was thinking I'd get to have way more fun here!\r\nChie: You sure are full of energy, Kofuki-chan. This sudden mission has me feeling bushed.\r\nKiyoka: I-I feel the same...\r\nMirja: Mission accomplished. Everyone, withdraw at once.\r\nMihono: C'mon, let's head back! And when we get there, we've gotta eat a big breakfast!\r\nMirja: The ampoule that President Souraku gave me. I was unable to ask her what it was for.\r\nMirja: President Souraku is very busy as well. Hopefully I can find a chance to speak with her again...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Emotions with No Outlet (1)\r\n\r\nHiyori: Haa... Haah...... Grh...\r\nHiyori: Origami... Yukari...!\r\nYukari: Are you suffering?\r\nHiyori: Isn't it ironic... You used to be possessed by the great aradama... And I was the one trying to kill you...\r\nHiyori: Now, I'm the aradama.\r\nYukari: Now that it's come to this, Juujou, you must destroy Tagitsuhime.\r\nHiyori: That's what... I always planned on doing...\r\nYukari: .........\r\nHiyori: Stop! Don't take another step towards me!\r\nYukari: How many times did you kill me in your future sight just now? Across various exchanges, you must have cut me down in every possible way.\r\nHiyori: Ggh...!\r\nYukari: Though, I doubt even that would clear away the hatred you bear toward me.\r\nHiyori: Urgh... AGHHHGGHHH!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Emotions with No Outlet (2)\r\n\r\nHiyori: Khgh...\r\nYukari: Don't be swallowed up in the aradama! Hold firmly onto yourself!\r\nHiyori: Ah-!\r\nYukari: Listen, Juujou Hiyori. You have inherited the power of the Hiiragi family from Kagari. It is the very same power that we, the Origami family, have.\r\nHiyori: ...What are you talking about?\r\nYukari: The Origamis suppress the aradama. Your family, the Hiiragis, are the ones who exorcise them. The relationship between us could be considered two sides of the same coin.\r\nHiyori: What...!?\r\nYukari: Even among toji, we are the families closest to special aradama. It was this power that allowed you to fuse with Ichikishimahime.\r\nHiyori: ...Then, why!? If we're the same, why was it only a Hiiragi... Why did my mother have to give her life, instead of an Origami, to suppress an aradama!?\r\nHiyori: How can I accept something that unreasonable!?\r\nHiyori: And still... Damn it...! Because of Ichikishimahime, I know!\r\nHiyori: You truly wanted to free my mother from that unreasonable duty! To save our mothers, you offered yourself to Tagitsuhime--\r\nHiyori: But then what!?\r\nHiyori: If nobody's to blame, what do I do!? With this anger in me... With my mother's regret...\r\nYukari: Destroy Tagitsuhime. After she is defeated, absorb her into yourself and become an evil god.\r\nHiyori: Become... an evil god...?\r\nYukari: Do that, and I will bring an end to everything.\r\nHiyori: ............\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Master's Words\r\n\r\nKanami: [snooze]...\r\nSayaka: Kanami fell asleep right away...\r\nMai: She must have been exhausted after all.\r\nKanami: [snooze]......\r\nMai: But, from the look on her sleeping face, she must be enjoying herself. Like she's having a nice dream.\r\n\r\nKanami: Owww...\r\nMinato: Okay. That makes 7 to 3; it's my win!\r\nKanami: Ahaha... You sure are strong, Master.\r\nMinato: But you're pretty good yourself, Kanami. You managed to get 3 points against me.\r\nMinato: ...So? What's bugging you this time?\r\nKanami: Eh...?\r\n\r\nMinato: Hmm, Hiyori-chan fused with an aradama?\r\nKanami: Mm... I was right with her, but I couldn't stop it. She'd been acting a little weird since before the mission.\r\nKanami: I'm sure she was thinking, as things kept getting worse, she had to do something...\r\nMinato: Well, what's done is done. You can't blame yourself.\r\nMinato: You sure are kind, Kanami. You're kind, and you care about your friends. But you're cold and self-centered.\r\nKanami: Don't those contradict each other?\r\nKanami: They do. But, isn't the world of swordfighting like that?\r\nKanami: It is......?\r\nMinato: When you use a sword, you want to be stronger; to master it.\r\nMinato: But, you defeat opponent after opponent, and after you've beaten everyone, you find yourself all alone.\r\nMinato: Swordfighting doesn't work without an opponent, after all.\r\nMinato: Right now, you've gotten strong, Kanami. Strong enough that nobody on that side can be your opponent anymore. That's why you're always looking lonely.\r\nMinato: But it's fine to feel that way. You should have those kinds of worries.\r\nMinato: When you're holding something dangerous like an okatana, you have to be thinking about stuff like that.\r\nKanami: Okay...\r\nMinato: What matters most is how you're kind and care about your friends. No doubt about it, you're a good kid, Kanami. Your parents must've been amazing people.\r\nKanami: Isn't that you?\r\nMinato: I- keep- telling- you-, that's not who I am. If anything, that'd be... the future me?\r\nKanami: ...Yeah. She was an amazing mom.\r\nMinato: I bet. I mean, she's me and all.\r\nKanami: When you're like that, you're just like her.\r\n\r\nKanami: .........That's weird? I feel all full of energy now!\r\nKanami: ...Alright-! I'm gonna bring Hiyori-chan back, no matter what!\r\n\r\nSana: I see you're all here.\r\nKanami: What about Hiyori-chan!? Have you found where she is?\r\nSana: I still haven't gotten anything back from the search team. You'll all be forming a unit yourselves and taking up the search. Yanase will be in charge.\r\nMai: Yes ma'am.\r\nEllen: With the way Hiyoyon is now, our spectrum finders or even Nene could track her down.\r\nNene: Nene-!\r\nKaoru: So then, let's get going!\r\nKanami: ...Just wait for us, Hiyori-chan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: Hiyori Search Order (1)\r\n\r\nMirja: Director Maniwa, you called for us?\r\nSana: Right, I have new orders for you. Your investigation team will also be joining the search for Juujou Hiyori, whose whereabouts are currently unknown.\r\nMirja: Understood.\r\nMihono: That's great! I'm worried about Yui and Hana, but Juujou-san is in trouble too. We can't leave her alone now!\r\nKofuki: We might get to run into her now that she's combined with the great aradama. I can't wait to see that!\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan...?\r\nKofuki: I-I got it, okay! It's just a search mission! I'm not gonna do anything to screw it up!\r\nKiyoka: Really...? When it comes to aradama, you start acting funny. I'm a little concerned.\r\nKofuki: I said it'll be fine! Have a little faith... C'mon.\r\nSana: The elite guard, along with Kanami the others, are also out looking for Juujou. If you need to, work together to carry out your mission.\r\nMirja: Yes ma'am!\r\nSana: Now then, the investigation team--\r\nSana: What was that?\r\nAnnouncement: Aradama have appeared in the area. Toji should move to intercept at once. I repeat--\r\nSana: Figures. Sorry, but could you girls take care of the aradama around here first?\r\nKofuki: Like you have to ask. No way I'm not going. Nobody's taking my aradama-chan.\r\nSana: As soon as you're done suppressing them, move straight into searching for Juujou. There's no need for you to return here.\r\nMirja: Understood. We will now proceed to suppress the aradama!\r\nKofuki: Hell yeah! Wait for me, my sweet aradama-chan!\r\nSana: If only Kaoru could show some of that enthusiasm...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: Hiyori Search Order (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Okaaay! Suppression's taken care of!\r\nKofuki: But this is where the real action starts, yeah?\r\nMirja: Juujou Hiyori in her current state is capable of defeating Tagitsuhime. We need to secure her as quickly as possible.\r\nChie: That's right. I doubt Tagitsuhime will leave Juujou-san alone either, so we have to find her before it's too late.\r\nKiyoka: Mmhm. Let's hurry, everyone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: God of Evil (1)\r\n\r\nHiyori: .........\r\nYukari: ...Good. It may be difficult, but you seem to be able to control it.\r\nHiyori: ...Ggh!\r\nYukari: So she came...\r\nTagitsuhime: Now then...\r\nTagitsuhime: Let the final battle begin.\r\n\r\nMai: You know, earlier.\r\nKanami: Huh?\r\nMai: I spoke to President Hashima.\r\nMai: She said, looking at you and Hiyori-chan, you reminded her of your mothers... Of Minato-san and Kagari-san.\r\nKanami: My mom? Oh, right, though I'm not really sure about myself. I wonder if Hiyori-chan is a lot like her mom then.\r\nMai: I think it's true. The president was always by their side, watching them.\r\nKanami: That's right, she was my mom's classmate, wasn't she--\r\nKanami: It's getting a reaction! And it's a big one! It has to be Hiyori-chan!\r\n\r\nTagitsuhime: Well now... Not only clad in lightning, but the speed and weight of your strikes has dramatically grown.\r\nTagitsuhime: Merging with her may have considerably raised your potential... But surely you don't think that enough to defeat me?\r\nTagitsuhime: All you have done is gained Ichikishimahime's power. While I, by absorbing Takirihime, have greatly amplified my own.\r\nYukari: Don't be fooled, Juujou! Right now, you're stronger than Tagitsuhime!\r\nTagitsuhime: Pure nonsense.\r\nYukari: When two aradama combine, it's nothing more than simple addition. She doesn't have nearly as much noro as she did half a year ago.\r\nTagitsuhime: You cast off husk... The most you can do is bark away from the side.\r\nYukari: But the fusion of toji and aradama gives a multiplicative return. A form of scientific reaction occurs.\r\nYukari: And what's more, Juujou. You have the unique properties inherited from your mother. Tagitsuhime fears you!\r\nTagitsuhime: Are you aware I am a god?\r\nYukari: An evil god.\r\nTagitsuhime: A god is immortal.\r\nYukari: Conceptually, a god may be immortal. But what you are is nothing more than an aradama imitating life.\r\nYukari: Cut down and exorcise the aradama, Juujou!\r\nHiyori: HAAAAAAAAHHH-!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: God of Evil (2)\r\n\r\nTagitsuhime: I see, you are fast. However...\r\nHiyori: Pant... Pant...\r\nTagitsuhime: With that much power...\r\nTagitsuhime: It must be a strain on your body.\r\nHiyori: Grgh...!\r\nYukari: The dragon's eye's future sight. With both of them reading each other's moves through it, the fight stays a draw.\r\nYukari: Put all your strength into your attacks!!\r\nHiyori: UAAAAAARGH!!\r\nTagitsuhime: Grh... You...!!\r\nTagitsuhime: Urgh...!\r\nYukari: The blade of Kogarasumaru is fatal.\r\nTagitsuhime: Yukari, damn you... I ignored you for the husk you are, but now you are an eyesore... Die!\r\nYukari: Heh......\r\nTagitsuhime: You could still use utsushi!?\r\nHiyori: HAAAAAAA-!!\r\nTagitsuhime: Ghah...\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan!\r\nYukari: Excellent, Juujou. That is the form of coexistence between mankind and aradama that Ichikishimahime envisioned.\r\nYukari: You are the embodiment of it.\r\nKanami: ...What's going on?\r\nYukari: Juujou... Has defeated Tagitsuhime.\r\nKanami: What...?\r\nYukari: And... By taking them all into her body... Juujou--\r\nYukari: Has become an evil god.\r\nKanami: ...!\r\nSayaka: What is... this feeling?\r\nKaoru: Yeah, something's not right.\r\nMai: Is that... Hiyori-chan?\r\nEllen: Kanamin! Be careful!\r\nHiyori: Kanami...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13: Your Feelings Piling Up (1)\r\n\r\nAt that time, with the investigation team--\r\n\r\nKiyoka: The spectrum finder isn't detecting anything.\r\nKofuki: Damnit, where'd Hiyori even run off to?\r\nMirja: The readings from Juujou Hiyori after fusing with Ichikishimahime should be incomparable to that of a standard aradama.\r\nMirja: For it to be unable to detect her could only mean we aren't within enough range.\r\nKofuki: For real, how much longer are we gonna have to walk? Especially out here on this mountain.\r\nKofuki: Wait, do we even know she's still around here? Couldn't she have gone off somewhere else already?\r\nChie: We can't rule that out, but with no other information, we'll just have to continue searching by foot.\r\nKofuki: So that's what it comes down to.\r\nKiyoka: But, thinking about how Juujou-san must feel, we have to find her soon...\r\nKofuki: Huhh? Why Hiyori instead of Kanami?\r\nKiyoka: It must be hard enough on her after fusing with Ichikishimahime, but they said she can't control it.\r\nKiyoka: Wouldn't it be scary if you didn't know if you would hurt your friends? Wouldn't it feel hopeless for your own strength to be out of your control? Wouldn't you be crushed under your own fears?\r\nKiyoka: You don't want to hurt anyone, but you want someone there with you. If it were me, I know that's how I'd feel. That's why, we have to find Juujou-san quickly.\r\nChie: Kiyoka-chan...\r\nMihono: Don't worry, I know we'll find her right away! I can feel it. We're almost there! Just trust my intuition!\r\nKiyoka: Something showed up on the spectrum finder! It's headed this way.\r\nMihono: See~, look. My intuition was right on the money!\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nMihono: Wait... That's not Juujou-san!\r\nKofuki: Your intuition's gonna go bankrupt at this rate!\r\nChie: And this had to be right when we're in a hurry.\r\nKofuki: They came all the way to see us. We've gotta roll out the red carpet. You're welcome anytime, aradama-chan!\r\nMirja: Everyone, ready for combat!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14: Your Feelings Piling Up (2)\r\n\r\nChie: That should be all of them.\r\nMihono: Then, let's get our heads back in the search for Juujou-san!\r\nMirja: Wait! This call is from headquarters. Everyone, remain on standby.\r\nMirja: This is Kitora. Yes, yes... Yes, I understand. We will convene with them at once.\r\nKofuki: What'd they say?\r\nMirja: It appears they have found Juujou Hiyori. We'll head to the scene immediately!\r\nKiyoka: They found Juujou-san? Thank goodness...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15: Where the Tournament Left Off (1)\r\n\r\nKanami: ...Hiyori-chan?\r\nYukari: Can you hold onto yourself, Juujou...? If you can shut them out, this will all be over.\r\nYukari: If you can't... Then we will go together to the depths of the netherworld.\r\nKanami: Yukari-sama!\r\nHiyori: That's not bad either...\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: I get it... That's what you meant, when you said you'd end everything...\r\nHiyori: You and I are two sides of a coin. Only our sides are flipped this time, aren't they?\r\nHiyori: This time, you're going to throw your life away and fall into the depths of the netherworld with me?\r\nYukari: If you can suppress it, that won't be necessary. But I know full well how difficult that can be.\r\nYukari: Twenty years was all I could manage to contain it for. Maybe it could be different for you.\r\nHiyori: Twenty years, like this...? I don't think that's possible for me.\r\nYukari: Is that so.\r\nHiyori: But, I don't need help from you. I can go myself...\r\nMai: Hiyori-chan!\r\nEllen: Hiyoyon?\r\nSayaka: Let's go back... Hiyori.\r\nKaoru: Oi. I know I'm asking the impossible, but try to deal with it.\r\nHiyori: ...I feel like I could burst at any moment. And if I let this out... a disaster like twenty years ago... no, worse could--\r\nKanami: Hey... Are you strong now, Hiyori-chan?\r\nMai: Kanami-chan...?\r\nKanami: You are, aren't you? After all, you were strong enough to beat Tagitsuhime.\r\nHiyori: .........\r\nKanami: Hey, do you think, right now, we could pick up where we left off at the tournament?\r\nKaoru: Are you out of your mind?\r\nEllen: Kanamin, there's a limit--\r\nKanami: I guess my timing's pretty bad, huh? But I feel like this is the only chance I'll get to face off with Hiyori-chan while she's this strong.\r\nHiyori: Kanami...\r\nKanami: I mean... You're not going to be with us anymore, right?\r\nEllen: Kanamin!\r\nKanami: ...To tell you the truth?\r\nKanami: I've gotten a lot stronger since then. I felt like, if I went all out, I could have wiped the floor with you.\r\nHiyori: You're saying, now that I've become an evil god, we're finally equals?\r\nKanami: Well, I don't know about that?\r\nEllen: Kanamin! That's enough! You're seriously making me angry!\r\nHiyori: ...I'll get to see you going all out, won't I?\r\nKanami: Yeah. I'll give you everything I've got.\r\nEllen: H-Hold on a minute! This is crazy, you two!\r\nHiyori: That's how she's always been. Kind on one side, but--\r\nKanami: Cold and self-centered?\r\nHiyori: That's right.\r\nKanami: (Wait...? Was it Hiyori-chan who told me that?)\r\nHiyori: Don't go thinking this is unfair.\r\nKanami: ...I won't. Using that is just one of your talents. It's just a different tactic than mine.\r\nHiyori: ...That's impossible!?\r\nHiyori: Against Kanami putting all her strength into her sword, I lose in every instance...\r\nYukari: From seeing it with the dragon's eye, I finally understand. Etou's sword accurately reads the three powers of heaven, earth, and man, and instantly forms a fight in response.\r\nYukari: That part of her began blooming that night in Kamakura, and now, it's showing its full potential.\r\nHiyori: This is...\r\nYukari: For Etou, this may be her \"single sword\".\r\nHiyori: HAH-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16: Where the Tournament Left Off (2)\r\n\r\nHiyori: HAAAAAAAHH!!\r\nKanami: .........\r\nMai: She cut...\r\nKaoru: Straight through the lightning...\r\nHiyori: I don't believe it... Even with the power of an evil god...\r\nKanami: Hmm? So you're just going to give up that easily, and get sent to the depths of the netherworld with the aradama?\r\nHiyori: Kanami.........?\r\nKanami: I won't let you...! I'll never...! Let that happen...!\r\nKanami: If you can't hold it in by yourself, then just let it all out! I'll cut it down for you!\r\nKanami: Every last bit of it-- I'll cut it all down!\r\nKanami: Didn't I tell you I'd take half of it too...? Please, just trust me more...!\r\nKanami: [sobbing]\r\nHiyori: Grgh!! Ah... GUAGH...!!\r\nHiyori: AAGGGHHHH!!!\r\nMai: Tagitsuhime!? Why...?\r\nTagitsuhime: You weren't the only one scheming something... Yukari!\r\nHiyori: Gagh...!\r\nTagitsuhime: Now, become one with me.\r\nTagitsuhime: Heh......\r\nEllen: Hiyoyon was absorbed into Tagitsuhime...\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nKanami: ...Hiyori...chan...?\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: Guided by the Lightning\r\n\r\nKofuki: When they said they found Hiyori, this was the way we were supposed to head, right?\r\nMirja: I have GPS confirmation of it. She's in this direction, without a doubt. It shouldn't be much further either.\r\nKiyoka: The spectrum finder is showing a big reaction too!\r\nChie: Hya-!? Wh-What was that...? Was that a lightning strike, right nearby...?\r\nKiyoka: That lightning strike... It's in the same direction the spectrum finder is showing!\r\nMihono: That lightning... I know what that is! That's Juujou-san...! Just like back then!\r\nMihono: Let's hurry, guys! We're almost there!"}, {"paste_key": "s8vgL6wJ", "title": "Hiiragi Kagari Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/s8vgL6wJ", "timestamp": "", "hits": "106", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/1TSJLghLiqQ\r\nhttps://youtu.be/oPPNp9dWijk\r\n\r\n1: Mamekan\r\n\r\nMinato: Yukari, is Kagari in here?\r\nYukari: Minato...\r\nKagari: I'm sure I've told you countless times, this isn't a place for you to goof off... I wish you would remember that, Minato-senpai.\r\nMinato: But I do remember!\r\nMinato: I never said I was here to goof off now, you know.\r\nKagari: ...You're right, I'm sorry. What brings you here today?\r\nMinato: Refreshments! I thought you two might be worn out, so I bought something sweet for you.\r\nYukari: Something sweet... That sounds nice. What did you buy?\r\nMinato: You know that store that people have been talking about lately? The Japanese sweets place.\r\nMinato: They had so much that it was hard to pick, so I went with something simple and got you mamekan.\r\nKagari: ......Mamekan.\r\nYukari: Thank you, Minato. Kagari, it's a little early, but let's take a break.\r\nKagari: ...\r\nYukari: Kagari? Is it too soon for tea?\r\nMinato: Oh, if I'm in the way, then I'll head home. This was really all I stopped by for.\r\nKagari: Ah, n-no! I'll get the tea ready right away, so please, Minato-senpai, you can join us!\r\nMinato: ...Hey, Yukari. Is Kagari acting weird to you?\r\nYukari: She was working like normal until just a moment ago... I wonder why?\r\n\r\nKagari: Chew chew...\r\nMinato: I guess that's why.\r\nYukari: Fufu, it looks very tasty.\r\nKagari: ...? Are you two not going to eat?\r\nMinato: Yeah, I was going to. Cause the way you're eating makes it look so good.\r\nKagari: ...That's because mamekan is delicious.\r\nMinato: You looked real cute while you were eating.\r\nKagari: Wha-!? P-Please stop harassing me, Minato-senpai!\r\nMinato: Ehh, but you really did look cute. Right, Yukari?\r\nKagari: Absolutely not! I wasn't cute, was I, Yukari-sama!\r\nYukari: I thought you were cute.\r\nKagari: N-Not you too, Yukari-sama!\r\nKagari: ...I've had enough! Thank you for the meal!\r\nYukari: Oh, are you on a hunger strike now?\r\nMinato: I bought a whole bunch, so eat all you want, Kagari.\r\nKagari: I won't eat any more!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: A Modest Hobby\r\n\r\nKagari: The assignment is portraiture...?\r\nKagari: (What will I do... I don't know anyone I can ask to pose for me...)\r\nKagari: Sigh...\r\nMinato: What's up, Kagari? I heard you sighing about something.\r\nKagari: Minato-senpai?\r\nKagari: (I could ask Minato-senpai... No, could she be capable of modelling for a long stretch of time?)\r\nKagari: ...It's nothing. What about you, Minato-senpai? Why are you here?\r\nMinato: Your class was assigned to paint portraits, right? I thought I'd let you paint me.\r\nKagari: ...News travels fast, I see. Who told you?\r\nMinato: Just Ema... Anyway, did you find a model yet?\r\nKagari: No, I'm still looking...\r\nMinato: Then this works out perfect!\r\nKagari: ...Do you understand what a model needs to do? You're going to have to hold the same pose for a very long time.\r\nMinato: Easy peasy!\r\nKagari: ...Very well, I'll take your word for it. Please help me out, Minato-senpai.\r\n\r\nKagari: ......\r\nMinato: Hey, Kagari.\r\nKagari: Will the model please be quiet.\r\nMinato: So long as my body doesn't move, it's okay if my mouth moves, right?\r\nKagari: I guess, but...\r\nMinato: Anyway, show me what it's looking like so far.\r\nKagari: It's a work in progress, so no.\r\nMinato: You're so stingy, Kagari.\r\nKagari: This has nothing to do with me being stingy.\r\nKagari: Even if it's you, Minato-senpai, I don't want the model seeing a work I'm not satisfied with.\r\nMinato: You sure are taking this seriously. You love painting that much, huh?\r\nKagari: ...It's a hobby of mine. Why did you think I love painting?\r\nMinato: It's just, while you're painting, you look like you're having a lot of fun.\r\nKagari: ...That aside, please wait until it's complete. I want to be sure it's finished.\r\nMinato: Got it, I'll look forward to it!\r\nKagari: (...I didn't have to tell her that. But...)\r\nMinato: ...\r\nMinato: (If she'll be quiet, then I don't mind.)\r\n\r\nKagari: ...Phew, it's finished.\r\nMinato: Let me see! ...This is how you see me, Kagari? I look way too cool!\r\nKagari: It's not like I did anything to change your appearance. I just captured how you look...\r\nMinato: Who should I show this to first... I know, it's gotta be Yukari!\r\nKagari: That's not something I planned on Yukari-sama seeing... She's gone!\r\nKagari: I don't believe it! Please stop, Minato-senpai!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Distance Between the Two\r\n\r\nKagari: Nn... Where am I...?\r\nEma: [sleeping]\r\nKagari: Ema-senpai?\r\nKagari: (That's right, Yukari-sama told me to take the day off... And I went along with Minato-senpai and Ema-senpai on their hot springs trip...)\r\nEma: Nnn...\r\nKagari: She's sleeping soundly...\r\nKagari: And Minato-senpai... Hm? She's not here...\r\nKagari: I'm wide awake now... I may as well go look for her...\r\n\r\nMinato: Hup! Hup!\r\nKagari: ...Minato-senpai?\r\nMinato: Huh... Kagari? What are you doing up this late?\r\nKagari: That's what I came to ask you. What are you doing out here?\r\nMinato: Practice swings!\r\nMinato: I woke up, and when I looked outside, the moon looks so pretty, doesn't it?\r\nKagari: I agree, it is pretty.\r\nMinato: And just looking at it makes you want to get in some practice swinging, doesn't it?\r\nKagari: That I can't understand... Though I do think it's good not to neglect your training.\r\nMinato: Ahaha. It's rare for you to compliment me.\r\nKagari: I didn't mean to compliment you specifically...\r\nKagari: Anyway, do you mind if I ask you something?\r\nMinato: So long as you don't mind if I keep practicing.\r\nKagari: Why did you invite me to come with you?\r\nMinato: Do you wish I hadn't?\r\nKagari: Yes.\r\nMinato: No hesitation, huh...? But I wanted to go to a hot spring with you, Kagari.\r\nKagari: ...Is that all?\r\nMinato: That's all there is to it. You don't need any other reason to go to a hot spring.\r\nKagari: Minato-senpai... You're a strange person.\r\nMinato: You think so? ...Achoo!\r\nKagari: Alright, come on, let's go back. Things would only get worse if you caught a cold.\r\nMinato: You worry too much, Kagari.\r\nKagari: I am not worried about you.\r\nMinato: Did you have a good time?\r\nKagari: ...Well, I think it made for a good break.\r\nMinato: Is that so. Well, I'm glad to hear it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Like/Dislike\r\n\r\nMinato: Kagari! Do you have any plans next time you have a day off? If not, let's go see a movie together!\r\nKagari: I refuse.\r\nKagari: I have my work to do as Yukari-sama's attendant. Whether I have a day off is irrelevant.\r\nMinato: Oh... That's too bad. I'll ask some other time then.\r\n\r\nMinato: Hey, Kagari! You came at just the right time.\r\nKagari: ...For what?\r\nMinato: See, I was just looking for someone to practice with. Are you free for a while?\r\nMinato: I'm busy.\r\nMinato: Oh, well, I'll ask again later!\r\n\r\nMinato: Kagari--\r\nKagari: I am busy!\r\n\r\nYukari: Fufu, I heard about you two, Kagari. Minato has been following you around, hasn't she?\r\nKagari: She has. \"Are you free now, are you free later\", just who does she think I am?\r\nYukari: Why not join her once in a while?\r\nKagari: Absolutely not! She's irritating enough as she is now; I refuse to spend any more time with her than I have to!\r\nYukari: ...So you don't like Minato then?\r\nKagari: ...\r\nYukari: If it's hard to answer, is that a yes?\r\nKagari: That's right, I don't like her.\r\nYukari: Are you sure?\r\nKagari: ......\r\nKagari: To be honest, I don't think I dislike her... That much.\r\nMinato: You here, Kagari?\r\nKagari: M-Minato-senpai!?\r\nYukari: At least knock before you come in, Minato. It's bad manners.\r\nMinato: Ahaha, my bad, sorry.\r\nKagari: D-Did you...\r\nMinato: Huh?\r\nKagari: Did you hear... Just now?\r\nMinato: Did I hear what... Ah, does that mean you were talking bad about me behind my back?\r\nKagari: ...Oh.\r\nYukari: We weren't. Right, Kagari?\r\nYukari: Right. We were only talking about how irritating you are, Minato-senpai.\r\nMinato: No wait, that's definitely talking bad about me!?\r\nYukari: Pfft, ahahaha!\r\nMinato: I don't get what's so funny about that!?\r\nKagari: Neither do I, Yukari-sama!\r\nYukari: I'm just relieved, since you two seem to be getting along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Start of a Relationship\r\n\r\nRoughly one week after Kagari began attending Renpu Middle School...\r\n\r\nYukari: Kagari, are you getting used to things at school?\r\nKagari: There haven't been any issues.\r\nYukari: There haven't, huh.\r\nYukari: Because I've heard a report you had trouble cooperating with your classmates.\r\nKagari: You did?\r\nKagari: I'm very sorry to have taken up your time. I'll make improvements so you no longer receive any reports.\r\nYukari: Kagari? Doesn't that mean you acknowledge there's been an issue?\r\nKagari: There hasn't, Yukari-sama.\r\nKagari: It's an issue that I've caused an inconvenience for you, however, there isn't an issue with my behavior at school.\r\nYukari: Aren't those the same thing?\r\nKagari: I'm only attending this school to serve you, Yukari-sama. I don't need to familiarize myself with the others.\r\nYukari: (If I told her to make a friend, I'm sure she would, but it's not the kind of thing she should be ordered to do...)\r\nYukari: How exactly do you plan on improving the situation?\r\nKagari: First, with a report to my homeroom teacher. \"I will be fine like this.\"\r\nKagari: That will probably be enough to resolve the issue.\r\nYukari: I see.\r\nYukari: (Kagari would do that too.)\r\nYukari: (She has her duty as a Hiiragi... That must be part of why she keeps others at a distance.)\r\nYukari: (For me to tell her to make friends, when I'm part of the ones responsible...)\r\nYukari: (Even so, I can't leave her like this.)\r\nYukari: If I can't, then surely Minato could guide her in the right direction. [mumbled]\r\nKagari: Yukari-sama? I didn't quite hear that?\r\nYukari: I only meant to say, I want you to meet with my friends shortly.\r\nKagari: I am informed of your friends, so there's no need for me to actually meet with them...\r\nYukari: Then when I meet with them, do you always plan on leaving?\r\nKagari: I... You have a point. I understand.\r\nYukari: Who should you meet first? If I called Minato, I'm sure she could be here now...\r\nKagari: Minato... You must mean Fujiwara Minato-senpai, from the Shikishima Bank Siege incident.\r\nYukari: Oh, you knew that much already?\r\nKagari: It's only natural, as your attendant. There are no problems with her.\r\nYukari: Very well. I'll call her then.\r\n\r\nMinato: Yukari, I'm here! You said there was somebody for me to meet?\r\nKagari: (So this is Fujiwara Minato... She's more ordinary than I expected. I doubt I'll have much to do with her.)\r\nKagari: Nice to meet you, Fujiwara-senpai. My name is--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKagari Joins - Part 1: Even the Devil Gets Heatstroke\r\n\r\nYukari: Cough, cough...\r\nKagari: Your temperature still isn't coming down. How are you feeling, Yukari-sama?\r\nYukari: I told you not to come into the room, Kagari. You can stay away until I've recovered... Cough...\r\nKagari: But, it's my duty to always serve at your side. I could never leave you...\r\nYukari: If you come down with my cold during a critical moment, what will we do? If you understand, then leave.\r\nKagari: I understand...\r\n\r\nKagari: Sigh... Yukari-sama told me not to come near her, but it's not as if I have the day off. I don't know what I should do...\r\nMinato: Oh, Kagari. What's up? What're you doing standing around sighing out here for?\r\nKagari: I wasn't sighing about anything...\r\nMinato: You totally were though. A big one, like \"haaa~\". Wait? Why aren't you with Yukari? She's inside, isn't she?\r\nKagari: She is, though...\r\nMinato: I got my hands on a tasty cake, so I thought we could eat it together. Want to join us, Kagari?\r\nKagari: A cake...? Yukari-sama's body is under a lot of stress right now. With her cold, she has to remain in bed...\r\nMinato: Ehh-!? Yukari actually got sick!? I guess it's like they say, even the devil gets heatstroke, ahaha.\r\nKagari: \"Ahaha\"...? Minato-senpai... Your good friend is in there sick right now. Do you not care at all?\r\nMinato: Of course I care. But, whether I laugh or get upset, it's not going to make her cold go away, is it?\r\nKagari: You aren't wrong, but...\r\nMinato: So, I feel bad for Yukari, but we're going to have to eat this cake with just the two of us.\r\nKagari: No thank you. I could never take something so delicious for myself while Yukari-sama is in there suffering...\r\nMinato: You're looking a little pale, Kagari. Don't tell me, out of consideration for Yukari, you didn't eat anything today?\r\nKagari: I wouldn't call it out of consideration... If the master won't eat her meals, then for her attendant to...\r\nMinato: Come on, if you don't eat, then how can you keep up your energy? Here, stop worrying about that and take a big bite. Say ahh~!\r\nKagari: Mmrgh-! (chew chew)...\r\nKagari: Hey, Minato-senpai! Please don't force things into my mouth!\r\nMinato: See, now you're sounding alive again. It's important making sure you eat properly. It'd be nice if Yukari's cold would go away too...\r\nMinato: Oh hey, I know just the thing!\r\nKagari: What?\r\nMinato: If we cross the mountain behind here, there's a shrine way on the other side that has spring water famous for being able to cure all kinds of diseases. Want to come with me to go bring some back for her?\r\nKagari: Right now...?\r\nMinato: If we go straight away and it clears up Yukari's fever, then you and her can eat a good dinner together, right?\r\nKagari: I suppose you're right...\r\nMinato: That cake gave you some energy to burn, didn't it? Then quit making excuses and let's go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKagari Joins - Part 2: Hiking\r\n\r\nMinato: Look at that, Kagari! There's some crazy looking mushrooms growing here~. I bet it'd be awful if you ate one!\r\nKagari: Very likely...\r\nMinato: Ah, it looks like all the plants over there are edible though. Why don't we take some back, as a souvenir?\r\nKagari: Excuse me...\r\nMinato: Hm? What's up?\r\nKagari: It feels like we have been walking for a long while. Are we really going the right way?\r\nMinato: Hmm, we should have been there by around now. That's weird...\r\nMinato: Ahhh-! There's false strawberries blooming here~! Take a look, Kagari. You can eat false strawberries. Wanna try one?\r\nKagari: No thank you... Could you please stop finding distractions and lead us where we're going?\r\nMinato: Hey now, don't be like that. We're already out here, so why not enjoy our hiking trip?\r\n\r\nKagari: It's gotten much darker. Is this really the right way?\r\nMinato: We're fine, we're fine. We're just in the shade of the mountain now.\r\nMinato: Yukari and me made a sort of garden around here, so there's no way I'm lost. Oh, hey, look up in that tree!\r\nMinato: Up in that bird's nest, it sounds like there's chicks in there! How cute~.\r\nKagari: (Sigh. I should have gotten a map ready instead of relying on Minato-senpai.)\r\n\r\nMinato: Ooh, back in the sun again. And with that, we're here~!\r\nKagari: There really was a shrine with springwater this deep in the mountains...\r\nMinato: Ahh~, all that walking made me so thirsty. We should grab a drink too.\r\nMinato: Gulp, gulp, gulp... Phwaa-, so good! Come on, Kagari, have some.\r\nKagari: Gulp... Oh, it is good...\r\nMinato: Right? If we bring this to Yukari, she'll be back on her feet in no time. Here, take this canteen and fill it up for her.\r\nKagari: Thank you very much.\r\nMinato: Alright, let's get back to Yukari now.\r\n\r\nKagari: Um, Minato-senpai... It took us over two hours to travel up and down that mountain path, didn't it?\r\nMinato: Ah, er, did it really...?\r\nKagari: So then why did it only take us a short ten minutes to get back from the shrine? Don't tell me you took a detour so you could screw around on the mountain...\r\nMinato: Hey hey, don't worry about the details. What's important is we get this water back to Yukari right away!\r\nKagari: I can't believe her... Wait for me, Minato-senpai.\r\n\r\nYukari: You two got springwater from the mountain out back? Thank you for going out of your way for me. Gulp, gulp...\r\nKagari: The mountain out back? That's what Yukari-sama said, wasn't it, Minato-senpai? But you said we had to cross way on the other side of the mountain... Why did you lie about that!?\r\nMinato: Sorry, sorry. It's just, even though you weren't assigned to do anything, you wouldn't leave or eat anything, so I was worried...\r\nKagari: That doesn't make it okay for you to lie to me like that!\r\nKagari: Ah...\r\nMinato: See, after all that walking, your stomach's growling. Better eat up now!\r\nKagari: Honestly, it's always the same with you... Yukari-sama, please excuse me.\r\nYukari: Minato, thanks for looking after Kagari. Now I can focus on resting without having to worry about her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Xmas' 20 - Kagari: Start]: Let's Not\r\n\r\nMinato: Let's throw a Christmas party!\r\nKagari: Let's not.\r\nMinato: Ehh, come on, Kagari-.\r\nMinato: It's Christmas and everything, so aren't we missing out not having fun with it?\r\nKagari: ...Sigh.\r\nKagari: Unlike you, Minato-senpai, Yukari-sama is still busy on Christmas.\r\nKagari: She doesn't have the time to be having a party.\r\nMinato: C'mon, don't be like that-.\r\nMinato: Yukari's gonna suffocate if she doesn't have some fun. Right, Yukari?\r\nYukari: Don't you think it's unfair pushing this on me?\r\nMinato: Is it?\r\nYukari: Honestly...\r\nYukari: Kagari, if we work with my schedule, couldn't we fit an hour in?\r\nKagari: Yukari-sama!?\r\nMinato: Awesome!\r\nMinato: Alright, I'll go invite everybody then! Thanks, Yukari!\r\nKagari: These are the only times she works quickly... Will this really be alright?\r\nYukari: Sure. So, you need to enjoy the Christmas party too, Kagari.\r\nKagari: No, I'll just...\r\nYukari: If you say that you aren't going, Minato would come by almost every day.\r\nKagari: Urgh...\r\nYukari: Just give up on it.\r\nKagari: ...Sigh.\r\n\r\nMinato: That makes Yukari, Kagari, Yuzuki-senpai, Iroha-senpai, Ema, Yukina, Sana, and Akane-chan... This'll be a fun Christmas party!\r\nMinato: It's cold though!\r\nMinato: It's been getting colder lately... Wonder if it'll snow on Christmas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Xmas' 20 - Kagari: End]: A White Christmas\r\n\r\nOn Christmas.\r\n\r\nMinato: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nAradama: ooo...\r\nMinato: Come on, why's it we always get missions on days like today!\r\nKagari: Please work your hands more than your mouth, Minato-senpai.\r\nKagari: HAAH!\r\nAradama: ...\r\nMinato: I'm doing that just fine.\r\nMinato: And besides, you looked like you were getting into setting things up for the party. Aren't you bummed out?\r\nKagari: Since I said I would do it, I wanted to do it properly.\r\nKagari: That aside, Minato-senpai. If you want to go to the Christmas party so badly, please take this mission seriously.\r\nKagari: The time you're wasting here is going to take away from that.\r\nMinato: You've got a point! Let's hurry it up, Kagari!\r\nKagari: Does anything ever get you down... Ah.\r\nKagari: Snow?\r\nKagari: No wonder it feels so cold...\r\nMinato: What's wrong... Hey, it's snowing!\r\nMinato: It's a white Christmas, Kagari!\r\nKagari: ...It is.\r\nMinato: Now I'm feeling it! Let's go, Kagari!\r\nKagari: Alright!\r\n\r\nKagari: We never managed to hold the Christmas party in the end. It only snowed for that brief moment too...\r\nMinato: Hey, there's nothing we could do about it.\r\nKagari: ...You don't seem that disappointed?\r\nMinato: Yeah, I guess not?\r\nMinato: Somehow, just getting to see the snow with you's got me satisfied!\r\nKagari: ...\r\nKagari: What's that supposed to mean?\r\nMinato: Well, it's all good. Anyway, let's make sure to throw a Christmas party next year, Kagari.\r\nKagari: I'd rather not be keeping you company again next year, Minato-senpai."}, {"paste_key": "KrgyLkRT", "title": "Fujiwara Minato Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/KrgyLkRT", "timestamp": "", "hits": "113", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/QTL1maXuvOs\r\nhttps://youtu.be/nqyOMfDau7o\r\n\r\n1: School Life 20 Years Ago\r\n\r\nMinato: There's no sign of these aradama, huh.\r\nYukari: That's true. But there's no mistaking they're in the area...\r\nKagari: .........\r\nMinato: Wanna take a break? At this rate, we'll be worn out by the time we do find them.\r\nYukari: Don't. This amount of exercise shouldn't be enough to tire any of us, should it?\r\nKagari: ...\r\nMinato: But the weather's so nice... Yawwwwn, 'scuse me.\r\nKagari: Get your act together, Minato-senpai! Why are you so unmotivated?\r\nMinato: Ehh, but I've got lots of motivation...\r\nKagari: Start taking this seriously.\r\nMinato: I am though. Ah, the spectrum meter found something!\r\nMinato: C'mon, Yukari, Kagari!\r\nKagari: Ah, stay with us, Minato-senpai!\r\nYukari: Sigh, Minato... Let's go, Kagari.\r\nKagari: ...Right.\r\n\r\nThe next day.\r\n\r\nYukari: Finally, there you are. So you were sleeping out here.\r\nMinato: Nnn... Morning, Yukari. The sun feels so good. Wanna join me?\r\nYukari: Sigh, I already expect this from you, but... Kagari is still upset, you know?\r\nMinato: Ehhh, but I beat the aradama and everything...\r\nYukari: While you ran off on your own. What did Kagari tell you yesterday?\r\nMinato: Uh... That I had no motivation. Is that really how it seems?\r\nYukari: I wouldn't say you aren't serious, but you do appear too apathetic.\r\nYukari: Suppressing aradama is an important duty. Just knowing what you're capable of... I can understand how Kagari feels.\r\nMinato: You're kind of putting me on the spot here.\r\nMinato: I said it yesterday, but it's not like I'm not motivated. I'm taking this seriously.\r\nMinato: I guess it's just hard to tell from how I act?\r\nYukari: Then make an effort to show it, if even just slightly more.\r\nMinato: I'll give it my best shot.\r\nMinato: Anyway, that's gonna be starting soon, isn't it, Yukari!\r\nYukari: That... The inter-league tournament?\r\nMinato: Yeah! I wonder who's gonna be participating this year? We'll get to fight girls we wouldn't normally get matches with!\r\nMinato: I already can't wait!\r\nYukari: ...Try putting that enthusiasm into your duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: What I Like\r\n\r\nMinato: Excuse meee, anyone around...? Alright! Let's get cooking!\r\nMinato: Hmhmhmm~.\r\nMinato: Mmm~, the cup yakisoba's good to go! Just have to wait 3 minutes now!\r\nMinato: Nobody can fight on an empty stomach.\r\nMinato: It's tough training with Yukari, so I've gotta eat up first!\r\nMinato: ...Still not ready?\r\nMinato: One minute......... Two minutes...\r\nMinato: It's a little early, but whatever!\r\nMinato: Pour out the water, mix in the sauce... Mmm~! That smell!\r\nMinato: Time to dig i--\r\nYukari: Minato... Are you in here?\r\nMinato: Geh, Yukari!\r\nYukari: How nice of you to greet your friend with \"Geh\".\r\nYukari: Knowing you, I assumed you had forgotten our promise to train together... But that reaction says otherwise.\r\nMinato: D-Did I remember, or maybe I forgot, who can say...\r\nYukari: It doesn't matter now. Let's go; I have some strict training for you.\r\nMinato: Hang on! It's my fault I was late to training! But, before we go... Give me enough time to eat this!\r\nYukari: I knew I smelled something... Is that cup yakisoba?\r\nMinato: Freshly made, nice and steamy, cup yakisoba! So please... Let it slide just this once, Yukari.\r\nYukari: I do know how you feel. Cup yakisoba is the best when it's freshly made.\r\nYukari: It loses its taste after it cools down.\r\nMinato: Then...!\r\nYukari: However, that doesn't change your promise. Our training should be most important to you right now, shouldn't it?\r\nMinato: Ugh, I can't deny that...\r\nMinato: (What should I do; at this rate the yakisoba will cool off and quickly lose its flavor...!!)\r\nMinato: (And I don't want to eat any gross yakisoba! If it comes down to it...!)\r\nMinato: Yukari... Sorry about this!\r\nYukari: Mrgh! ...(chew chew)\r\nMinato: Alright, now's my chance...! (slurrrrrrrrrp)\r\nYukari: (gulp) ...What are you doing, Minato?\r\nMinato: Ahaha... I thought you'd forgive me if I gave you a bite?\r\nYukari: You can't call shoving it into my mouth giving me a bite.\r\nMinato: But it was good, right?\r\nMinato: Have you ever had cup yakisoba since that time in middle school... When you ran away from home?\r\nYukari: Actually... I've been eating it often.\r\nMinato: Seriously!?\r\nYukari: Secretly, when I could hide it.\r\nYukari: It's difficult to tell anyone I'm eating cup yakisoba.\r\nMinato: No way... Then, next time we train together, we should get cup yakisoba too!\r\nMinato: We'll stick with that!\r\nYukari: ...Good. I'll look forward to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Inside Story of the Enforced Regulation\r\n\r\nMinato: Is this Shikishima Bank? Somebody's supposed to be holed up in there.\r\nPoliceman: Yes, but... Ah, did you hear about it on the news? You shouldn't be here, it's dangerous. Run on home.\r\nMinato: Uhh, I caught some of the news, but I'm the toji who came on behalf of the Special Sword Administration Bureau.\r\nPoliceman: Huh? A toji? J-Just wait right here!\r\n\r\nPolice Inspector: You say you're the toji the Special Sword Administration Bureau dispatched...?\r\nMinato: That's me.\r\nPolice Inspector: You seem a little young...\r\nMinato: Well, I am a toji, so that's pretty normal. I'm Fujiwara Minato, a 2nd year at Renpu Middle School.\r\nMinato: I've been sent here on behalf of the Special Sword Administration Bureau to resolve the Shikishima Bank Siege Incident.\r\nPolice Inspector: They sent a middle schooler here to fight!? Has the Special Sword Administration Bureau lost their minds!?\r\nPolice Inspector: They could have at least gotten a high school student...!\r\nMinato: A high schooler's just 2 years older; it's not that big a difference. And besides, the police are the ones who asked for a toji, right? That's what I heard.\r\nPolice Inspector: The man in there is armed. We can't let a kid like you go anywhere near!\r\nPolice Inspector: In the 30 hours since the case started, there's been one casualty after another. We can't afford to stand by and let another happen.\r\nPolice Inspector: We'll request a change of personnel right away. Sorry it turned out like this just after you got here, but please go home.\r\nMinato: Ah, you don't have to do anything like that.\r\nPolice Inspector: What?\r\nMinato: I'll be finished here in a minute.\r\n\r\nMinato: Mannn, it was pretty crazy back then... They kept saying \"Go home, middle schooler!\"\r\nKagari: ...Sigh, of course they did. Do you understand what happened after that, Minato-senpai?\r\nMinato: What happened? Well I got a little famous, right? It's not that big a deal, Kagari.\r\nKagari: Not a big deal... We're talking about the Shikishima Bank Siege Incident, you know!?\r\nKagari: Do you have any idea what a thrashing the media gave the police for sending a middle school girl in there!?\r\nMinato: Ohh, that.\r\nMinato: I'm the one who said I was going in, so they were really barking up the wrong tree there.\r\nKagari: The police were hardly clear of blame either, when it seems they were hoping the criminal would let his guard down if a child came after him.\r\nMinato: But the police officer there was really worried about me, you know?\r\nKagari: Likely because the officers at the scene hadn't been told what their superiors were planning.\r\nKagari: ...Did you know that, as a result of that incident, a regulation was put in place saying the Special Sword Administration Bureau could no longer intervene in any non-aradama related cases?\r\nMinato: Really?\r\nKagari: ......Sighhhhh.\r\nMinato: Please at least try to consider the repercussions of your actions, Minato-senpai...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Amusement Park\r\n\r\nMinato: We're at the amusement park! Yukari! Yukari! What do you want to ride first?\r\nYukari: You're getting too worked up, Minato.\r\nMinato: But we finally got to come to the amusement park! What's the point if we're not getting worked up?\r\nYukari: ...Is that how this works?\r\nMinato: That's exactly how it works!\r\nMinato: So, so? What do you wanna ride, Yukari? I think we should try the rollercoaster!\r\nYukari: I'll leave it up to you. We can ride that first.\r\nMinato: Alright-!\r\n\r\nMinato: That was great-! Wasn't it, Yukari!\r\nYukari: Yes, and because it's designed for the general public, it didn't put much burden on your body.\r\nMinato: Yukari... Is that really all you have to say about the rollercoaster?\r\nYukari: When you ask me like that, I'm not sure what kind of opinion I'm meant to have.\r\nMinato: Hmm... Yukari, do you have fun at amusement parks?\r\nYukari: I'm not sure how to respond to that. I don't often come to places like this.\r\nYukari: So I'm not sure how to have fun here either.\r\nMinato: Huh? But don't you start getting excited just being at an amusement park?\r\nYukari: Do you?\r\nMinato: You do!\r\nMinato: Alright, today is a holiday, and you aren't here to do an inspection. Got it?\r\nMinato: Which means nobody's stopping you from having all the fun you want!\r\nYukari: ...I see. You're right, Minato. Please teach me how to have fun at an amusement park.\r\nMinato: Sure thing! Just leave it all to me!\r\nMinato: I'll give a lecture on how to enjoy every square inch of the amusement park!\r\nMinato: First off, we're getting back on the rollercoaster! While we're riding this time, try letting out a big scream!\r\nYukari: A scream... I'll try it.\r\n\r\nMinato/Yukari: KYAAAAAA------!!\r\nYukari: Amazing. All I did was scream, but it was so much more exciting this time...! I suppose it's something you can't understand until you try it yourself.\r\nYukari: What will we ride next, Minato?\r\nMinato: Okay, next up is a classic, the teacup ride! Come on, Yukari! I'll show you all kinds of exciting things to do!\r\nYukari: Good!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Getting Along\r\n\r\nMinato: Kagari, come sleep with me!\r\nStudents: They're sleeping together!?\r\nKagari: ...Minato-senpai, please refrain from saying things that others will misunderstand.\r\nMinato: Misunderstand what? We're friends, aren't we? Remember, we went to that hot spring together.\r\nStudents: Hot spring!!\r\nKagari: Along with Ema-senpai.\r\nMinato: Whatever, just come take an afternoon nap with me! I found the perfect spot.\r\nKagari: I'm not going to.\r\n\r\nKagari: ...\r\nMinato: ...\r\nKagari: Minato-senpai, just how long do you plan on following me?\r\nMinato: Hey, I have something to take care of over this way too, okay?\r\nKagari: ...\r\nKagari: You also have some business in the training hall, Minato-senpai?\r\nMinato: Wait? You're going to the training hall, Kagari? Me too! I just felt like getting a little exercise, you know.\r\nMinato: Then this is where we part ways.\r\nMinato: Wait!? You just said, \"you also have business\", didn't you!?\r\nKagari: You must have misheard me.\u3000\r\nKagari: I have work to do now, as Yukari-sama's attendant. I'll speak with you later.\r\nMinato: Hey!\r\nMinato: ...Nng, she's so stubborn! But that just gets me more fired up!\r\n\r\nMinato: Yukari! I'm here to mess around!\r\nYukari: ...Minato, do you think this is a playground?\r\nKagari: Minato-senpai, now you're even bothering Yukari-sama...! What are you doing here!?\r\nMinato: I told you, messing around. You should join me, Yukari. You're gonna work yourself to death keeping this up.\r\nYukari: I wouldn't say I've been working myself that hard.\r\nKagari: That's enough! What are you thinking, dragging Yukari-sama into this!\r\nMinato: I just wanna get along with you, Kagari.\r\nKagari: ...!?\r\nYukari: ...So she says, Kagari. Why not go along with her?\r\nKagari: But...\r\nMinato: Then, how about this! Kagari and I'll have a match, and the loser has to do whatever the winner says.\r\nKagari: ...That's ridiculous.\r\nMinato: Don't be like that~!\r\nKagari: ...Fine, I know you won't give up anyway. But if I win, I'm going to ask you not to follow me around anymore!\r\nMinato: If you win! Alright, you're on.\r\nYukari: ...Fufu, they get along so well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinato Joins - Part 1: The Sea and Mountains in April\r\n\r\nMinato: Yeaaaay! It's the sea, it's the sea~! Even though it's still spring back in Kamakura, it feels like summer out here. Now if we could just find someone selling shaved ice, this'd be perfect~.\r\nKagari: Minato-senpai, I'm sure you're aware, but we came here to suppress aradama. Not to sightsee.\r\nYukari: Kagari is right. We need to eliminate the aradama first.\r\nMinato: I knowww...\r\nYukari: Don't sound so depressed; it'll affect our mission. Here, cheer up. If we finish quickly enough, we should have spare time for recreation.\r\nMinato: Oh yeah! In that case, we just gotta take 'em out quick. Alright, aradama, bring it on, wherever you are!\r\nKagari: The spectrum meter is reacting... They seem to be up in the mountains.\r\nYukari: We'll head there at once!\r\n\r\nKagari: That's strange... The spectrum meter lost track.\r\nYukari: Did they temporarily retreat somewhere? Until it picks up the signal again, we should find a safe spot to rest.\r\nMinato: Hmm~, finding a safe spot's a good idea, but... Where are we, anyway? It looks like a dead end up ahead.\r\nYukari: We must be deep in the forest now. We should turn back the way we came.\r\n\r\nMinato: Huh? That's weird. I swear we just passed by here...\r\nKagari: It feels like we've been walking a great distance, but what if we've been walking in circles the whole time?\r\nMinato: Ehh!? Does that mean we're lost? When you're lost in the mountains, you're supposed to...\r\nMinato: If we walk along a stream, it should lead us to a more open area, right?\r\nKagari: I see, a stream... I heard the faint sound of running water just a moment ago; there should be one nearby.\r\nYukari: Wait. It sounds like a good idea in theory, but what if following the stream led us to a waterfall or rock face? We wouldn't be able to progress.\r\nYukari: If we carelessly follow the stream down, there's a possibility we could only waste our energy and put ourselves in a more precarious position.\r\nMinato: When you put it like that, you might be right.\r\nKagari: How are we meant to find our way down then...?\r\nYukari: If you have the stamina for it, ascending to the mountain's summit will increase your odds of finding a path back down.\r\nMinato: Huh. You know, even though we're the same age, it feels like there's nothing you don't know, Yukari. I have a lotta respect for that.\r\nKagari: The polar opposite of Minato-senpai, who was about to irresponsibly send us down a stream...\r\nMinato: What'd you say!?\r\nAradama: KIIIIIEE!\r\nYukari: So they showed themselves...\r\nKagari: And there's a lot of them too. How to efficiently deal with them all...\r\nMinato: I've got a good idea for that! Come on, follow me!\r\nKagari: Minato-senpai? To where?\r\nYukari: ...I get it. Kagari, follow after Minato.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinato Joins - Part 2: Playing in the Water\r\n\r\nKagari: Minato-senpai, the aradama are chasing us; are we not going to fight them?\r\nMinato: Don't worry about them for now; just follow me!\r\n\r\nYukari: We reached the stream. Kagari, we're going to run along it for a little longer.\r\nKagari: Eh? But what about the aradama?\r\nMinato: Keep following and wait and see~! Let's go!\r\n\r\nAradama: KIEEEEE!\r\nAradama: GUOOOO!\r\nMinato: Nice, the aradama all came after us. Okay, Yukari, Kagari, it's time to get to work!\r\nYukari: Understood! We're beginning our attack. TAAAAAAAH-!\r\nMinato: DORYAAAAAAAA-!\r\nKagari: (So the plan was to lure the aradama along the stream and wipe them out all at once... I should join in..)\r\nKagari: HAAAAAAAAAH-!\r\nAradama: Kiiiie...\r\nMinato: Awesome, that's all of them wiped out! My plan went perfectly~!\r\nYukari: That was some quick thinking, confining the aradama here with the stream. Well done, Minato.\r\nMinato: It was your advice before that made me come up with it. If we were really in an pinch, I thought we could drop down the waterfall.\r\nKagari: (The judgment to immediately apply information you had just heard as tactics in battle... It pains me to admit it, but Minato-senpai is good...)\r\nMinato: Now we can get back to the path... Oh yeah! We were lost, weren't we?\r\nMinato: Grr, and I thought we could play in the ocean after finishing the aradama this fast-!\r\nYukari: Calm down, Minato. I told you before. At times like these, we only need to ascend the mountain.\r\nMinato: Ehh, but we've been running around so much, and you want us to keep climbing? I'm too tired to move an inch-! I just wanna head down the mountain and fool around already-!\r\nKagari: If you have the energy to spare fooling around, you can make your way up this mountain. Go on, follow Yukari-sama.\r\nMinato: Fineee...\r\n\r\nMinato: Ahh~, finally, back at the beach-! I wasn't sure if we'd really find a way down after climbing to the top of the mountain, but Yukari was right like always~.\r\nKagari: And we even found the shortest path right to the beach... Minato-senpai's desire to fool around must have been strong enough for the heavens to answer.\r\nYukari: At any rate, we made it safely down the mountain, so feel free to use our remaining time here as you wish.\r\nMinato: Yesss-! Last one in the water's a rotten egg!\r\nKagari: In the water? It's still only April. And none of us brought bathing suits...\r\nMinato: Just go in like this? We're all covered in mud from fighting the aradama, so we can clean off while we're at it!\r\nMinato: See, come on in, Kagari. Take this!\r\nKagari: That's cold-! Now you've done it, Minato-senpai. I'll show you...\r\nYukari: It's cold...\r\nKagari: Yu... Yukari-sama! I'm terribly sorry! I only meant to splash Minato-senpai, but...\r\nYukari: Now that I'm this wet, you leave me no choice. I'll accept this challenge.\r\nMinato: That's the spirit, Yukari! This is how things ought to be! Kagari, Yukari, let's get this started-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/nqyOMfDau7o\r\n[Mahouka - Minato: Start]: Three Lost People\r\n\r\nHonoka: Heeeey! Kanami-? Mihono-?\r\nHonoka: ............\r\nHonoka: Nnnn, they're not answering, Shizuku.\r\nShizuku: Yep. There's no mistaking it.\r\nShizuku: We're lost.\r\nHonoka: Of course we are... Sigh. And just when they were finally able to take us out sightseeing...\r\nShizuku: We probably weren't separated that far from them. We should meet up again soon.\r\nHonoka: Yeah, you're right... Okay! Let's look for them!\r\n???: Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear you. You're lost, right?\r\n???: If it's alright, want me to help you look?\r\nHonoka: Are you sure? Umm, you're...?\r\nShizuku: Who are you?\r\nMinato: Me?\r\nMinato: Actually, I'm lost too. I came here with two friends of mine, but somehow I got stuck on my own.\r\nHonoka: Oh, I see. Since you have an okatana, you must be a toji... Wait? Isn't that okatana...?\r\nMinato: What, Chidori?\r\nShizuku: Someone we know has the same okatana.\r\nMinato: Someone you know...?\r\nMinato: You sure you're not mixing it up? Chidori's my okatana.\r\nHonoka: Really? But, maybe there's another one of that okatana...\r\nMinato: There isn't one.\r\nHonoka: Huh?\r\nShizuku: Honoka. We must just be just mistaken.\r\nHonoka: ...That's probably it, Shizuku.\r\nMinato: ...Hey, what's this girl like? The one you think has Chidori.\r\nHonoka: Umm... She's bright and cheery... Ah, she kind of feels a bit like you.\r\nMinato: Hmm...\r\nMinato: Alright. In that case, like I said before, I'll help you look for them. I want to meet this girl too.\r\nShizuku: You sure?\r\nMinato: Sure thing!\r\nHonoka: But, you're lost too, aren't you?\r\nMinato: I'll be fine. I figure I'll see my friends soon enough, and we might run into them when we're looking for your friends too.\r\nHonoka: I got it. Then, let's search together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mahouka - Minato: End]: Ideal Dream\r\n\r\nMinato: Hmmm, we aren't finding anybody.\r\nHonoka: You're not wrong...\r\nHonoka: We've been looking for a while now, but, where could they have gone...\r\nShizuku: Honoka.\r\nHonoka: What is it, Shizuku?\r\nShizuku: The koi are swimming up. Do you think they want food?\r\nHonoka: What do koi eat, anyway?\r\nMinato: Koi are omnivores, so they'll eat anything.\r\nMinato: ...By the way, I've never seen your uniforms before. Where's it from?\r\nMinato: It's not a school from around here, right?\r\nShizuku: It's the National Magic University Affiliated First High School.\r\nHonoka: Sh-Shizuku!? Was it really alright telling her?\r\nShizuku: We already told Mihono and the others, so why bother now.\r\nHonoka: Ah... You have a point.\r\nMinato: ...Magic?\r\nHonoka: Yes, though you might not believe us...\r\nMinato: ...Well yeah, I'm honestly not sure I believe you.\r\nShizuku: But, it's true. This world is a dream, and Honoka and I come from a different world.\r\nMinato: ...A dream?\r\nShizuku: That's right.\r\nMinato: A dream... Wait, but... Then, is that what's going on?\r\nHonoka: Is what...?\r\nMinato: You said you knew somebody who has Chidori, right?\r\nHonoka: Ah, yes.\r\nMinato: Then, maybe that's the real one.\r\nHonoka: What do you mean by that...?\r\nMinato: I'm saying, I'm pretty sure mine's just a dream.\r\nShizuku: What are you saying, all of a sudden?\r\n???: Minato-senpai! Where are you-?\r\nMinato: Ah, looks like I found a friend of mine. Then, seeya.\r\nMinato: I think you'll definitely run into yours soon too.\r\nHonoka: Um, what was your name...\r\nHonoka: ...She's already gone.\r\nMihono: Honoka-saaan! Shizuku-saaan!\r\nHonoka: Ah.\r\nKanami: Thank goodness, we finally found you! We were looking all over for you two!\r\nHonoka/Shizuku: ......\r\nMihono: What's wrong?\r\nShizuku: Kanami, tell me your okatana's name.\r\nKanami: Uh, it's Chidori...?\r\nHonoka/Shizuku: ......\r\nHonoka: Shizuku, that means...\r\nShizuku: Yep. We might have seen a ghost."}, {"paste_key": "Y0hKJ1WF", "title": "Ban Tsugumi Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/Y0hKJ1WF", "timestamp": "", "hits": "128", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/K--ldddq7Fw\r\nhttps://youtu.be/evNvCiMwU_E\r\nhttps://youtu.be/hYaqFwGk9SI\r\nhttps://youtu.be/imReN1M24ss\r\n\r\n1: Efficiency Above All\r\n\r\nMihono: Tsugumi-san, delivery for youuu!\r\nKanami: Ehehe, I tagged along too.\r\nTsugumi: Asakura-san and Etou-san? I'm sure I asked Shichinosato-san to bring me that package though?\r\nMihono: Fukki said \"I don't think I want anything to do with this\", gave it to us, and ran off.\r\nTsugumi: Ah, she got suspicious.\r\nKanami: Of what, Tsugumi-san?\r\nTsugumi: Oh, nothing, only talking to myself. Thank you for bringing that here in Shichinosato-san's place. Could you place it over here?\r\nMihono: Sure, heave ho.\r\nMihono: What's all this for, by the way? All these ingredients, herbs, spices, these weird supplements; there sure is a whole lot of stuff...\r\nTsugumi: Oh, these? With these, first you place the ingredients and what have you in the blender...\r\nTsugumi: Sprinkle all the supplements in here as well...\r\nTsugumi: And there you have it. All that's left is to fill it into vacuum packs, write the dates, and it's done.\r\nMihono: U-Uhh...?\u3000\r\nKanami: Is it some kind of drug for your aradama research...?\r\nTsugumi: No, these are my meals for the week.\r\nKanami/Mihono: EHHHH-!?\r\nTsugumi: When there's time, I do eat solid foods, but during busy hours in the lab, this can provide me with all the nutrition of a full meal.\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan, does that look tasty to you...?\r\nMihono: I-I don't know...\r\nTsugumi: If you're interested, why not try it? I ordered a surplus of ingredients this time, thinking I would offer some to Shichinosato-san.\r\nMihono: Should we eat it, Kanami?\r\nKanami: U-Ummm...\r\nTsugumi: There's no reason to be concerned; every ingredient in there is perfectly healthy. And I've proven its effectiveness with my own body.\r\nKanami: Then... It's a little off-putting, but we might as well...\r\nMihono: If you're in, then I am too...\r\nTsugumi: Here you are then. Please gulp it all down.\r\n\r\nMihono: ...Ah!\r\nMihono: H-Huh...? What were we doing here again...?\r\nKanami: You know, I don't know... What did we come here for?\r\nMihono: Mmmm, I can't remember...\r\nMihono: But I'm feeling all fired up! Like I'm bursting with energy!\r\nKanami: Yeah, I feel it too, Mihono-chan! Hey hey, want to go to the dojo and train together?\r\nMihono: Great idea! I feel like I can't sit still for some reason! Let's go right now!\r\nTsugumi: When the two of them collapsed, I wasn't sure what would happen, but I'm glad to see that both are fine.\r\nTsugumi: Though, I don't think it's so bad that they should lose their short-term memory...\r\nTsugumi: Mm, as I thought, it tastes the same as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Poker Faces of Renpu\r\n\r\nTsugumi: ......\r\nYomi: ......\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nTsugumi: She's very late, isn't she? President Takatsu. Preparations for the mock battle were finished quite some time ago.\r\nYomi: Yes, she's later than the scheduled time. Itomi-san, we should warm up once more.\r\nSayaka: Understood.\r\nTsugumi: Oh, is that your phone, Satsuki-san?\r\nYomi: It's President Takatsu calling.\r\nYomi: Yes............. Yes.\r\nYomi: Today's mock battle has been cancelled. Itomi-san and I are dismissed, Ban-san is to continue with her lab work.\r\nTsugumi: Cancelled? Something urgent must have gotten her attention.\r\nYomi: That's how it seems. Now, I will return to Yukari-sama.\r\nTsugumi: Hm... She made us wait so long, yet you don't seem bothered by it. You have quite the poker face, Satsuki-san.\r\nTsugumi: In fact, I get that a lot myself. People tell me they can't read my expressions.\r\nSayaka: Tsugumi.\r\nTsugumi: Yes? What is it, Itomi-san?\r\nSayaka: Kaoru said I had a poker face before too.\r\nTsugumi: I see. That means, all of us gathered here have been told we have poker faces at one point.\r\nTsugumi: That being the case. Why don't we try something to outgrow our poker faces?\r\nYomi: To outgrow it...?\r\nSayaka: Try what?\r\nTsugumi: Try practicing smiling, of course. A strong smile is a fundamental of social interaction.\r\nSayaka: If I smile, will Kaoru not call me poker face?\r\nTsugumi: I believe so. Well, that's my proposal, but I'd like if you joined us, Satsuki-san.\r\nYomi: ...Very well.\r\nTsugumi: Then, we'll all practice together. On the count of 3... 3, 2, 1.\r\nKofuki: Oiii, let me play with the aradama-chan again... The hell are you guys doing?\r\nSayaka: This is smile practice...\r\nYomi: Mm......\r\nTsugumi: How is it? Are we smiling well?\r\nTsugumi: Please share your thoughts, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: Uh, I don't really know what to say... When you're making that face, it just looks like you're up to no good. And Sayaka and Yomi-senpai are lost causes.\r\nSayaka: I failed.\r\nYomi: It's not something that can be improved in a day, is it. I'll be returning to my duties then.\r\nTsugumi: Of course. Let's practice together again sometime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Scouting\r\n\r\nHamatsuka Sakura: H-Hello... Ban-senpai, it's Hamatsuka...\r\nTsugumi: Ah, I've been expecting you, Hamatsuka-san. I'd like to ask for your help treating an injury, if that's alright?\r\nSakura: Of course, I'll gladly help, but... I thought Shichinosato-san got hurt again, but, you're the one injured today, Ban-senpai...?\r\nTsugumi: There's a presentation on aradama research coming up, have you heard?\r\nSakura: Yes, I heard someone mention it... I'm going to disinfect the wound, alright? This may sting a little...\r\nTsugumi: Urgh... The antiseptic is working its way into the cut...\r\nTsugumi: ...Shichonosato-san has been busy with the investigation team lately. So I thought I'd work to collect data as well, but you can see how it turned out.\r\nSakura: ...Please be careful of your own limits. It's only a light cut this time, but you could have been seriously injured...\r\nTsugumi: Thank you for worrying about me, Hamatsuka-san.\r\nTsugumi: Considering how this turned out, it seems I do in fact need a helper. Well, I can stop here and try scouting a promising toji.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: With that in mind, I've joined an aradama suppression mission to scout the so-called ace of the next generation, Nagasaki Sumi...\r\nFujimaki Minaki: Nn? What's up, Tsugumi-senpai?\r\nNagasaki Sumi: Am I maybe too tall for you to see past me...? Uuu, I'm sorry then...!\r\nTsugumi: Oh no, I didn't say anything like that. I was only speaking to myself, so please, pay me no mind. More importantly, please keep watching ahead.\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAA!\r\nMinaki: Oh, we found the aradama! Tsugumi-senpai, you stay with Sumicchi!\r\nTsugumi: So she says. I will provide support. Please do whatever you feel is best, Nagasaki-san.\r\nSumi: Right!\r\nTsugumi: (Now then, let's see what Nagasaki-san is capable of.)\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Nagasaki-san, an aradama is approaching from the right. I will do a feint, so will you please finish it off.\r\nSumi: Okay! I understand! DEEEIIH~!\r\nTsugumi: (I had heard she was an apprehensive person, but in combat, she doesn't seem intimidated.)\r\nMinaki: Nice going, Sumicchi! Alright, I can't let you do all the work!\r\nTsugumi: (Hm, I cannot ignore Fujimaki-san's communication skills either. By having her around, things are progressing smoothly. Perhaps I can try aiming for a two man set of helpers here.)\r\nTsugumi: With that decided, all that's needed is for us to clear out the remaining aradama.\r\n\r\nSumi: Thank you very much, Ban-senpai! It was so easy maneuvering with your help!\r\nTsugumi: My primary role is acting as an operator, after all. Besides, you're also as impressive as the rumors suggested, Nagasaki-san.\r\nSumi: Rumors...? Huh-!? Don't tell me, rumors about my height have spread as far as you, senpai!?\r\nMinaki: Ahahaha! You sure are cute, Sumicchi! Even though you're so tall!\r\nSumi: Uuu, I got called tall again...\r\nTsugumi: You may be lacking in confidence though, Nagasaki-san.\r\nSumi: It's not something to be confident about though... It's no good, being this tall...\r\nTsugumi: There are some occupations that seek out taller people. For example, modeling.\r\nSumi: Modeling!?\r\nTsugumi: Yes. Whether or not you plan on becoming a future model, I happen to be looking for a model of my own... Would you be interested?\r\nSumi: Me, a model, me... I-I'll try my best!\r\nMinaki: Sumicchi's going to be a model? That sounds like a fun time! Tsugumi-senpai! I wanna give it a shot too!\r\nTsugumi: Of course, by all means.\r\nTsugumi: (What I need is a model case in aradama suppression data, but I would be lying if I said that wasn't a form of modeling in its own right.)\r\nTsugumi: Phew, with this, I should be able to make it before the presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Beyond Aradama Research\r\n\r\nMirja: ...I believe the laboratory is this way. I'll pay a visit then.\r\nTsugumi: Well, if it isn't Kitora-san. What brings you here? Are you looking for Shichinosato-san?\r\nMirja: No, I'm here to speak to you. There's something I would like to ask you.\r\nMirja: (Ban Tsugumi, second year in high school at Renpu Girls' School... A person with an accomplished past as a toji, a member of the aradama research team, and acting operator for mock battles...)\r\nMirja: (It's said she has great skills of observation, so let's see...)\r\nMirja: Would that be fine with you? It shouldn't take much of your time.\r\nTsugumi: Of course, go right ahead.\r\nTsugumi: If it's about how to handle Shichinosato-san, I can answer any of your questions.\r\nMirja: ...I'm surprised you could tell.\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san isn't the type to listen to orders, so I assume she's been giving you a hard time.\r\nMirja: I'll get right to the point then. Could you hear me out?\r\nTsugumi: Certainly, I'll help as much as I can.\r\nMirja: I've heard you have been together with Shichinosato Kofuki for a long time. And that you are skilled at managing her.\r\nMirja: As far as I am aware, the only other person capable of doing that is Setouchi Chie. However, I cannot copy her results.\r\nMirja: That being the case, is there any technique you can teach me that would prevent Shichinosato Kofuki from causing problems?\r\nTsugumi: A technique to stop her causing problems?\r\nTsugumi: I don't really do anything like that. She and I just share a common interest... To sound like Shichinosato-san, \"I hella love aradama-chan too!\"\r\nMirja: I-Is that so...\r\nTsugumi: Just so there isn't any confusion, my interest isn't in combat with aradama like Shichinosato-san's, but with the very existence of aradama themselves.\r\nTsugumi: To me, combat with aradama is only if it's absolutely necessary.\r\nMirja: I see... Though it feels somewhat wasteful. I had heard you had an impressive record as a toji. Do you not have any plans of returning to that role?\r\nTsugumi: I wouldn't mind going back to it now and then, but this has my priority now. I've set my sights on a big dream.\r\nMirja: A big dream? What would that be?\r\nTsugumi: Fufu, would you believe me if I said a Nobel Peace Prize?\r\nMirja: With your research on aradama...?\r\nTsugumi: ...Yes. I'd like to be awarded one through researching aradama.\r\nMirja: I didn't know... In that case, it's not surprising you get along well with Shichinosato Kofuki.\r\nTsugumi: I'm quite the odd specimen myself.\r\nMirja: Still, it's a fascinating subject. I never would have imagined a Nobel Peace Prize going to someone in aradama research.\r\nTsugumi: It's hard for me to picture too. But, don't you think the fun in life comes from challenging the impossible?\r\nTsugumi: That's why, understanding how impossible she can be, please do your best in getting along with Shichinosato-san.\r\nMirja: In getting along with Shichinosato Kofuki... Fufu, I suppose you're right. I'll try remaining patient and straightforward with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Meeting Kofuki\r\n\r\nThat was two years ago-- I was still a toji in the thick of the action then.\r\nThe problem child, Shichinosato Kofuki, was infamous among the toji of Renpu Girls' School.\r\nThey call her the walking order violation. The aradama-chan junkie. The two-fanged mad dog.\r\nThat girl had been passed off from unit to unit, until finally being assigned to mine, where none of the toji would approach her.\r\nUntil I offered to be her partner that day.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: It's our first time teaming up like this, isn't it.\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nTsugumi: By the way, do you like fighting aradama, Shichinosato-san?\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nTsugumi: Hello? Did you not hear me? Hello in there~? Do you like fighting aradama, Shichinosato-san?\r\nKofuki: ...! Fuck off, so what if I do? You gonna give me the cold shoulder like the rest of them?\r\nTsugumi: No no, you don't have to worry about that. If anything, you could say I'm burning with curiosity.\r\nKofuki: I don't care either way! Tch, why'd I have to be stuck with you...!\r\nKofuki: Let's get this straight; just cause you're my senpai doesn't mean I'm gonna do what you tell me. If any aradama-chan show up, I'm doing things my way.\r\nTsugumi: Of course, I don't have a problem with that.\r\nKofuki: Huh? You sure?\r\nTsugumi: Yes. If that's what produces results, then go right ahead.\r\nTsugumi: Ah, aradama sighted! You're up, Shichinosato-san, go, go, go!\r\nKofuki: Haha! Finally, a senpai that has the right idea!\r\n\r\nKofuki: Pant, pant, pant... Heh, hehe, ten, nah, twenty of 'em I think...?\r\nTsugumi: Nineteen, to be exact. Either way, very nicely done.\r\nKofuki: Pant, pant... You didn't even try to jump in, did you?\r\nTsugumi: Of course not. That was our agreement. I did take care of the three that came my way though.\r\nKofuki: You've got some screws loose, you know...\r\nKofuki: But, so long as I get to do whatever I want like this, how about we be partners on the next mission too?\r\nTsugumi: I'm sorry to say that this was my last mission. I'm retiring from the front lines and being assigned to a research team.\r\nKofuki: Wha...\r\nKofuki: The hell... You got my hopes up a little...\r\nTsugumi: Would you like to come with me? Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: What?\r\nTsugumi: I'll be acting as operator for the aradama research team, but they still haven't found anyone to cover the practical side of the combat testing.\r\nTsugumi: Hardly surprising with such a difficult role, having to kill countless aradama day after day... Is there really anyone out there who would take such an awful position...?\r\nKofuki: You were after this all along, weren't you... You should've said something sooner!\r\n\r\nAnd that's how I met Shichinosato-san.\r\nOur current relationship? If I had to say, I don't think it's going too badly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTsugumi Joins - Part 1: Must-Have Data\r\n\r\nSayaka: Kofuki... Good work.\r\nKofuki: Mann, that's another day I got to mess around with so many aradama-chan.\r\nSayaka: You weren't messing around... It was a mission.\r\nKofuki: Whatever, it's the same thing.\r\nTsugumi: Oh, hello, Itomi-san, Shichinosato-san. Back from suppressing aradama?\r\nKofuki: Yep. Got a whole lot of combat data out of it too. Can't even remember how many I beat.\r\nTsugumi: I'm glad to hear it, but why did you suppress so many?\r\nKofuki: The other toji got colds or the flu or something and couldn't show up.\r\nSayaka: Kofuki and I have been called to take their place.\r\nTsugumi: Ahh, that's why. I've never had the flu myself, but it sounds serious.\r\nKofuki: You know, even though you don't look healthy, I've never seen you getting sick before.\r\nTsugumi: I maintain proper nutrition and sleeping hours; a necessity if your want to get good research done.\r\nSayaka: I eat a lot of Mai's cookies and sleep a lot too.\r\nKofuki: Sayaka... What are you ganging up on me for?\r\nTsugumi: Anyway, I now understand the reason you haven't been joining in mock battles lately, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: That's cause fresh aradama-chan are the best! I'll take them any day over the ones we get in testing!\r\nSayaka: They're calling me for dinner. Kofuki, Tsugumi... Bye.\r\nKofuki: Better not catch a cold. Actually, don't worry about it, cause if you do, I get all your aradama-chans.\r\nTsugumi: Now then, why don't we get something to eat too?\r\nKofuki: When you say \"something\", you mean one of those packs full of whatever you tossed in the blender, right... I don't want any.\r\nTsugumi: I think they're quite effective at warding off colds, but I won't force you.\r\nTsugumi: There is something I would like to confirm with you though, and it's cold out here, so would you mind coming to the lab before you go eat?\r\nKofuki: If you say so.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: I'm starting to gather data on which parts of an aradama can efficiently disable it if they are cut--\r\nKofuki: Now, I asked to aim for the part that seems to be the head... But do you think that's too difficult?\r\nTsugumi: Ask all you want, but when things are getting serious, it's gonna be impossible to aim just for the head.\r\nTsugumi: That's a reasonable opinion. I'd asked others as well, but wasn't having good results.\r\nKofuki: Well, it's true that some of them just drop dead as soon as you crack open their head though.\r\nTsugumi: I'm sorry; I know it's unreasonable.\r\nTsugumi: Just because I want this data doesn't mean I can expose other toji to danger...\r\nKofuki: I mean, if I have the time, I'll try playing along and see what happens. Anyway, I'm gonna get some food.\r\nTsugumi: Of course. I'll see you later.\r\nTsugumi: With this case, it may be better to collect some data myself first.\r\nTsugumi: But, where to begin... Sip... Sip...\r\nTsugumi: These nutrition packs seem just as tasty as ordinary food to me... Sip... Sip...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTsugumi Joins - Part 2: Give and Take\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Oh, it's already 1:00... I should get ready for bed.\r\nTsugumi: Though, aradama clearly don't care if it's the dead of night. What should I do; this is a perfect chance to gather some data.\r\nTsugumi: If Shichinosato-san goes along, the aradama will likely be killed before any data can be gathered on attacks to the head... Hmmm.\r\nTsugumi: Well, I suppose there's no other option.\r\n\r\nKofuki: Damnit... You can't just tell me to get ready in 40 seconds! Gimme more time than that.\r\nTsugumi: Mm... And just when I went out of my way to share information on an aradama appearance with you. Well, if I had left without saying anything, you might have sensed it on your own.\r\nKofuki: What am I, an aradama radar!?\r\nKofuki: But I guess you did get this playground ready for me, so I do owe you one.\r\nTsugumi: Good, I'm counting on you.\r\nAradama: GGGIIIIII...!\r\nKofuki: Even if you're just a little baby aradama-chan, you've got my attention tonight!\r\nAradama: GUOOooo...\r\nTsugumi: One strike to the head, well done. Slow and steady progress is the key to data collection.\r\nKofuki: There's a bigger one round here too, right? Where is it?\r\nTsugumi: Let's get going then. Over that way.\r\nKofuki: \"That way\"...? Why're you pointing off into the sky? Oi, where are we going?\r\n\r\nKofuki: So the main attraction's that bigass bird looking aradama-chan?\r\nTsugumi: Correct. I asked the unit on duty tonight if they could guide it here.\r\nKofuki: Is that right.\r\nKofuki: If that thing came flying up at us, it'd be pretty easy aiming for the head, wouldn't it?\r\nTsugumi: Well, that's one way of looking at it, fufu.\r\nKofuki: Hahah! You want this aradama-chan data that badly, huh! Fine, I'll go and get it for you!\r\nTsugumi: Then, please concentrate on your attack.\r\nKofuki: Of course! C'mon, aradama-chan, show me a good time!\r\nAradama: GUGGGIII... SHAAAAAAA!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: (If the structure of an aradama is similar to that of a living creature, I believe a blow to the head could effectively finish it.)\r\nTsugumi: (However, the reason aradama resemble living creatures is still unclear. Additionally, more data is neccessary to determine whether blows to the head are a more efficient means of suppression.)\r\nTsugumi: (I would like to continue collecting data on this case and make a better judgment from the findings. However, to avoid exposing toji to unnecessary risks, I believe it will take some time.)\r\nTsugumi: Phew... That should do for now.\r\nTsugumi: If I'm being honest, it's an awfully rough hypothesis. But, considering the help I've been given, I hope the results will be worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/evNvCiMwU_E\r\n[Xmas' 19 - Tsugumi: Start]: With Our Caroling\r\n\r\nMihono: Wow-! Come take a look! There's so many tasty looking cakes!\r\nKofuki: Whoa! This pudding looks good as hell!\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono, Shichinosato Kofuki, we did not come here today to eat cakes.\r\nTsugumi: We're here to rent choir costumes for the Christmas Eve party, remember?\r\nMihono: Ahh, oh yeah. Sorry about that. The cakes just looked so good I couldn't help it.\r\nTsugumi: You know, you wouldn't think it outside, but this cafe is fairly expansive, isn't it. The interior design has a meticulous feeling to it as well.\r\nMirja: It's meant to be a popular cosplay cafe that allows you to enjoy meals while dressed in costumes specially selected by the cafe owner.\r\nMihono: That sounds fun! Since we're here already, want to have some tea together?\r\nTsugumi: I would love to do that, Asakura-san, but don't you think it would be best to use our spare time practicing singing our carols?\r\nMihono: Oh yeah! We haven't even practiced at all yet, have we. We've gotta back to school as soon as we get the costumes.\r\nKofuki: Geh, it's just a party between friends, so nobody'll care if we phone it in, right?\r\nMirja: That won't do. Shichinosato Kofuki. You have an obligation to entertain the party, as compensation for eating my pudding the other day without asking.\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san, if you don't want to sing, you could always replace Kitora-san's pudding. Though, that pudding was a highly rare limited item. There's no guarantee you'd be able to find another...\r\nKofuki: Tch! Whatever. I'll do it, alright? If that's what it takes, I'm gonna sing my heart out!\r\nCafe Owner: Thank you for waiting. You girls are the choir group that was coming, aren't you? If you're going to be singing at a Christmas party, I think these costumes would be a good fit, but what do you say?\r\nMihono: Whoa-! They're cute! I'd be happy getting to sing wearing something this nice!\r\nTsugumi: From the careful stitching to the elaborate decorations, these are fantastic costumes. Will you really lend something this finely crafted to us free of charge?\r\nMirja: They won't be free, of course. The condition was that we repay them with labor.\r\nKofuki: We've gotta work for it!? Nobody said anything about that-!\r\nTsugumi: Kitora-san, what will we need to do as payment?\r\nMihono: Don't tell me, after the party's over, we'll have to wash dishes here forever...\r\nCafe Owner: Relax, I wouldn't ask for something so severe. What I'd like for you to do is perform your carols here at our shop. How does that sound?\r\nMirja: On the 25th, when we return these costumes, this cafe will be hosting a Christmas event. There, you will wear your costumes and sing carols.\r\nMihono: That's it? That'll be easy then! Right, Fukki?\r\nKofuki: Yeah, I'm glad to hear they're not breaking our backs over it. Singing's no big deal; I can sing as many songs as they want.\r\nMirja: We have an agreement then. On the toji party on the 24th, and here at the cafe event on the 25th, please do your best to liven up both events with your caroling.\r\nMihono/Tsugumi: Okay!\r\n\r\nMihono: Just when we felt like practicing, they told us we can't use the music room. It's too bad, isn't it-.\r\nTsugumi: There's nothing we could do about it. The chorus club is putting in their final preparations for the end of the year choir event.\r\nKofuki: So, where do we start with practicing carols now? \r\nTsugumi: First, to understand what position we're starting from, why don't we sing through our songs?\r\nMihono: Okaaay! Then, I'll put on the background music CD, so let's sing along with it!\r\nMihono/Tsugumi/Kofuki: [singing]\r\nTsugumi: Hmm, I'm sorry to say this, but we don't exactly have the voices of angels, do we.\r\nKofuki: With the two of you going all into falsetto, we weren't getting anywhere near enough volume!\r\nTsugumi: That's true; because we're singing in a different register than usual, we may need to train our throats more.\r\nTsugumi: Ah! I've just thought of something good! Let's move our practice to tomorrow. I'll prepare a special medicine for us by then.\r\nMihono: A-A special medicine!?\r\nKofuki: I've got a real bad feeling about where this is going...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Xmas' 19 - Tsugumi: End]: Harmony Resounding Through the Holy Night\r\n\r\nThe next day.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Thank you for your patience, everyone. Before we begin today's training, please try this throat lozenge.\r\nMihono: Uhh... It's got this weird color I can't really describe. Did you maybe make these yourself, Tsugumi-san...?\r\nTsugumi: That's right. I took ingredients that were said to be good for the throat, ground them to a paste, and kneaded them into corn syrup.\r\nKofuki: There's no way that's going in my mouth, alright!\r\nMihono: I-I practiced real hard by myself yesterday to bring my voice out, so I'll be fine without having to have one of those... Or something.\r\nTsugumi: I see. I was fairly proud of how these turned out too...\r\nYui: [sniff sniff]... Something sweet is in the air... And so I followed my nose, and it led me to a meetup of my sweet honeys! My intuition's super on the mark~!\r\nTsugumi: Yamashiro-san. You came at the perfect time. Would you like to have a snack?\r\nYui: Can I!?  Ah! Are these sweets you made yourself, Tsugumi-san!?\r\nTsugumi: Yes. I tried creating special-made lozenges that were gentle on the throat, but the others said they didn't need them...\r\nYui: In that case, I'll eat them up! Om nom nom...\r\nYui: Wahh-! What's with this!? It's sweet and bitter and sour and burns and it's salty!\r\nYui: The outside is crunchy, but it melts on the inside, and afterwards there's this wave of a fluffy and crackling sensation!\r\nKofuki: What's any of that mean!? I can't even picture the taste!\r\nMihono: Yui, your face turned bright red; are you okay?\r\nYui: Uwah----! I can feel power gushing up in me, and I feel like shouting at the top of my lungs~!\r\nTsugumi: Hmhm, the effects are already showing in such a short timeframe. It seems I can call this highly successful.\r\nYui: Ahh~! I want to shout! Shout my heart out! AHHHH~~~~~~~~~~!\r\nMihono: Sh-She's so loud! Yui's singing is making the windows rattle-! Tsuguki-san's lozenges might actually be amazing!\r\nYui: Whoa; what's going on! I can sing kobushi so well now it's funny~! Give me any enka song and I feel like I could sing it! HAA~~~~~~~~~!\t\t[Kobushi is a technique used in singing enka, where a single syllable is sung while moving between several different notes in succession]\r\nYui: Ahh~! I want to sing out across the sea of Japan! My body's itching to try it~! I can't take it anymore! I'm on my way!\r\nMihono: And she's gone...\r\nTsugumi: She sure is... Though, thanks to Yamashiro-san's sudden appearance, I was able to prove the potency of these lozenges. Now, you two, try some as well!\r\nKofuki: Wait, hold up! I'll give you that they were effective as hell, but wasn't that deep singing voice of hers totally wrong for caroling?\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah, that's right. We're singing carols here, not enka, so maybe practicing on our own efforts is the best way to go...\r\nTsugumi: You think so? I managed to come up with something useful, so it would be a shame not to use them... But, if you both say so, then we can work at it that way.\r\nMihono/Kofuki: Phew...\r\n\r\nDecember 25th.\r\n\r\nMirja: You performed well at yesterday's Christmas Eve party. Now I would like for you to maintain that effort and entertain this venue with your caroling.\r\nTsugumi: Of course.\r\nMirja: Hm? Ban Tsugumi, what's the matter with the two of them?\r\nTsugumi: About that... It might be because the scale of the event is greater than they were expecting, but they seem to be nervous...\r\nKofuki: I-I'm not nervous or anything, y'know. But you're nuts if you think the three of us are gonna liven up all these customers!\r\nMihono: Fukki's right here. Yesterday, all the toji waved lightsticks to pump up the mood, but today we've gotta sing without anything like that...\r\nMirja: It's true that, in these unfamiliar circumstances, I can understand feeling nervous...\r\nTsugumi: For the time being, why don't we let in some fresh air and try to freshen up.\r\nKofuki: Oi! It's gonna be freezing if you open a window!\r\nMihono: Yeah. I'm getting bad enough cold feet as it is...\r\nTsugumi: Ah-- It's... Everyone, please look outside!\r\nKofuki: Whoa, it's snowing! It's pure white out there!\r\nMirja: It's truly a fine white Christmas now.\r\nTsugumi: By pure chance, we now have a fantastic backdrop for our performance. I'm sure we'll be able to carol well again today.\r\nMihono: That's for sure. It'd be a waste to be feeling nervous singing in someplace this romantic looking! Let's have as much fun as we can with it!\r\nTsugumi: Sure. Now then, let's go out. Our choir is taking the stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/hYaqFwGk9SI\r\n[Misogi - Tsugumi: Start]: Chasing the Mysteries of Aradama\r\n\r\nTsugumi: [sippp, sippp... slurrrp...]\r\nTsugumi: Mmm, this is no good.\r\nKofuki: Oh, you finally realized how bad that stuff is? Even if it's nutritious, it tastes like crap.\r\nTsugumi: Hm? What are you talking about? These packs are great tasting and perfectly nutritious; the complete portable meal.\r\nKofuki: ...Huh? Wait, so what's no good then?\r\nTsugumi: The fact that I've been ignoring a possibility up until now, is all.\r\nTsugumi: I realized something. Haven't there been an awful lot of cases of aradama stealing things recently?\r\nTsugumi: And, from a possibility in that... I've formed a hypothesis!\r\nKofuki: Ooh, some new way to run into tons of aradama-chan!?\r\nTsugumi: Which is, is it possible that, when a subset of aradama steal objects from humans, they're wanting human attention?\r\nTsugumi: Even when aradama steal objects, I don't believe they use them in any way.\r\nTsugumi: What do you think, Shichinosato-san? About my \"attention seeking aradama\" theory!\r\nKofuki: You're looking all smug about it... but I really don't care.\r\nTsugumi: Ehh, but don't you think it's extraordinarily bad that something this vital was overlooked until now-?\r\nKofuki: I said I don't care! Did you call me here just to tell me that...?\r\nTsugumi: I'd like your help in collecting data on aradama, the same as usual-.\r\nTsugumi: To test my earlier theory, I think we'll need a certain amount of concrete data as proof-- for example, what do they actually steal?\r\nKofuki: So you're saying I'll get to play with loads of aradama-chan!\r\nTsugumi: Yes, though, the thing is... For this assignment, I'll need you to fight without bringing the aradama down right away, while limiting damage to the surroundings as much as possible.\r\nTsugumi: Because the primary goal of this is observation, not defeating the aradama. Can you work around that?\r\nKofuki: Hell no! Why do I gotta sit around waiting in a fight?\r\nTsugumi: If you hold yourself back a little, won't it feel 2-3 times more enjoyable when you do defeat the aradama?\r\nKofuki: Yeah right. Call me up when you're done with this watch-'n-wait borefest.\r\nTsugumi: Hmm, her reaction was within expectations. Though, collecting data on my own...\r\nTsugumi: The best case would be to find someone who might have a different sort of interest in aradama than Shichinosato-san...\r\nTsugumi: !\r\n\r\nEllen: So that's why you gave me a call then, Tsugumin!\r\nTsugumi: Yes, because of your personal views on aradama. I was sure you would be interested.\r\nEllen: Yes! This theory that aradama are stealing things because they want attention from people, it's very interesting!\r\nEllen: I think it sounds plausible too.\r\nTsugumi: If my hypothesis is correct, and there are aradama with the nature to seek out humans of their own accord, it may even be possible for some to be tamed as pets.\r\nEllen: That's right. It'd be wonderful if it could be more common for aradama to have relationships like Kaoru and Nene do.\r\nEllen: I'll help you with this, Tsugumin. Do you have any ideas where there might be aradama looking for attention?\r\nTsugumi: I've already taken care of researching that. So then, shall we go-?\r\nEllen: Let's go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Misogi - Tsugumi: End]: Trial and Error Towards a Dream\r\n\r\nTsugumi: From what a local farmer said, there are frequent cases of aradama stealing their crops.\r\nEllen: There don't seem to be any attacks on people either. The theory's sounding more and more credible!\r\nTsugumi: Yes. It's considered impossible for aradama to grow accustomed to humans, but this shows promise, doesn't it-. I'm feeling inspired now-.\r\nEllen: Take a look at the lettuce scattered around here! It couldn't have happened naturally, and there's no signs of it being eaten!\r\nAradama: ......\r\nTsugumi: This looks to be a bingo, fufu.\r\nTsugumi: Though, you know, these aradama stealing crops and running off into the mountains are somewhat like monkeys, aren't they-.\r\nEllen: Like monkeys, we might be able to get along with them! Rather than a troupe of apes, it's a troupe of aradama!\r\nTsugumi: Gathering data here is a step towards that.\r\nTsugumi: If we can find something resembling an aradama nest here, we can investigate whether they've collected man-made objects and so on... Though maybe I'm hoping for too much just yet.\r\nEllen: We'll just have to pray we get lucky~.\r\nEllen: Let's close the distance quick so they won't escape, and get some data while we're at it!\r\nTsugumi: Woo-!\r\nTsugumi: That's how excited I am now, to shout that-.\r\n\r\nEllen: It looks like there's stuff besides stolen crops littered around.\r\nTsugumi: From what we've confirmed from missions so far, aside from sometimes stealing food, they also steal a variety of things, from items that cover daily needs to objects made of processed metals.\r\nEllen: We can't be sure the aradama are responsible for all of this, and I don't see any rhyme or reason behind it, but couldn't this be enough to say aradama are interested in humans, in a way?\r\nTsugumi: I think it's plenty of basis to do a practical test of our hypothesis with that aradama.\r\nAradama: ......\r\nTsugumi: Alright, let's get closer. If the theory holds up, so long as we don't attack, it should be fine.\r\nEllen: Come on, let's be friends!\r\nTsugumi: There's nothing to be afraid of-.\r\nEllen: We can get along with Nene, so surely other aradama can do it too...\r\nAradama: ......\r\nAradama: KSHAAAAAAAAA!\r\nTsugumi: ...So this was no good.\r\nEllen: That was even more shocking than getting attacked by aradama usually is...\r\nTsugumi: If more of them are coming out, we can't give up hope just yet!\r\nAradama: GUGGGGIII...!\r\n\r\nEllen: That was exhausting...\r\nTsugumi: They were all duds. I wonder if this hypothesis was incorrect... Either way, Kohagura-san. Thank you very much for joining me here.\r\nEllen: I had fun too, so it's no problem!\r\nTsugumi: That's good then. Still, for what reason do aradama steal objects-? Causing that much disturbance will mean toji are sent to exorcise them...\r\nTsugumi: Ah...! It couldn't be that they're doing things to draw attention so that they can be exorcised, is it...?\r\nTsugumi: Mmmghh...\r\nEllen: You sure are dedicated to this, Tsugumin. What are you hoping to do by learning so much about aradama?\r\nTsugumi: I want to find peaceful uses for aradama... Achieving some form of coexistence is my dream. It might be little more than a fantasy of mine now, but I'm serious about it-.\r\nEllen: Oh! Tsugumin! Your dream is the same as mine! We're like-minded comrades!\r\nTsugumi: Well now-. That's a pleasant surprise-.\r\nTsugumi: I'd like to ask if we could share more information from now on, if that's alright with you, Kohagura-san.\r\nEllen: Of course it is!\r\nTsugumi: Good, this should help me make progress in data gathering. Now then, on the way back, how about we discuss my idea from earlier-?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Summer Uniform 20 - Tsugumi: Start]:\r\n\r\nTsugumi: We'll be... cleaning the pool?\r\nYomi: Yes.

She's as tough as you'd expect...\r\nImperial Guard B: Even so, the area is being surrounded by the imperial guard. There's nowhere for her to run.\r\nIchikishima: --Yukari. The enemy has brought reinforcements.\r\nYukari: So they have.\r\nImperial Guard C: Origami Yukari! You can give up now!\r\nYukari: --Heh.\r\nImperial Guard C: Do you find this funny!?\r\nYukari: No... We just seem to have reinforcements of our own.\r\nImperial Guard C: Huh...?\r\nImperial Guard C: --Ahh!!\r\nKanami: Yukari-sama! Sorry we're late!\r\nMai: We'll keep them busy! Please take Ichikishimahime and escape!\r\nKaoru: Go on ahead; we'll handle things here!\r\nKaoru: ...I've always wanted to use that line.\r\nYukari: --Sorry about this.\r\nImperial Guard C: Stop-!\r\nSayaka: ...You aren't getting past.\r\nEllen: Not unless you deal with us first!\r\nImperial Guard C: Gr...!!\r\nHiyori: I hope you're ready, imperial guard.\r\nKanami: Everyone! Let's do this! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Satsuki Yomi (1)\r\n\r\nWhile that was happening, in Kashima's industrial district, the three former elite guards were--\r\n\r\nImperial Guard A: Shidou Maki! Prepare yourself-!\r\nMaki: --HAAHH-!!\r\nImperial Guard A: GYAAAAAAA!!\r\nMaki: ...Yukari-sama should be somewhere here in this industrial area.\r\nSuzuka: However, with the imperial guard appearing one after another, we aren't able to get any searching done.\r\nYume: Why do they keep throwing themselves at us when they're so weak?\r\nMaki: Maybe they think they can beat us if they attack consecutively for long enough. Or maybe...\r\nSuzuka: They have a reason to stall us however they can.\r\nSuzuka: For example... If they're waiting for the arrival of a toji skilled enough to defeat us.\r\nYume: No way, Suzuka-onee-san. There's nobody in this mishmash of toji who could do anything to us~!\r\nMaki: ...No, there is someone. More than likely, she's the one leading the imperial guard right now--\r\nSuzuka: Yes, just her.\r\nMaki: I guess we now know why they're stalling us.\r\nYume: Those aradama... They're Yomi-onee-san's!?\r\nMaki: That's right. But she doesn't seem to be here to greet us.\r\nSuzuka: In that case, we can drag out Yomi-san after we finish with these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Satsuki Yomi (2)\r\n\r\nMaki: That should be all these aradama disposed of.\r\nSuzuka: Which leaves us with finding Yomi-san...\r\nYume: Ah!! Look!! Yomi-onee-san's over there!!\r\nYomi: ...Tsubakuro-san? Is that really you, Tsubakuro-san...?\r\nYume: It's me! Yomi-onee-san! Let's go back to being the elite guard with all four of us again!\r\nYomi: ......\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Uchizato Ayumu (1)\r\n\r\nAt that time, in Kashima's industrial district, Etou Kanami and the girls of Ichikishimahime's main rescue team were--\r\n\r\nEllen: HYAHH!!\r\nKaoru: KIEEEEEE!!\r\nNene: NE NEEEE!\r\nSayaka: ...There's so many reinforcements.\r\nHiyori: I know, every time I turn around there's more.\r\nKanami: There's just no end to them...\r\nKaoru: We're trying to go a little easy on them here, but they're coming with all they've got.\r\nEllen: Kaoru, complaining won't get them to change their minds!\r\nKaoru: I know that. But after this is over, nothing's stopping me from getting a vacation!\r\nNene: Nenne-!!\r\nKaoru: Sayaka! When we go on vacation, I'm getting my revenge on you in table tennis, okay!\r\nSayaka: ...Okay.\r\nMai: It really does feel like they could keep coming forever...\r\nMai: --Kanami-chan! Hiyori-chan! The four of us can manage here, so you two should go guard Yukari-sama and Ichikishimahime!\r\nKanami: Got it! Let's go, Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: Right!\r\nImperial Guard: Stop right there! You won't get to do as you please!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Uchizato Ayumu (2)\r\n\r\nHiyori: Finally, they're out of the way...\r\nKanami: Now to catch up to Yukari-sama and Ichikishimahime--\r\nAyumu: Etou-san!\r\nKanami: ...Ayumu-chan?\r\nAyumu: I've been waiting so long for this! For the day I could fight you!\r\nKanami: Ayumu-chan...!\r\nHiyori: Kanami! Aren't you coming!?\r\nKanami: --Sorry, Hiyori-chan! Go ahead without me!\r\nHiyori: ............Fine then.\r\nAyumu: Come on, let's fight, Etou-san! A serious clash of our skills!\r\nKanami: ......\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: We Won't Let You Go! (1)\r\n\r\nImperial Guard: Don't let Origami Yukari and Ichikishimahime escape! After them!\r\nKaoru: Whoa, hold it right there! You're not getting an inch past me!\r\nKaoru: ...Hnnng~! I always wanted to say that one too.\r\nImperial Guard: Grgh... You think you can get in our way...!\r\nEllen: We did something like this before too, didn't we. When we entered the Origami estate and let Kanamin and the others go on ahead.\r\nMai: Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan are without a doubt our strongest fighters.\r\nMai: So, no matter what it takes, I know we have to help them reach Yukari-sama.\r\nSayaka: Mm. If that's what you think, Mai, then I'll trust you.\r\nSayaka: I'll defeat everyone who tries to stop them.\r\nImperial Guard: Just try if you think you can!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: We Won't Let You Go! (2)\r\n\r\nEllen: Phew... I think that's about half of the guards here taken care of.\r\nSayaka: There will be reinforcements coming. We have to stay on guard.\r\nMai: Yukari-sama made it away, so when the timing is right, we might be able to retreat as well.\r\nKaoru: --Huh? Oi, wasn't Kanami supposed to go protect Origami Yukari? Isn't that her in a 1v1 over there?\r\nSayaka: Yes. ...That girl seems different to Kanami than the other toji.\r\nKaoru: What does that have to do with anything? What the hell is she thinking at a time like this...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: A Strike Full of Feeling (1)\r\n\r\nKanami: --Ayumu-chan! Please, just stop fighting!\r\nAyumu: But why! This is my mission, and we're toji, and toji fight together!\r\nAyumu: I got stronger so I could fight with you, Etou-san! I have to fight with everything I have!\r\nKanami: (It's no use... I can't talk sense into her...)\r\nKanami: (Because of the noro, she's not acting rationally...)\r\nKanami: ...Is this the strength you wanted, Ayumu-chan?\r\nAyumu: Yes! The strength I got so I could fight you, Etou-san!\r\nAyumu: I'm strong now, aren't I!?\r\nKanami: ...Okay. Then I can't fight with you, Ayumu-chan.\r\nAyumu: ......!? Why not!?\r\nKanami: ...When we first met, when I found out how much you liked swordfighting too, I was really happy.\r\nKanami: I thought we could have fun getting stronger together.\r\nAyumu: Fun...? I don't understand what you're saying!\r\nAyumu: Come on, Etou-san!! Please... Please fight with me!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: A Strike Full of Feeling (2)\r\n\r\nAyumu: Urgh...\r\nKanami: --I just put all my feelings into that strike.\r\nKanami: Because I know you'll be able to take it.\r\nKanami: ...I'm sorry, Ayumu-chan. I have to go after Yukari-sama.\r\nKanami: ...Let's have another match someday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: Elite Guard VS Elite Guard (1)\r\n\r\nMaki: Yomi...\r\nSuzuka: What are you doing to yourself, without utsushi...\r\nYomi: ...I have no more of my life to give if I hope to defeat you.\r\nYume: You're serious about this, Yomi-onee-san.\r\nYomi: I am. Please come at me with the intent to kill. I will do the same.\r\nSuzuka: --!? You'd let the noro eat away at your body just to be strengthened by an aradama...!?\r\nMaki: Stop it, Yomi! You can still come back from this!\r\nYomi: What about you, Shidou-san? Will you be fine repressing the aradama in you?\r\nMaki: I will! Because I have people I can rely on more than aradama now!\r\nSuzuka: Well, as sappy as that was, I'll accept the flattery.\r\nYomi: ...I don't mind if you resent me for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: Elite Guard VS Elite Guard (2)\r\n\r\nYomi: Urgh...\r\nSuzuka: You may resent me as well... Yomi-san.\r\nSuzuka: ...There's no coming back for you, is there...\r\nYomi: ...No, there isn't.\r\nYomi: No matter how twisted the path, as long as she walks it...\r\nYume: Ah... Yomi-onee-san!\r\nMaki: She left. So that's it...\r\nSuzuka: Yes...\r\nYume: She looked like she made up her mind. I thought that the four of us could finally be back together again.\r\nYume: Why would Yomi-onee-san act like that...?\r\nMaki: ...Yomi was unique even among the elite guard.\r\nMaki: Maybe we should have been trying harder to understand her.\r\nSuzuka: Yomi-san was likely fighting for a different purpose than we were.\r\nSuzuka: ...Here, let's resume our search for Yukari-sama...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13: At Kashima Shrine (1)\r\n\r\nIchikishima: ...Kashima Shrine. Dedicated to Takemikazuchi, god of thunder and martial arts.\r\nYukari: And the birthplace of Kashima Shinto-ryu. I've visited here before, together with Kagari and Yuzuki.\r\nIchikishima: ......\r\nYukari: What's the matter?\r\nIchikishima: Kagari, Yuzuki. They are the humans you need... While, I...\r\nYukari: ...Why do you think I was able to hold onto myself for the twenty years I remained host to the great aradama?\r\nYukari: Because of you... Because you were there with me, Ichikishimahime.\r\nIchikishima: Me...?\r\nYukari: Tormented by the severity of Tagitsuhime and the rationality of Takirihime, my humanity was fading day by day.\r\nYukari: But because of you... Because I had the cautious, timid, and self-defeating Ichikishimahime within me, I was able to stay human.\r\nYukari: You aren't an unnecessary existence. More than anyone else... I need you.\r\nIchikishima: Yukari...\r\nMihono: --Ahh!! Yukari-sama!! I finally found you!!\r\nYukari: Asakura... The girl chosen by Kiyomitsu.\r\nYukari: I see... So you came. Carrying the end of an unbreakable sword within you, you came here, now.\r\nYukari: It's too much to call coincidence. The will, the fate, of Kashuu Kiyomitsu. That's what this is.\r\nYukari: Fufu... So that's why. After twenty years, I understand at last.\r\nMihono: Huh? Uhhh, what are you...\r\nYukari: Asakura Mihono!! Get back!!\r\nMihono: Huh-!?\r\nTagitsu: --Have you been well? I've longed to see you, Ichikishimahime.\r\nMihono: Tagitsuhime... And the imperial guard with her...!!\r\nTagitsu: Ichikishimahime, become mine. In doing so, I shall grant you meaning.\r\nYukari: Tagitsuhime... I won't allow it!!\r\nImperial Guard A: Tagitsuhime-sama! Please, leave this to us!\r\nImperial Guard B: Origami Yukari! Ichikishimahime! Prepare yourselves!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14: At Kashima Shrine (2)\r\n\r\nImperial Guard A: Ngh...!! So strong...!!\r\nTagitsu: ...You're in my way.\r\nImperial Guard A: AGHHHHH!!\r\nImperial Guard B: Tagitsuhime-sama... Why...\r\nTagitsuhime: Enough of these games. I will take you myself.\r\nYukari: Gagh!!\r\nIchikishima: Yukari-!!\r\nYukari: ...Ichikishimahime, I'll give you time. Hurry and get away from here.\r\nIchikishima: Kh...!!\r\nIchikishima: Yukari... Just hold on!\r\nYukari: Good... That's it.\r\nYukari: Asakura Mihono, you run as well.\r\nMihono: --I won't.\r\nYukari: What...!?\r\nMihono: Yukari-sama!! I'll stay with you... I'll fight!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15: Sword of the Thunder God (1)\r\n\r\nAt that time, only a short distance away from Kashima Shrine--\r\n\r\nIchikishima: Juujou-- Hiyori.\r\nHiyori: --Huh!?\r\nHiyori: You... You're Ichikishimahime!? Why are you here, alone...\r\nIchikishima: I want you to lend me your power.\r\nIchikishima: --No, I want to entrust my power to you.\r\nHiyori: Grh!!\u3000Don't be ridiculous!! You're just another part of Tagitsuhime!!\r\nHiyori: Just the same great aradama that made my mother suffer!! So, why would I!\r\nIchikishima: Even so, I want to entrust myself to you, Juujou Hiyori.\r\nIchikishima: ...I want to save Origami Yukari, who said I was needed.\r\nHiyori: Kh.........\r\n\r\nYukari: Asakura Mihono! Run away! You stand no chance against her!\r\nMihono: I'll be fine!! Where there's a will, there's a way!!\r\nTagitsuhime: It does not bother me. There is no great difference whether I swat one fly or two.\r\nTagitsuhime: Try to entertain me some, will you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16: Sword of the Thunder God (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Pant... Pant...\r\nTagitsuhime: You put up a short fight, but even with two you could not hope to defeat me.\r\nTagitsuhime: Just a woman outliving her time. Even so, you were once my... No, nothing more than a broken vessel now.\r\nYukari: Ngh...!!\r\nTagitsuhime: Now then, it's time you died.\r\nTagitsuhime: ...!?\r\nYukari: Takemikazuchi...? --It can't be!?\r\nYukari: Kogarasumaru... Juujou Hiyori...\r\nMihono: Juujou-san!? Wait, that's Juujou-san!?\r\nTagitsuhime: So you've found yourself a new vessel, Ichikishimahime...\r\nTagitsuhime: Then, I will draw back.\r\nMihono: Tagitsuhime... You scared her off, Juujou-san!\r\nHiyori: --Don't come near me!!\r\nMihono: -!? Wh-Why!?\r\nHiyori: Urgh... AGHHHHH!!\r\nYukari: This isn't good!! Juujou Hiyori doesn't have control over the aradama's power!!\r\nHiyori: Ugh... Ghrh... AAAGGHHH!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17: Sword of the Thunder God (3)\r\n\r\nHiyori: Aghh... Ahh...!!\r\nMihono: Juujou-san... Does it hurt...?\r\nYukari: ...After using her power, she seems to have calmed down some. Though...\r\nKanami: --Hiyori-chaaaan!! Yukari-sama!!\r\nMihono: Kanami!?\r\nKanami: Ah! Mihono-chan, you're here too!\r\nKanami: What's going on? What happened here? Ichikishimahime, where is she?\r\nKanami: --!?\r\nKanami: H-Hiyori-chan...!?\r\nYukari: ...The person before you is both Juujou Hiyori and Ichikishimahime.\r\nKanami: Huh!?\r\nYukari: Juujou Hiyori has absorbed the great aradama. The same as I once did.\r\nHiyori: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: The Source of the Lightning?\r\n\r\nChie: ...Did anyone else see that!?\r\nMirja: Yes... In the direction of Kashima Shrine... That was... Clearly not a natural phenomenon.\r\nKofuki: No way, with that bigass lightning strike. Must have had something to do with an aradama. And a big shot too.\r\nMirja: Then... Tagitsuhime? Still, why would such a massive lightning strike occur...\r\nKiyoka: I don't know... What if, something happened to Hono-chan...\r\nChie: Mihono-chan...\r\nMirja: Did I misjudge the situation, sending Asakura Mihono there alone...? Another of my mistakes...\r\nKofuki: Oi, Mirja. It's too early for that stuff! We don't even know anything yet.\r\nKofuki: I'm tired of fighting people, and things are looking interesting over there. Come on, guys! Let's check out where that lightning hit!"}, {"paste_key": "3JEWXRc2", "title": "3-8 Ichikishimahime's Encirclement", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/3JEWXRc2", "timestamp": "", "hits": "112", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/fSEJRsLOZ8M\r\n\r\n1: Waste of a Toji (1)\r\n\r\nAt that time, on the north side of Choshi--\r\n\r\nMihono: --Ever since we started going north, we've ran into so many imperial guards.\r\nMirja: The imperial guards who scattered in their search for Ichikishimahime appear to be gathering towards Kashima.\r\nMirja: It's better that we reduce the enemy's numbers while they're spread apart. Though, conversely, fighting the imperial guard each time we see them is delaying our arrival...\r\nMihono: --Ah! More guards showed up!\r\nImperial Guard A: Are you the investigation team!? The villains opposing Tagitsuhime-sama...!!\r\nImperial Guard B: --Wait? Isn't that... That famous prodigy, Musumi Kiyoka!?\r\nKiyoka: -!!\r\nImperial Guard C: You know her?\r\nImperial Guard B: I sure do. She's the daughter of a family with a prestigious dojo, and they wouldn't stop talking about how this prodigal swordfighting girl had a bright future as a toji.\r\nImperial Guard B: But even with all that fanfare, when they put her into combat, she was so scared of the aradama that she was totally useless.\r\nImperial Guard B: Basically, even with all her talent, she's worthless. Just a waste of a toji, who can't do anything in a real fight.\r\nImperial Guard B: If Musumi Kiyoka's a part of the investigation team, maybe they're not as tough as everyone's been saying.\r\nMihono: Now they're making me mad... Hey!! You can't talk like that--\r\nChie: Calm down, Mihono-chan. They're trying to break our composure by provoking us like that.\r\nChie: If we let our anger get the better of us and charge in, it'll be giving them what they want.\r\nMihono: Ugh... I-I didn't know. That was a close one...\r\nKofuki: Anyway, there should be even more guards meeting at where Yukari-sama is right now. We don't have time for this.\r\nKofuki: Me and Kiyoka are more than enough to handle them. You three keep on going.\r\nMihono: Eh-!? But...\r\nMirja: (...Shichinosato Kofuki may have some plan in mind.)\r\nMirja: (It's possible that she has noticed Musumi Kiyoka's hesitation as well...)\r\nMirja: ...Asakura Mihono. We will leave the guards here to Shichinosato Kofuki and Musumi Kiyoka.\r\nMihono: You're agreeing with her, Mirja-san!?\r\nMirja: Our objective is to rescue Origami Yukari-sama. All our efforts will be for nothing if we confuse our priorities and arrive too late to make a difference.\r\nMihono: I-I get it.\r\nChie: Then, we'll be going on ahead, Kofuki-chan, Kiyoka-chan. Be sure to catch up quick, okay?\r\nKofuki: Just look at them; we'll be back before you know it.\r\nImperial Guard A: Hey, hold it right there! We're not letting you--\r\nKofuki: You trash are staying right here with us!\r\nImperial Guard B: Did you just call us trash...!?\r\nKofuki: Compared to Kiyoka here, you're all bottom of the barrel! If you don't like the sound of that, then why don't you come find out just how much of a \"waste of a toji\" she is!\r\nKofuki: Come on, Kiyoka! Let's show 'em what someone who used to be useless can do!\r\nKiyoka: ...Okay!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Waste of a Toji (2)\r\n\r\nImperial Guard B: A Myouga toji like myself, losing to that waste of a toji...\r\nKofuki: Haha-! Nice going, Kiyoka! See, you can do it after all!\r\nKiyoka: ...Thank you, Kofuki-san. You said the two of us would stay behind because you wanted to give me confidence, didn't you?\r\nKofuki: I-I wasn't thinking about that! I was just...\r\nKiyoka: Fufu.\r\nKofuki: Oi, cut it out! Don't laugh like you think you understand everything!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: 20 Years for Souraku Yuzuki\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in the rural area on the north side of Choshi--\r\n\r\nYuzuki: It's been so long... Though I suppose I can't say that. Until recently, I was researching noro right alongside you.\r\nYuzuki: But the last time I saw you fully yourself was over twenty years ago, wasn't it...\r\nYuzuki: Twenty years ago... In front of the toji who fell victim to the disaster at Sagami Bay, I lamented how simple it was for people to die.\r\nYuzuki: Through injury in battle, through disease-- Why did human life have to be lost so easily?\r\nYuzuki: From then, in opposition to the world's unfairness, I devoted everything I had to the research of noro.\r\nYuzuki: I had a dream I wanted to realize, even if it meant turning my back on the right path and walking down the wrong one.\r\nYuzuki: ...But the truth of that dream, which I thought was so noble, was only the ugly and misguided extent of my egotism.\r\nYuzuki: And I forced my ego on those girls.\r\nYukari: ...You weren't waiting for me here only so you could reminisce on old times, were you?\r\nYuzuki: No... I had faith you would repel the imperial guard, protect Ichikishimahime, and make it here to me.\r\nYuzuki: --Please condemn me, Yukari.\r\nYuzuki: I've sinned too greatly. I'm so tired of it all...\r\nYuzuki: Believing it would save people, my life's work... The twenty years I gave to noro research, all it accomplished was the creation of the imperial guard.\r\nYuzuki: My life's work, believing I could save people... And the twenty years I gave to noro research, all it ultimately accomplished was my hand in the creation of the imperial guard.\r\nYuzuki: Had it not been for my research, none of those girls would have suffered becoming Myouga toji...\r\nYukari: ...Yuzuki. Don't seek the easy path of being forgiven through death.\r\nYukari: The creation of the investigation team, and their search for Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, that was you trying in your own way to stop Tagitsuhime... To stop me, who had lost control, wasn't it?\r\nYukari: ...All these years, you've spent studying noro. Shouldn't there be another way for you to atone?\r\nYuzuki: Another way for me to atone...? You're saying there's still something you'd have me do...?\r\nIchikishima: Yukari is cruel, is she not. Regardless of how tired you say you are, she will give you no rest.\r\nIchikishima: I was scolded, eariler, when I suggested to offer myself to Tagitsuhime.\r\nYukari: You shouldn't expect otherwise. As long as I live, you won't get to choose to die.\r\nYukari: --Hm? Who's there!\r\nYomi: Ichikishimahime... On my master's orders, I have come for you.\r\nYukari: ...Yomi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Mirja's Resolution (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: Was it really okay to leave Fukki and Kiyoka back there...?\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan said it was fine, so they should be alright. Let's have faith in them.\r\nMirja: It's just as Setouchi Chie says. Shichinosato Kofuki and Musumi Kiyoka are our reliable allies.\r\nMirja: We need to make the most of their consideration and proceed to join with Origami Yukari-sama as quickly as--\r\nYui: Ah, it's the girls from the investigation team!! I founnnd you!!\r\nYui: --Wait, hang on? Where's Kofuki-san and Kiyoka-chan? Did you all split up?\r\nMihono: It's Yui and Hana!?\r\nHana: Because of your team, too many of the imperial guard have been incapacitated. We won't let you go any further.\r\nMihono: Grr... We don't have time for this... We have to get to Yukari-sama fast!!\r\nMirja: ...Asakura Mihono. Setouchi Chie and myself will handle them while you go on ahead.\r\nMihono: Huh-!? That's crazy!!\r\nMihono: Last time we fought Yui and Hana, it was hard enough with all five of us--\r\nMirja: There won't be a problem. As I predict it, the two of us are capable of dealing with the imperial guard here.\r\nHana: You sure are taking us lightly now...\r\nMihono: Ch-Chii-nee. Do you really think it'll be okay...?\r\nChie: ...If Mirja-san says so, then I think we'll be fine. So go on, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee... Mirja-san....\r\nMihono: --I got it!! But you have to catch up to me as soon as you can!!\r\nYui: Aww, she actually ran off. I didn't think Mihono-chan was that heartless, abandoning you two so she could get away.\r\nMirja: We haven't been abandoned. Asakura Mihono was only able to proceed ahead because of her trust in us.\r\nHana: ...Mirja-senpai. You don't actually think you can get out of this situation, do you?\r\nMirja: I do. As I will prove now.\r\nHana: --How funny! So you can tell jokes, Mirja-senpai.\r\nYui: Mirja-san, after I win, you'll get to be all mine!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Mirja's Resolution (2)\r\n\r\nHana: Urgh... Th-They're tough...!!\r\nYui: B-But... This is all wrong...\r\nYui: If we were equal to all five of you before, we shouldn't be losing to just Chie-san and Mirja-san...\r\nMirja: There's a simple answer to your confusion. Every occasion we fought before, we couldn't bring ourselves to fight you.\r\nMirja: In my case, due to the guilt I felt over you joining the imperial guard, I subconsciously restrained myself.\r\nMirja: But, I refuse to retreat from my responsibility any longer.\r\nMirja: If I don't fight you with all I have, nothing will be resolved.\r\nMirja: The way I should be atoning for my mistake is by finding some method of extracting the noro from your bodies.\r\nHana: Y-You don't know what you're talking about! There's no reason to get rid of our noro! There's nothing that makes us happier than serving Tagitsuhime-sama!\r\nYui: That's right! You should just be Myouga toji with us, Chie-san, Mirja-san!\r\nYui: If you accept the noro, you'll be even stronger than you are now, and you'll understand just how great Tagitsuhime-sama is!\r\nMirja: That is not real strength.\r\nYui: And by joining the imperial guard, you can help so many people, people who are in trouble, people who are suffering!\r\nMirja: .........Yamashiro Yui. Suzumoto Hana. I promise you, I will find a way to return you to your former selves.\r\nChie: Sorry, you two. We need you to sleep for a while.\r\nYui: Agh...!!\r\nHana: Gh...!!\r\nMirja: You hit them with the back of the blade?\r\nChie: Yes... It seemed to knock them out well enough, but...\r\nMirja: There's no need to worry. The two of them are breathing fine. Let's hurry after Asakura Mihono.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Yukari VS Yomi (1)\r\n\r\nYuzuki: Yomi... You let me come here...?\r\nYomi: I did. I knew you would eventually contact Yukari-sama, so I followed you.\r\nYomi: Thank you for leading me to Ichikishimahime.\r\nYuzuki: Kh...!!\r\nIchikishima: Tagitsuhime has commanded this one to secure me as well?\r\nYukari: That's how it's going to be. We're leaving, before she has a chance to call the others.\r\nYomi: You aren't leaving. Yukari-sama, prepare yourself.\r\nYukari: Yomi... I never expected to be fighting you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Yukari VS Yomi (2)\r\n\r\nYomi: Nn, nng...\r\nYukari: What are you standing there for, Ichikishimahime. Yomi will regain consciousness in a moment. We're leaving!\r\nIchikishima: Yet again... You are as harsh a leader as ever.\r\nYuzuki: Yukari... For me to atone...\r\n\r\nYomi: ...Yes. They escaped.\r\nYomi: However, that is not a problem. During our fighting just now, I attached an aradama to the target. If we follow its signal, we will know where Ichikishimahime goes.\r\nYomi: From here I will take command of the imperial guard, and gather them at Ichikishimahime's location. That is the end of my report.\r\nYuzuki: Yomi...\r\nYomi: Now then, please excuse me, President Souraku.\r\nYuzuki: ...You're not going to dispose of me for my betrayal?\r\nYomi: By leading me to Ichikishimahime, you performed your duties.\r\nYuzuki: So that's it... It won't get me condemned or executed... That's the nature of my sin...\r\nYomi: To be honest, I don't care about you either way. Though, I will say this...\r\nYomi: It's entirely up to your own judgment if you want to label yourself a corrupt sinner.\r\nYomi: However, even if it may be ugly and misguided, we are the ones who chose to live this way. We will not be condemned by anyone.\r\nYuzuki: ...Even if it's ugly and misguided...\r\nYuzuki: Maybe there is something left for me to do, like Yukari said...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: The Elite Guard's Advance (1)\r\n\r\nYume: --Ahh! Maki-onee-san! There's some imperial guards over there!\r\nMaki: Right. Let's thin their numbers here.\r\nSuzuka: It's not their lucky day, coming across us.\r\nImperial Guard A: Three members of the old elite guard... Must be here to rescue Origami Yukari...\r\nImperial Guard B: I fought Tsubakuro-san at the Ministry of Defense, but she was too strong to do anything against... She's not someone we can handle...\r\nImperial Guard C: What are you losing your nerve for! We're powered by noro too now, just like them! We can fight on their level!\r\nYume: If you seriously think you can beat us, just hurry up and get it over with already.\r\nImperial Guard C: Wh-What did you say...!!\r\nYume: Well, it's not like you could win though. I can tell how weak you are just by looking.\r\nImperial Guard A: This brat! Everyone, attack!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: The Elite Guard's Advance (2)\r\n\r\nImperial Guard A: Th-They're too much...\r\nYume: Onee-sans, did you feel stronger cause you got injected with noro?\r\nYume: Even though you were all weak before, getting noro when you joined the imperial guard made you just a little stronger, right?\r\nYume: But the elite guard were ALWAYS strong, you know? Of course you never had a chance.\r\nImperial Guard C: Ngh...!\r\nImperial Guard B: Relax. So long as we capture Ichikishimahime, we win.\r\nImperial Guard C: Th-That's right! Let's fall back to the factory where we cornered Origami Yukari!\r\nYume: ...Is it me, or are they just leading us to where Yukari-sama is?\r\nMaki: Right, that's an offer we can't refuse.\r\nSuzuka: They couldn't be picky when choosing the imperial guard, after all. Even outside of battle, they're third rate.\r\nSuzuka: President Takatsu has my sympathies for trying to manage them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: Mihono Flying Solo (1)\r\n\r\nAt that time, on the north side of Choshi, near the Kashima coastline--\r\n\r\nMihono: (...I know I went on to Kashima by myself, but where in Kashima am I supposed to be going...?)\r\nMihono: (And there's so many guards around... Feels like more of them keep on showing up.)\r\nMihono: (...Maybe I should try listening in on them again, like before...)\r\nMihono: (I want to learn as much as I can for when the others catch up...)\r\n\r\nImperial Guard A: --What's happening with Origami Yukari and Ichikishimahime?\r\nImperial Guard B: They said they've been cornered in the industrial district up ahead. We've been ordered to surround the area and let no one else through.\r\nMihono: (Yukari-sama's been cornered!? I have to find a way to help her...!!)\r\nMihono: (But it'd be tough for me to do anything with all these people...)\r\nMihono: (But I don't think I can make it through here without them seeing me either...)\r\nMihono: (--Arghh!! I don't have time to think!! I just have to force my way through!!)\r\nImperial Guard A: Who's there!? ...You're Asakura Mihono, aren't you!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: Mihono Flying Solo (2)\r\n\r\nImperial Guard A: D-Damnit...\r\nImperial Guard B: Tagitsuhime-sama... I'm so sorry...\r\nMihono: I did it...! I beat them by myself cause I caught them by surprise...!\r\nMihono: Now I can make it to Yukari-sama--\r\nImperial Guard C: Hey, you! What are you doing here! That uniform, it's Minoseki's-- You're not one of us then!\r\nMihono: Uwah!? They had backup!?\r\nImperial Guard D: Did you do that to them!? Any opposition to Tagitsuhime-sama is unforgivable!\r\nMihono: Uh... Do I have to fight them too now...?\r\nMihono: But I want to get to Yukari-sama already...!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: Traces of Battle (1)\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in the rural area on the north side of Choshi--\r\n\r\nKanami: Hey, Hiyori-chan. Even though we all split up, we're not finding a single trace of Yukari-sama...\r\nKanami: The info we just got from Akane-sama said she was heading north towards Kashima...\r\nKanami: But, if we don't end up finding her, what are we supposed to do...\r\nHiyori: When did you turn so pessimistic?\r\nKanami: But, I mean, we haven't found any leads, and there's so many imperial guards out here. Of course I'd start feeling...\r\nHiyori: --!! Take your stance, Kanami!! It's the imperial guard!!\r\nImperial Guard A: You two, you're Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori! Those who wrong Tagitsuhime-sama will be shown no mercy!\r\nHiyori: We don't have a choice but to fight, by the looks of it...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13: Traces of Battle (2)\r\n\r\nHiyori: Phew... It took time, but we drove them off.\r\nKanami: --Oh! Look at this, Hiyori-chan! The ground here is weirdly blackened!\r\nHiyori: You're right, it is...\r\nKanami: I know from the times we fought her... Satsuki-san must have summoned her aradama here.\r\nKanami: Which means, the footprints here, are they Yukari-sama's...?\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan! Let's follow these footprints for now! And after... We'll use our intuition!\r\nHiyori: Intuition, really...?\r\nKanami: Ah, I got a message.\r\nKanami: ---!! It looks like Nene-chan found Ichikishimahime!! We're all going to meet up!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14: Fighting All Alone (1)\r\n\r\nAt that time, in Kashima's south end, the part of town by the industrial district--\r\n\r\nImperial Guard A: GYAAAAAH!!\r\nMihono: --Next one!!\r\nImperial Guard B: This toji, she's so strong...! How many guards has she beaten already...?\r\nImperial Guard C: I wish we could surround her and take her all at once, but since she came into this tight alley, we can't help but fight her one at a time...!!\r\nImperial Guard B: Does that mean, she calculated all of this and ran here on purpose...?\r\nImperial Guard B: I thought we had her trapped, but we were just playing into her hand...!?\r\nMihono: Hehe~h! Of course I did! Everything went just like I planned!\r\nMihono: (I was actually just chased into a dead end, but I didn't think it would be this easy to fight here!)\r\nMihono: (And now they're having some weird misunderstanding, so this might be my chance to go on the attack!)\r\nImperial Guard B: Kh...! We can't let just a single toji keep giving us such a hard time!\r\nImperial Guard B: Let's retreat to a more open position, and repair our formation!\r\nMihono: Ah-! Hey, don't do that! This place was working out so well--\r\nImperial Guard B: KYAAAA-!!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan! Sorry we took so long!\r\nMihono: Kiyoka! You made it!\r\nKofuki: Me too! And Chichie and Mirja, of course!\r\nChie: Stop saying Chichie, it's Chie!\r\nChie: --More importantly, Mihono-chan, look at all the guards you defeated by yourself...!\r\nChie: There were some guards back there talking about having trouble with an extremely strong toji, but I didn't think it was you, Mihono-chan!\r\nMirja: Thanks to Asakura Mihono's efforts in drawing the nearby guards here, it seems they weren't able to complete their encirclement of the plant where Origami Yukari is located.\r\nKiyoka: It really paid off sending you ahead, didn't it, Hono-chan!\r\nMihono: Stop complimenting me so much, it's embarrassing~... Why don't we keep up the pace then, and take on the rest of the guards around here!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15: Fighting All Alone (2)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Phew... I think we dealt with most of the guards in the area.\r\nMirja: It's a message from Origami Akane-sama.\r\nMirja: Origami Yukari-sama is currently in an industrial district in the south of Kashima, which is where the imperial guard's reinforcements appear to be heading.\r\nKofuki: She's way late! We already knew all that!\r\nKiyoka: She's only trying to help...\r\nMirja: On top of that, the main force of the rescue team, with Etou Kanami and the others, are moving to the industrial area...\r\nMirja: It seems that we should now strike at the imperial guard headed that way and reduce their numbers.\r\nChie: Then it would be best for us set up here and deal with any guards who come passing by.\r\nMirja: ...That may accomplish our objective, but I'm concerned about Ichikishimahime's situation.\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono. With the goal of scouting and providing support to the main rescue team, could you go check on the condition of Origami Yukari and Ichikishimahime while the four of us remain here?\r\nMihono: --Huh? By myself?\r\nMirja: Yes. Sending a single scout will reduce the risk of them being detected by the enemy.\r\nMirja: Of course, I do expect a great number of imperial guard to be in the industrial district, so if you feel you are in danger, please return here at once.\r\nMihono: O-Okay. ...I'll do it! I'll go see how they're doing real quick!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: The Break's Intent\r\n\r\nYukari: We could buy some time here... We're resting for a short while.\r\nIchikishima: I am glad to hear it. You have worked me to the bone, and I am exhausted.\r\nYukari: To the bone...? All you've done is run here...\r\nIchikishima: Any movement I do not wish to make is a great hardship to me. Though, Yukari.\r\nIchikishima: Hm... To take a rest here... You must be planning something by it.\r\nIchikishima: Will they come chase us this way? That way? Presumption is something always waiting with surprises. It will be worth seeing.\r\nYukari: I would prefer if you did more than just watch though..."}, {"paste_key": "cvCCgNRx", "title": "3-6 The Two from the Imperial Guard", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/cvCCgNRx", "timestamp": "", "hits": "82", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/5mRivqJnwWw\r\n\r\n1: Kiyoka's Reluctance (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: It's still hard to wrap my head around Yui and Hana being our enemies...\r\nMihono: On top of that, it looks like they really are getting noro from aradama for Tagitsuhime.\r\nKofuki: It's one thing if they're fighting us, but I'm not letting them get away with stealing my aradama-chan! They're taking all my fun!\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan, is that really what you're upset about? It's still a good thing that they're getting rid of aradama. It helps people.\r\nChie: Of course, it doesn't help that Tagitsuhime is absorbing the noro though.\r\nMirja: They said that, by taking in noro, Tagitsuhime is growing closer to a perfect form, didn't they.\r\nMirja: I believe we should do everything possible to prevent Tagitsuhime from amassing any more power...\r\nKiyoka: Even so, I don't like the idea of fighting other toji using the okatana we were given to stop aradama...\r\nChie: .........\r\nMirja: .........\r\nAcademy Intercom: Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--\r\nMirja: We've been called to arms. Everyone, let's go at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Kiyoka's Reluctance (2)\r\n\r\nKofuki: Feels great getting to mess around with aradama-chan! Good thing the imperial guard didn't crash the party this time!\r\nChie: Though the imperial guard must have noticed the aradama appearing here.\r\nChie: It'd be best if we collect the noro and leave as quick as we can.\r\nMihono: G-Good idea...\r\nMirja: Musumi Kiyoka. About our earlier conversation, on fighting with the imperial guard. On fighting against other toji.\r\nKiyoka: ...Yes?\r\nMirja: I would also like to avoid confrontation with other toji if at all possible.\r\nMirja: However, if Tagitsuhime is strengthened by the noro gathered by the imperial guard, a disaster similar to the one of 20 years ago could occur.\r\nMirja: To prevent that from happening, doesn't it seem clear we have no choice but to fight the imperial guard?\r\nKiyoka: ...I know. I know we have to, but--\r\nMihono: !? Guys, over there! The imperial guard are here!!\r\nImperial Guard: You all are the investigation team, aren't you? Give us that noro, without any resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Mirja's Concern (1)\r\n\r\nChie: The imperial guard again...!\r\nImperial Guard A: They've been talking about your investigation team. About how many times you've gotten in the way of our noro retreival.\r\nImperial Guard B: How utterly foolish! Why can't you just understand the wonder of Tagitsuhime-sama!?\r\nMihono: I can't understand what doesn't make sense in the first place! We're not giving you this noro!\r\nKiyoka: ...People from the imperial guard. We're the ones who defeated the aradama this time. Can't you just give up on this noro...?\r\nMirja: Musumi Kiyoka, it's pointless. These are not people you can reason with.\r\nImperial Guard A: Fufufu, you seem to understand your position well.\r\nImperial Guard B: Tagitsuhime-sama's orders will be carried out without fail. If you won't obey, then we will take it by force!\r\nKofuki: Dammit, are we really doing this again? I don't wanna fight anyone besides aradama-chan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Mirja's Concern (2)\r\n\r\nImperial Guard A: Urgh...! I guess you really are as strong as they say!\r\nImperial Guard B: Even so, we aren't leaving empty handed!\r\nKofuki: Oi, what do we do about them? Things'll get annoying if they attack us again, so why don't we tie 'em up and take them hostage?\r\nImperial Guard A: ...If we were taken hostage, it would cause difficulties for Tagitsuhime-sama... We'll leave it at this for now.\r\nImperial Guard B: Investigation team...! Don't think I'll forget this...!\r\nKofuki: Tch. Who do they think they are?\r\nKofuki: If they were taken hostage, Tagitsuhime wouldn't give a shit about them.\r\nChie: That just goes to show how much faith they have in her. They fully believe, if they were taken captive, Tagitsuhime would come to save them...\r\nKiyoka: And the imperial guard will just keep coming back for more noro, won't they... How long will this keep going...\r\nMihono: You look pretty worn out, Kiyoka. Are you okay...?\r\nKiyoka: I-I'm fine. I'm sorry I made you worry about me.\r\nMirja: (...Musumi Kiyoka. Even during this battle with the imperial guard, your sword hesitated.)\r\nMirja: (As I thought, she cannot bring herself to fight the imperial guard. This isn't something I can overlook...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: To Keep Your Friends Safe\r\n\r\nMirja: Musumi Kiyoka. I'd like to speak with you for a moment, if you have the time.\r\nKiyoka: --It's about how I hesitated while fighting the imperial guard, isn't it.\r\nMirja: ...So you're aware of it yourself.\r\nKiyoka: I am...\r\nKiyoka: While working as a member of the investigation team, I've become much more comfortable with fighting aradama.\r\nKiyoka: ...But, the imperial guard are toji just like us. Fighting them, the thought of hurting them, it scares me.\r\nMirja: Though, by hesitating, aren't you putting yourself in danger?\r\nKiyoka: ...I'm more afraid of hurting someone else than I am of getting hurt.\r\nMirja: I see... However, we will have no choice but to battle the imperial guard in the future.\r\nMirja: ...Musumi Kiyoka. I think it might be best if you considered leaving the investigation team.\r\nKiyoka: But...\r\nMirja: For you to continue fighting in this state can only be described as dangerous.\r\nMirja: Don't you think it would be better for you to be away from the fighting?\r\nKiyoka: I-I just...\r\nMirja: ...I'm sorry for how bluntly I've approached this.\r\nKiyoka: It's okay... I know you're just worried about me, Mirja-san...\r\nKiyoka: And you're right, it might be best if I left the investigation team...\r\nMirja: Well then. I'll leave the final decision to you. Please make up your mind before anything serious happens.\r\n\r\nMihono: Oh, Kiyoka! There you are! Was that Mirja-san with you just now?\r\nKiyoka: Mmhm...\r\nMihono: Huh? Is something wrong, Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: Ah, sorry! It's nothing!\r\nMihono: Oh okay. ...You know, I wanted to talk to you about something, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: Eh...?\r\nMihono: We're all alone here, so it's the perfect chance. I'll just say it.\r\nMihono: I don't want you to leave the investigation team.\r\nMihono: ...Fighting the imperial guard can be pretty scary, huh.\r\nKiyoka: So you noticed, Hono-chan...\r\nMihono: Yeah. I know this might sound selfish, but, what if you tried fighting just to protect us from now on?\r\nMihono: Not fighting against other toji, but fighting to keep us safe.\r\nKiyoka: To protect... You?\r\nMihono: If you left, then our overall strength is gonna go way down! We might even lose the next time we see the imperial guard!\r\nMihono: So that's why, you should fight. Just to protect us.\r\nMihono: Aha, I'm starting to feel like even I don't know what I'm saying anymore.\r\nKiyoka: But, but... What if I make things harder for everyone...\r\nMihono: We'll figure something out! Where there's a will, there's a way!\r\nKiyoka: That's what you always say, Hono-chan...\r\nMihono: But we'll all be together. That's how we made it through everything so far, right?\r\nMihono: We even went to the netherworld, and brought back Tsubakuro-san. We just have to work as a team! If we work together, we'll find a way!\r\nKiyoka: ...Okay. Thank you, Hono-chan. I think I'll try a little harder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Whereabouts Located (1)\r\n\r\nHana: --President Takatsu. You called for us?\r\nYukina: We've found where Ichikishimahime has been hiding. Summon the imperial guard.\r\nAyumu: We did it! Now's finally our chance...!\r\nYui: After she absorbs Ichikishimahime, Tagitsuhime-sama will be complete, won't she?\r\nYukina: That's exactly right. We can accomplish what we've dreamed of. Tagitsuhime-sama will surely be pleased.\r\nYukina: And for that reason, there will be no tolerance for failure here. Each of you should brace yourselves for the mission at hand.\r\nHana/Yui/Ayumu: Yes ma'am!\r\n\r\nKofuki: Anybody else feel like there's less aradama-chan around here lately?\r\nChie: Well, the imperial guard have been putting in a lot of effort to suppress aradama.\r\nKiyoka: I'm glad they're getting rid of aradama, but with that noro going to Tagitsuhime, it's a sort of mixed blessing...\r\nKofuki: Dumbass! Those are MY aradama-chan they're taking away! There's no good side to this!\r\nKofuki: Maybe I should just snap all their okatana to little pieces...!\r\nMihono: Earth to Fukki. Okatana don't break... Though, the tip of mine is broken.\r\nMirja: --The aradama designated for suppression have been sighted! Everyone, prepare for battle!\r\nKofuki: Hehehe, you don't like it either, do you, aradama-chan! Well I'll treat you just right!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Whereabouts Located (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Phew... It's been another rough day...\r\nKofuki: I didn't get my fill yet though... I miss back when the leakage incident just happened and there were still aradama-chan everywhere...\r\nKiyoka: Don't expect me to look back fondly on when things were at their worst...\r\nMihono: Why don't we get something to eat before we wash off--\r\nChie: Everyone! This is big!\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono, turn the television on right now!\r\nMihono: Wh-What!?

Then, right now, where are they...?\r\nSana: We haven't found that much out yet... We can't get in contact with them.\r\nSana: But, if we make any big moves, it could provoke the imperial guard. It would be a good idea to send out a small rescue team picked from our best.\r\nAkane: I agree. I was thinking the same thing.\r\nSana: I'll talk to Kanami and Maki.\r\nAkane: Then, I'll speak to the investigation team. ...We have to hurry!\r\nSana: Right!"}, {"paste_key": "LwZBj50J", "title": "3-7 The Conspiracy Closing in on Ichikishimahime", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/LwZBj50J", "timestamp": "", "hits": "90", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/xDnIu7talhw\r\n\r\n1: Away to Choshi\r\n\r\nTV (Reporter): The submarine thought to be carrying Ichikishimahime is currently sailing in the waters off the Boso Peninsula!\r\nTV (Reporter): From here, we will watch as the self-defense force captures the submarine and apprehends Ichikishimahime!\r\nMihono: Wh-What's going on...? Why is the self-defense force going after the submarine Yukari-sama and Ichikishimahime are on...?\r\nMirja: It's highly likely that President Takatsu has been influencing things behind closed doors.\r\nKiyoka: Then, President Takatsu got close to government officials so she could get the self-defense force involved...?\r\nKofuki: I don't get all the details, but the important part is, we're in trouble, right?\r\nChie: We are...

I promise, I will bring back good news.\r\n\r\n--At that time, on Choshi Bridge.\r\n\r\nImperial Guard A: Sh-She's too much...!!\r\nImperial Guard B: This is what it's like, to fight Origami Yukari...!!\r\nYukari: --Taking in noro can bring out your potential strength, but it can't teach you to fight a real battle.\r\nYukari: The imperial guard cannot stop me. This is reckless of you, Yukina.\r\nImperial Guard A: D-Don't let her get to you! Attack-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Strength of Yukari (2)\r\n\r\nImperial Guard A: Ggh... Ghah...\r\nIchikishima: Have you dealt with them all?\r\nYukari: If you would draw Juzumaru, we would have an easier time breaking through here.\r\nIchikishima: A momentary victory has no meaning...\r\nIchikishima: Yukari, I am tired.\r\nIchikishima: Abandoned by both Tagitsuhime and Takirihime, I remain in this world alone...\r\nYukari: If you can talk that much, you're doing fine. We're moving.\r\nIchikishima: You slave driver...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Search is On! (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: We got to Choshi in no time! That's a helicopter for you!\r\nKiyoka: But now, which way should we be going...?\u3000\r\nMirja: Though we're here to rescue them, we don't have an accurate idea of Ichikishimahime's current position.\r\nKofuki: Ichikishimahime's an aradama-chan, so can't we track her down with the spectrum finder?\r\nMirja: Unfortunately, due to the high concentration of aradama in the area, our spectrum finders won't be of any use.\r\nChie: Couldn't we call Yukari-sama and ask her directly?\r\nMirja: Origami Yukari-sama seems to have powered off her phone. There is a possibility that her phone's signal could broadcast her location to President Takatsu, after all.\r\nChie: Then that means, until we get an idea of where to go, we're waiting here...\r\nMihono: We can't just stand around! Let's follow our intuition for now!\r\nKiyoka: Your intuition? Hono-chan...\r\nKofuki: Nah, I'm with Mihocchi here. Let's go around wiping out every aradama-chan the spectrum finders pick up!\r\nKofuki: --Or I'd like to at least, but first, we've got company.\r\nMihono: Huh...? --Ahh! The imperial guard!\r\nImperial Guard A: We came to investigate the landing of an unknown helicopter, and if it isn't the infamous investigation team.\r\nImperial Guard B: I'm sure you came hoping to rescue Ichikishimahime, but we aren't about to allow it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: The Search is On! (2)\r\n\r\nKofuki: Now that the party crashers are dealt with, let's follow Mihocchi's intuition all the way to Ichikishimahime!\r\nChie: But, couldn't it make things worse if we move around carelessly...?\r\nMirja: I checked with Origami Akane-sama just now. It sounds as though she's already taken that into consideration.\r\nMirja: However, the government is watching closely, so she has asked us to cause as little of a commotion as possible.\r\nMirja: ...As well as that, if we encounter any imperial guard during our search, we should expect to fight again. Please be prepared.\r\nMihono: Understood! We should get moving then!\r\nMirja: ...Yes, I agree.\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nKiyoka: (...Mirja-san noticed. That during that fight with the imperial guard, I still hesitated...)\r\nKiyoka: (No... I'm fine. I'll be fine. I made a promise. Where there's a will, there's a way...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Princess of Denial (1)\r\n\r\nYukari: Phew...\r\nIchikishima: So even you get tired.\r\nYukari: After the constant series of attacks from the imperial guard, anyone would.\r\nIchikishima: The imperial guard... All their attacks so far, to offer me to Tagitsuhime?\r\nIchikishima: What great lengths they go to...\r\nImperial Guard A: --There they are!! It's Origami Yukari and Ichikishimahime!\r\nImperial Guard B: Don't let them get away!\r\nYukari: Another wave then.\r\nIchikishima: Yukari, will you still fight?\r\nYukari: That goes without saying.\r\nYukari: As for you, are you still not going to draw Juzumaru?\r\nIchikishima: I told you before, did I not. A temporary victory is meaningless. I've grown tired.\r\nYukari: I see. Then keep quiet and stand there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Princess of Denial (2)\r\n\r\nIchikishima: ...Sigh.\r\nYukari: What are you sighing for now?\r\nIchikishima: Pity, for the imperial guard acting as tools for Tagitsuhime.\r\nIchikishima: After searching for one as worthless as myself, only to be beaten about by Yukari, I cannot help but pity them.\r\nYukari: ...At the very least, Tagitsuhime thinks you're worth enough to order her guard to capture you.\r\nYukari: Is there nothing you can do about that self-defeating attitude of yours?\r\nIchikishima: There is nothing to be done.\r\nIchikishima: In contrast to Tagitsuhime of vengeance and Takirihime of dominance, I am only Ichikishimahime of denial.\r\nYukari: That's the first I've heard of those titles...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: The Place We Should Go Is (1)\r\n\r\nKofuki: Come on, Mihocchi's intuition, show us the way to Yukari-sama and Ichikishimahime!\r\nMihono: My intuition can't handle the pressure... At least let me find a hint or something...\r\nMirja: I was just thinking, could we not get information from the imperial guard searching in the area?\r\nMirja: We can also discover how aware the imperial guard are of Ichikishimahime's movements, which would be two birds with one stone.\r\nChie: Mirja-san, that's a great idea.\r\nKofuki: But, how do we get the imperial guard to tell us anything? Are we gonna torture them?\r\nKiyoka: Don't suggest something so scary...\r\nChie: --!! Everyone, there's some imperial guard over that way. Let's hide for a moment and listen to what they're saying.\r\n\r\nImperial Guard A: --The ones who arrived before us still haven't managed to capture Ichikishimahime?\r\nImperial Guard B: It appears that the guards who went to secure her have all been defeated by Origami Yukari.\r\nImperial Guard C: That means, even having lost Tagitsuhime-sama's power, Origami Yukari is still going strong.\r\nImperial Guard C: In that case, where should we go?\r\nImperial Guard B: After Origami Yukari and Ichikishima landed on Choshi's beach, they seem to have continued heading north.\r\nKofuki: ...Get a load of these idiots. Just sharing important info where anybody can hear.\r\nKiyoka: Kofuki-san, don't badmouth them...\r\nKofuki: So since they knew where Yukari-sama's going, now all we have to do is beat 'em up and go north.\r\nKiyoka: Eh-!? We're going to fight them now!?\r\nKofuki: Duh, of course we are.\r\nMihono: Yeah, I agree with Fukki. Their goal is to catch Ichikishimahime, so sooner or later we're going to have to fight them anyway.\r\nMihono: And it'll be easier if we attack them now, before they can group up with the other guards.\r\nMirja: You two have the right idea.\r\nMihono: Okay then, everybody, let's go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: The Place We Should Go Is (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Phew... Thank goodness we defeated them safely.\r\nMirja: They said that Origami Yukari-sama was headed north from Choshi beach.\r\nMirja: Taking that into consideration, what do you say we move to Kashima north of Choshi, and begin searching our way south from there?\r\nKiyoka: I think that might work.\r\nMihono: Good thing they knew Yukari-sama's route. Thinking about it, there's no way following my intuition would get us anywhere...\r\nKofuki: But hey, once we get to Kashima, we might actually have to count on it for real to help us find Ichikishimahime.\r\nMihono: Uugh... I never should've brought it up in the first place...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: An Elite Guard of Only Three (1)\r\n\r\nYume: Here we gooo! The three of us are gonna save Yukari-sama-!\r\nMaki: Yume... Even if you forced your way out of the hospital, will you really be okay?\r\nSuzuka: The situation may be dire enough to need everything we can offer, but you have to be mindful of your condition.\r\nYume: I'll be fine! Besides, there's no way I could sit around at a time like this!\r\nYume: And anyway, is there really any point in me staying in the hospital? Yeah I cough sometimes, but I'm not sick, right?\r\nYume: The doctor's are all confused too, cause they don't know which way to treat me.\r\nMaki: You're not wrong... They can give you an IV when you have no appetite, and blood transfusions when you get anemic, but there's no treatment for the underlying problem.\r\nMaki: What's seems to be behind most of your suffering is that the soul of yours we got back from the netherworld still hasn't adapted to your body yet.\r\nYume: Hmm... So does it have something to do with the noro still in my body?\r\nMaki: I don't think there's any way it's not related.\r\nSuzuka: It's due to the aradama power you were given that you could be recovered from the netherworld, but it also brought you this hardship...\r\nSuzuka: Though, Maki-san and I can hardly speak as bystanders.\r\nSuzuka: The noro continues to remain within our bodies as well.\r\nMaki: That's right. There's still too many mysteries surrounding noro. Something could always go wrong with our bodies too.\r\nMaki: Of course, when we were injected with noro, we were prepared for that, but--\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nYume: Aha-! Onee-sans! An aradama showed up! That's a pretty unlucky aradama, running into us like that, huh!\r\nSuzuka: It certainly is. We hardly have the time, so let's dispose of it at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: An Elite Guard of Only Three (2)\r\n\r\nYume: It's been so long since I got to have fun fighting aradama with you two-!\r\nMaki: Seeing the way you fought just now, it's looking like we worried about you for nothing.\r\nSuzuka: I'll say. Though, if anything begins to feel wrong to you, tell us at once, understand?\r\nYume: I know what to do by now. You worry too much, Suzuka-onee-san.\r\nMaki: Good, then let's keep going.\r\nYume: Okaaay! Just you wait, Yukari-sama-!\r\nYume: (...It's okay. It doesn't hurt that bad. I can handle it. There's no way I was just going to sit tight in the hospital...!!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: Let's Talk (1)\r\n\r\nIchikishima: ...I have grown tired of running.\r\nIchikishima: I may as well submit myself and be absorbed into Tagitsuhime...\r\nYukari: If you have the leisure to make stupid suggestions, then you should be moving your feet.\r\nYukari: When you split off from Tagitsuhime, you had a desire you wanted accomplished, didn't you. Are you fine with dying leaving that undone?\r\nIchikishima: A desire...\r\nIchikishima: I desired to sublimate humanity to greater heights through fusion with aradama, at one point.\r\nIchikishima: But none would desire such lofty ideals...\r\nIchikishima: I had hoped to prove my existence was not unnecessary... But I am tired.\r\nYukari: Then you're giving up?\r\nIchikishima: None around me will forgive me.\r\nYukari: I see. Though that means nothing to me.\r\nYukari: Whether or not anyone forgives you, I made up my mind to protect you.\r\nYukari: Even if they all wanted otherwise, I would never give you to Tagitsuhime.\r\nIchikishima: Yukari...\r\nImperial Guard A: Everyone, target sighted! It's Origami Yukari and Ichikishimahime!!\r\nImperial Guard B: Circle around them, so they can't escape! Don't give them anywhere to run! Make sure we're the ones to bring her in!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: Let's Talk (2)\r\n\r\nYukari: All the imperial guard in our surroundings have been dealt with. We can get some rest at last.\r\nIchikishima: ...I cannot understand. Why won't you break?\r\nIchikishima: For these twenty years, we were with you. And yet, as we wore away at you, you endured it all.\r\nIchikishima: From where do you find it? That strength of yours?\r\nYukari: You want to know? Then I'll tell you.\r\nYukari: You won't be able to understand just by watching, so speak with me.\r\nIchikishima: Communicating intent through conversation...?\r\nYukari: As you've said, humanity is immature. Thinking we can understand each other without conversation is nonsense.\r\nYukari: From speaking with you... For example, I was surprised to find how unexpectedly talkative you are.\r\nYukari: I thought you would be the silent type... Frankly, I was puzzled at first.\r\nIchikishima: Mm...\r\nYukari: I'm not very good at it myself, but this is how humans come to understand each other.\r\nYukari: --Though, saying that, it can be a problem when someone comes to understand you too well.\r\nYukari: Only you could have traced me this far. --Yuzuki.\r\nYuzuki: ...Only because you're easy to figure out, Yukari.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: Justified Scrutiny\r\n\r\nYume: Come on, onee-sans! I'm gonna leave you behind with how slow you're going-! Yukari-sama might get mad if you keep her waiting-!\r\nMaki: ...Suzuka.\r\nSuzuka: I know. She's not yet in good shape.\r\nMaki: But who knows what she'd get up to if we forced her to rest.\r\nSuzuka: She's quite the troublemaker, isn't she.\r\nMaki: It actually feels better having her where I can see her. Especially at a time like this.\r\nSuzuka: Though it's true that her health is coming back to her. This is a good chance to see how well she's recovered.\r\nMaki: You have a point. But we have to make sure we don't lose sight of her.\r\nSuzuka: Naturally. What a handful she can be, honestly.

Dispose of it!\r\nYume: You can get to see my good side too, glasses onee-san! TAAA-!\r\nYume: Geez~, that one wasn't even worth it~!\r\nYume: Ah! Suzuka-onee-san, look, look. Chocolate really did come out of this aradama I got.\r\nSuzuka: Just as the report said, aradama are targeting chocolate... Or at the very least, they certainly are attracted to it.\r\nSuzuka: ...But just because it's Valentines season doesn't mean even the aradama would become captivated by chocolate.\r\nMirja: It's an odd case. Chocolate manufacturers, confectioneries, and department stores have all come under attack from aradama.\r\nMirja: We still don't understand why the aradama are seeking out chocolate in the first place.\r\nSuzuka: But in the meantime, the least we can do is to station toji by stores and factories dealing with chocolate.\u3000\r\nMirja: Yes, I believe you made the right decision by proposing this countermeasure.\r\nMirja: After all, something had to be done about the public's feeling of unease. The workers in the shop were very grateful too.\r\nSuzuka: It was only the reasonable thing to do. Investigating the cause is another part of our mission. For that, I'd like to depend upon your talent for observation and analysis.\r\nMirja: I'll do what I can to meet your expectations.\r\nYume: You two are thinking way too hard about it~. All we have to do is beat up the aradama.\r\nYume: They're all so weak anyway, so just leave it to me and we'll be finished before you know it.\r\nMirja: You have a point. What matters most is eliminating the aradama.\r\nSuzuka: Thanks to Yume, we've cleared out the aradama here for the time being. Why don't we head on back?\r\nYume: Hey hey, when we get back, I wanna have some cake. I can, can't I?\r\nSuzuka: If you must, but only just a little, alright?\r\nYume: Awesome-!\r\nMirja: (Konohana Suzuka shows quite the soft side toward Tsubakuro Yume, doesn't she.)\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Welcome. An advance order? In that case, please fill this out.\r\nSuzuka: Very good, we have your order for a chocolate cake.\r\nYume: So wait, why are we just working here normally again!?\r\nMirja: With such frequent appearances of aradama, we would waste too much time arriving otherwise.\r\nSuzuka: And serving customers is unexpectedly entertaining, isn't it?\r\nMirja: It's certainly a more worthwhile use of our time than idly waiting for aradama to appear.\r\nYume: Ehh, but we could just eat cakes while we wait. The ones they have here are pretty good.\r\nSuzuka: You were greeting customers earlier though, Yume.\r\nYume: I got bored of that. It's no fun.\r\nMirja: However, it's a good experience. As toji, we rarely have opportunities to participate in normal customer service work.\r\nSuzuka: Welcome... Oh, it's you.\r\nEllen: Hi! It's your customer and also helper, Kohagura Ellen!\r\nEllen: You know, I never thought I'd see an ojou-sama like Hanahana serving customers like this!\r\nMirja: If you had to say one way or the other, would you not consider yourself an ojou-sama as well?\r\nEllen: Mmmm, well, I'm nothing compared to someone like Maimai, right?\r\nEllen: I don't exactly have the essence of an ojou-sama.\r\nEllen: Now, Miss Shopkeeper, what do you recommend for me?\r\nSuzuka: Let me see... As it is the Valentines season, we have many chocolate products. However, these pear tarts do have quite the flavor.\r\nEllen: In that case, I'll take one of those~.\r\nYume: Ah, Suzuka-onee-san! I wanna eat one too!\r\nSuzuka: You just had that strawberry shortcake, didn't you? You'll spoil your dinner.\r\nYume: Bleh. Fine, I'll wait till tomorrow.\r\nSuzuka: Yes, that's fine then.\r\nMirja: (But not just soft, it seems. And Tsubakuro Yume doesn't always behave so spoiled either.)\r\nMirja: (It's true after all, there are some sides to relationships that can't be seen until you get close.)\r\nEllen: We get to do a different job than usual while still performing our duty as toji. It feels weird; sort of exciting, don't you think?\r\nEllen: So let's have as much fun with it as we can!\r\nMirja: Yes, I'm glad to have you helping us. Let's settle this matter, along with discovering the underlying cause behind the aradama's behavior.\r\nSuzuka: As there are four of us now, why not work in two man teams from here on out? It would be more efficient that way.\r\nMirja: I don't object to the idea.\r\nYume: I'm fine with whatever. But I'd be fine on my own too.\r\nEllen: Don't say that, Yumecchi. We never get a chance like this, so I want to pair up with you!\r\nYume: With you, Onee-san? Sure, that might be kind of fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Chocolate Panic Epilogue\r\n\r\nSuzuka: I won't allow any further disturbance from you--\r\nSuzuka: --HAAH-!!\r\nEllen: An impressive swing! Good job, Hanahana.\r\nSuzuka: It was nothing so remarkable. Now then, Yume, what was it this time?\r\nYume: Just more ribbons and boxes. Haven't most of them been like this lately?\r\nSuzuka: At the start, it seemed only chocolate would come from these aradama, but we've gathered a mountain of packaging supplies by now...\r\nMirja: Looking at it statistically, we should recognize that their goal was not chocolate itself, but materials to package chocolate.\r\nSuzuka: From the reports, it appears the factories of chocolate manufacturers have seen a steady reduction of damages.\r\nSuzuka: In their place, cases of department stores and sweets shops being attacked for their packaged chocolate gifts have risen... \r\nEllen: But I've heard that, thanks to all the toji working so hard, the phenomenon with these aradama is going back to normal!\r\nEllen: Is there any truth to that, Hanahana?\r\nSuzuka: I'm very curious as to hear where you heard that, but we will indeed be returning to normal alert status starting today.\r\nSuzuka: In fact, the rate of aradama appearances has dropped to the extent that the four of us could act simultaneously even in this large shopping mall.\r\nYume: Really? So that means, we won't get to wear those uniforms much longer. I'm a little disappointed.\r\nSuzuka: You did look very nice in it.\r\nYume: Oh yeah, so what was with the aradama stealing packaging supplies anyway?\r\nMirja: Unfortunately, we were never able to discern the reason behind that...\r\nEllen: ......\r\nEllen: What if, maybe the aradama also just wanted a gift of chocolates from someone?\r\nYume: Ehh, but they're aradama?\r\nEllen: Well like they say, a gift comes from the heart.\r\nEllen: Think about it, Yumecchi. It feels good to get a present, so, if you had the chance, you'd gladly take one, right?\r\nYume: Sure I guess...\r\nMirja: That's a somewhat poetic viewpoint, but I suppose even aradama can be charmed by certain things.\r\nSuzuka: We can speculate all we want, but there's no clear answer. The noro has been recovered, so let's return to the shop.\r\n\r\nYume: Thank you very much.\r\nMirja: As soon as we've become used to dealing with customers, the time has come to leave this store.\r\nSuzuka: I know. It gave us some trouble, but it was a rather fulfilling mission; offering a valuable experience working with customers.\r\nEllen: More than anything, I'm sad there wasn't one of those cute uniforms to wear in my size.\r\nEllen: By the way, you had one of the workers here help teach you how to make chocolate sweets, didn't you, Hanahana?\r\nEllen: Were you going to make a gift for somebody?\r\nSuzuka: ......\r\nSuzuka: I only saw it as an opportunity to learn from a professional... Well, it might be nice to try making someone a present.\r\nSuzuka: What about you; are you going to give someone chocolate?\r\nEllen: I'll give some to Kaoru, of course! The cakes here are delicious that I already made a reservation.\r\nYume: I got a lot of chocolate too, so I think I'll share some with Yomi-onee-san. Just a little though.\r\nMirja: Oh... A text message from someone? Please excuse me.\r\n\r\nFrom Yamashiro Yui: Hello, Mirja-san!\r\nIt's almost Valentines, you know. So why not give some chocolate to your cute kouhai who works so hard every day!\r\nSome chocolate, filled up with your love, for Valentines Day, if you please!\r\nIf you feed it to me while I say ahhh, I'll swear to you my eternal loyalty, no, love! So--\r\n\r\nMirja: Huh... At some point, Yamashiro Yui must have gotten my contact information...\r\nMirja: Well, regardless...

I never managed to give it to Kanami.\r\nHiyori: If only I'd said it was thanks for all the help she's given me... Then I could have casually handed it to her.\r\nHiyori: But now it's too late. I'll just eat those chocolates.\r\nHiyori: Hm? I know I left the box around here.\r\nHiyori: Wait... Was it my bag?\r\nHiyori: ...Where did it go?\r\nHiyori: What if... I dropped it somewhere!?\r\nHiyori: This isn't good... I left a message in it. I stayed up late worrying over what to write, and I get the feeling... I might have said too much...\r\nHiyori: No, I can't have written anything that serious... But, if anyone saw it...\r\n\r\nKaoru: Ooh. I never thought you'd write something like that.\r\nKaoru: No no, I think it's great. (grin)\r\n\r\nHiyori: Kh... I have to find it right now-!\r\n\r\nHiyori: It wasn't turned into the lost and found...\r\nKanami: Oh, Hiyori-chan! Did you hear? The chocolate...\r\nHiyori: !? ...K-Kanami.\r\nKanami: What's wrong? Why'd you jump like that?\r\nHiyori: N-No reason... More importantly, what was that about chocolate?\r\nKanami: Right, there's been a ton of cases of aradama stealing chocolate!\r\nHiyori: Huh?\r\nKanami: It's just like it sounds; aradama are stealing chocolate.\r\nKanami: Not too long ago they were going after factories and stores that had chocolate... I wonder why?\r\nHiyori: (Then the culprit... Was an aradama-!?)\r\nKanami: They took the chocolates Mai-chan gave to Sayaka-chan too.\r\nSayaka: Mm. I was eating them bit by bit. There were still a lot left.\r\nKanami: I ate all mine right away, so I don't have anything to worry about. But it must have been a shock when they vanished like that.\r\nSayaka: I should have eaten mine too. But I'll get Mai's chocolates back for sure.\r\nHiyori: Right, we have to get them back!\r\nKanami: You had yours taken too, Hiyori-chan? I'll help you out!\r\nHiyori: Th-Thank you. By the way, did anyone else lose theirs?\r\nKanami: Well, apparently Shidou-san got a ton of chocolates, but then the whole thing was stolen. I think she was the first person to report it happening.\r\nHiyori: Did she really get that much...?\r\nKanami: There's a lot of girls out there who are fans of Shidou-san.\r\nSayaka: ...A message came in about a mission.\r\nKanami: Looks like a response to the chocolate stealing aradama.\r\nHiyori: We should go, Kanami, Sayaka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Recover the Chocolate!\r\n\r\nMaki: Continuing since the other day, aradama targeting chocolate have appeared. This time it seems they aren't after packaging materials, but the chocolate itself.\r\nMaki: Due to the large stores of chocolate, they should have caused considerable damage in the area of this shopping mall.\r\nMaki: We're going to sweep through the aradama around here, and rescue that chocolate!\r\nKanami: What's with Shidou-san? She seems more motivated than usual, doesn't she?\r\nSayaka: ...Shidou Maki, do you like chocolate?\r\nMaki: Ah, I do, but more than that, chocolate from someone important to me went missing. So I might be a little worked up about getting it back.\r\nMaki: There's more for me to explain. From the reports of toji who have already been dealing with this issue, it's been confirmed that defeated aradama are in fact dropping chocolate.\r\nMaki: On this mission, in addition to suppressing aradama and gathering their chocolate...  You will be competing over the amount of chocolate you can recover, and the result will be reflected on your grades this term.\r\nMaki: Additionally, if you encounter any other toji on this mission, you will have a practice match with them. The winner of that match will also be reflected on your grades.\r\nMaki: On top of that, if you encounter another toji during the mission, go ahead and and face off against them. The outcome of your match will also be considered on your grades.\r\nMaki: The presidents of the Five Traditions have agreed on this matter. It may seem difficult, but I'd like for you to give your best efforts exterminating these aradama.\r\nKofuki: Graded on matches? Way to spoil the fun...\r\nKofuki: But I guess even if I half-ass it, I still get my fill of cutting up aradama-chan out there!\r\nKiyoka: So basically, the usual for you, Kofuki-san. If we're being graded on this, then I need to try a little harder too.\r\nKanami: Hey, I have a question! What do we do with the chocolate we recover?\r\nSuzuka: The chocolate taken by aradama is considered unfit for sale, so we will be disposing of it.\r\nSuzuka: However, if the person it belongs to can be determined from a name or message included with the chocolate, we will try to return it to them.\r\nHiyori: (They'll be reading messages...? Then I have to get to that chocolate before anyone else does.)\r\nKanami: Can we eat the chocolate that gets recovered?\r\nSayaka: I was wondering that too.\r\nMaki: According to the analysis provided by Ban Tsugumi, they should be safe to eat.\r\nMaki: It'd be a problem for me too if they were inedible. After you worked so hard, Suzuka...\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san. Don't you think it's about time we got the mission underway?\r\nMaki: Yeah, you're right. Then, begin clearing the area of aradama!\r\n\r\nMaki: HAAAHH-!!\r\nMaki: I've found some of the chocolates that were given to me, but... No sign of the ones Suzuka made.\r\nSuzuka: If only you had eaten them. You ate some of the chocolates the other girls gave you, didn't you?\r\nMaki: Sorry. It just somehow felt like a waste to eat yours.\r\nSuzuka: It wasn't something you needed to be so appreciative of.\r\nMaki: That's not true. What you gave me was special. It was handmade, after all.\r\nSuzuka: ...Honestly. There you go again. [muttered]\r\nSuzuka: If that's how you feel, then do your best to find it.\r\nMaki: Of course, I will.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: ...I did it! Ah, this one's all wrapped up.\r\nHiyori: Kiyoka. Sorry, but could you let me see that chocolate?\r\nKiyoka: Does this chocolate belong to you, Juujou-san?\r\nHiyori: ...Doesn't seem like it. Thanks.\r\nKiyoka: You already recovered a lot of chocolate, didn't you, Juujou-san?\r\nKanami: I know, right! I'm impressed, Hiyori-chan.\r\nHiyori: Yes, well, this is just part of our duty as toji.\r\nHiyori: (They still haven't found it... I shouldn't get impatient. So long as Kanami or our friends don't collect it, I should be able to work something out...)\r\nKanami: Okay, I'm going to try my hardest not to lose to you, Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: ......\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: There's Only One Chocolate I Want\r\n\r\nMai: We've gathered quite a lot of chocolate, haven't we.\r\nSuzuka: There are several highly motivated toji working to recover it, after all.\r\nMai: Like Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan, and Sayaka-chan?\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san as well. The amount those four have found is head and shoulders above the rest.\r\nSuzuka: Though, with everyone's hard work,  we collected more chocolate than we anticipated. It's unfortunate we had to ask to take up space in this store for the time being.\r\nSayaka: Mai, I brought chocolate.\r\nMai: Good work, Sayaka-chan. Why not take a little break?\r\nSayaka: But... I still haven't found Mai's chocolate.\r\nMai: You don't have to worry about that. I can always make more chocolate for you.\r\nMai: And anyway, even though they said it was okay, wouldn't it be best if you didn't eat chocolate that came out of an aradama?\r\nSayaka: It's something Mai made for me, so I want to get it back.\r\nMai: Thank you, Sayaka.\r\nSayaka: Why are you thanking me?\r\nMai: It's hard to say, but just hearing that made me happy, I guess?\r\n\r\nMaki: Sorry. I brought back a load of chocolate, but can you keep these separate from the rest?\r\nSuzuka: I'll look after them; it won't be a problem. Were these ones sent to you?\r\nMaki: Yeah, these ones were. It'd be a big help if you could.\r\nSuzuka: There's... Quite a lot of them, aren't there.\r\nMaki: I'm glad I managed to get them back, after they went through the trouble of gifting them to me.\r\nSuzuka: I'm sure.\r\nMaki: ...Anyway, I'm going back to suppressing aradama. If a large group of aradama comes up, send me a message.\r\nSuzuka: If she'd only ask, I'd gladly make more chocolate for her.\r\n\r\nHiyori: Even after all I've gathered, there's still no sign of that chocolate...\r\nKanami: Hey, Hiyori-chan! Just look at all the chocolate you found. How many aradama did you beat for it?\r\nHiyori: Honestly... I lost count.\r\nKanami: Ehehe, me too, actually. It's all good so long as we get a lot of chocolate back.\r\nKanami: See, look how much I got? If I had to buy this much, I'd be all out of spending money.\r\nHiyori: That is a lot. Mind if I look through it?\r\nKanami: Sure? But, why?\r\nHiyori: I'll owe you one. If this chocolate I'm looking for is in there, that is...\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan, would you like regular chocolate without the mint too?\r\nHiyori: It's not like I dislike it. It's a vital part of chocolate mint, after all.\r\nHiyori: (Good... Kanami doesn't seem to have found it. But still, I have to find it fast...)\r\nKanami: Then, I'll give you some chocolate I reccomend later. Mihono-chan showed it to me recently.\r\nHiyori: I'm looking forward to it. But for now, there's aradama to deal with.\r\nHiyori: (If I can't find that chocolate meant for Kanami...)\r\nSayaka: (If I can't find Mai's chocolate...)\r\nMaki: (If I can't find Suzuka's chocolate...)\r\nHiyori/Sayaka/Maki: (I'll just have to kill every last aradama!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: How Does the Chocolate Taste?\r\n\r\nKofuki: What the hell, I thought I'd sliced up the most aradama-chan, but four people got ranked higher than me...\r\nKiyoka: I think 5th place is still pretty amazing!\r\nKofuki: I guess, but that just means they stole that many aradama-chan from me...\r\nKiyoka: There's no way you can call that stealing though.\r\nKiyoka: More importantly, Kofuki-san? Did you eat the chocolate I gave you?\r\nKofuki: Yep. That stuff was pretty good. Thanks.\r\nKiyoka: Fufu. I'm glad to hear it then. It was worth it after all.\r\n\r\nSayaka: I like the chocolates you make too, Mai.\r\nMai: Ah, don't eat it all now, Sayaka-chan. Save some for later.\r\nSayaka: But, I don't want them to get stolen again.\r\nMai: It's okay. If that happens, I'll make you another batch.\r\nSayaka: Then, I feel better. Do you want to eat some, Mai?\r\nMai: Okay. I'll have one.\r\nSayaka: There's something I want to try... Say \"ahhh\".\r\nMai: ...!\r\nMai: A-Alright. Ahhhm...\r\nMai: ...Even though I made these, it tastes so strange...\r\nSayaka: Really? It tastes good to me. Do you want to eat another one?\r\nMai: ...That's okay! You can have the rest, Sayaka-chan.\r\nSayaka: Mm... I really like these.\r\n\r\nMaki: You did good work today, Suzuka.\r\nSuzuka: Not as much as you, Maki-san. You worked hard, running all about.\r\nMaki: I guess you're right. But with the support you gave me, I could focus everything on fighting.\r\nSuzuka: You had something you were searching for, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: And thanks to you, I found it. With the mission finished, I think I'll have them right now.\r\nSuzuka: (...I never expected to see her eating them in person. I did test the taste thoroughly, so there should be no issue...)\r\nMaki: Here they are.\r\nMaki: Mm! It's delicious... These are delicious, Suzuka.\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, I'm glad to hear it suits your tastes, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: Since you're an ojou-sama, I figured you wouldn't be used to it, but it turns out you're perfect when it comes to cooking too.\r\nSuzuka: P-Perfect? You're just flattering me.\r\nMaki: No, that's how I really feel. I'll have to come up with a good return gift for these.\r\nSuzuka: I'll very much look forward to it.\r\n\r\nHiyori: Kh...\r\nHiyori: (I never did find that chocolate... It would be hard to ask if there was any chocolate directed to Kanami, so there's nothing I can do...)\r\nHiyori: (What if it's still somewhere in my room? Ahh, that must be what happened!)\r\nKanami: Hmm, who's this chocolate from? Mai-chan gave it to me, since it has my name on it, but...\r\nHiyori: ! That's...\r\nHiyori: ...I'll just have to own up. Sorry, Kanami. Can I talk to you?\r\nKanami: What is it, Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: That chocolate... It's from me.\r\nHiyori: On Valentines Day... I was going to give it to you, but it was too awkward, so I never did...\r\nHiyori: I know it's a week late, but, will you accept it?\r\nKanami: Sure! Though, I'd rather have you actually give it to me. Here.\r\nHiyori: It feels sort of weird, giving back something that was just returned to me...\r\nHiyori: Take this, Kanami. Think of it as... Thanks, for everything you do for me.\r\nKanami: Thank you! Why don't we eat it together!\r\nKanami: Ah, I knew it, it's chocolate mint!\r\nKanami: Chew chew... Hey, this is actually pretty good?\r\nHiyori: So you've started appreciating chocolate mint? I knew you would come around.\r\nKanami: Oh, there's a little card tucked in here.\r\nHiyori: Wait... Don't read that!\r\nKanami: Sorry, I already did.\r\nKanami: \"I depend on you as much as you depend on me. You're always joining me in sparring sessions, after all.\"\r\nKanami: I feel the same way, and I'm glad we're friends!

If that's what our princess decided, that makes it right.\r\nKofuki: You're not even trying to talk sense.\r\nMihono: Hey, seriously, what happened to you two?\r\nHana: Nothing happened.

It's clearly different from what they gave to the elite guard, though. This is just brainwashing.\r\nYui: Shouldn't we get started already? If you go easy on us, you're going to die. So take this seriously. Okay, everyone?\r\nMihono: ...Isn't there any other way?\r\nKofuki: They're more than happy to fight. This is all we can do!\r\nMirja: This is my fault...

Those who hold great power, under the pretext of suppressing aradama. --The toji.\r\nTV (Tagitsu): They have ignored my requests for dialogue, attempting to destroy me the same as they would an aradama incapable of communication.\r\nTV (Tagitsu): I have done no more than fended off the sparks that have fallen on me.

However, wanting to avoid any further destruction, she has agreed to be taken into custody by the Sword Administration Bureau.\r\nTV (Yukina): Furthermore, without resorting to violence, Tagitsuhime has calmly sought to open a dialogue. Having witnessed this, there are those among the toji who have begun to revise their way of thinking.\r\nTV (Yukina): Dialogue is what enabled humans to establish civilized society. Could we not also establish a relationship of trust with an aradama seeking dialogue...? I have come to think this way as well.\r\nTV (Yukina): However, Origami Yukari does not agree. She ignored Tagitsuhime's pleas and continued her confinement.\r\nTV (Yukina): And then... Ichikishimahime came into being. Ichikishimahime is another version of Tagitsuhime, born from her misgivings towards humanity.\r\nTV (Yukina): Ichikishima, who had separated from Tagitsuhime, attempted to escape from Kamakura, resulting in a great amount of noro to be spread across the Kanto area.\r\nTV (Yukina): Even so, even amomgst the confusion, we would like to save Tagitsuhime, together with the imperial guard formed from Ayanokouji toji under President Souraku's supervision.\r\nMirja: --How can she say that-!?\r\nTV (Yukina): Ichikishimahime, who was prevented from escaping, is still under the control of the Administration Bureau.\r\nTV (Yukina): Ichikishimahime seeks revenge against humanity. Nothing more. If her power were ever unleashed, it could bring about an even greater disaster.\r\nTV (Yukina): Even when dealing with such a dangerous entity, Origami Yukari still refuses to relinquish her.\r\nTV (Yukina): Our only protection against such a tragedy is for Ichikishimahime to once more be fused into Tagitsuhime.\r\nTV (Yukina): To that end, we, the Sword Administration Bureau Reformation Faction, will establish a base of operations here in Tokyo!\r\nTV (Yukina): In addition, we have a demand to make. Origami Yukari, as well as the Sword Administration Bureau, deliver Ichikishimahime to us immediately!\r\nTV (Yukina): If you continue to put the people in danger, we will respond to you with force!!\r\nMihono: ...What's she talking about...!? Renpu's President Takatsu and Ayanokouji's President Souraku went and teamed up with Tagitsuhime...!?\r\nKofuki: There's really no other way around it. The Five Traditions just got split in two.\r\nMirja: ...Taking that into consideration, we may come into conflict with the imperial guard-- with Yamashiro Yui and Suzumoto Hana, again at some point...\r\nKiyoka: B-But... We're all toji, we shouldn't be fighting...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Yume's Condition (1)\r\n\r\nSuzuka: You were finally discharged from the hospital, only to immediately be hospitalized again. Yume, you shouldn't force yourself.\r\nMaki: Suzuka, don't be too hard on Yume. If she hadn't raced over there, who knows how much worse things could have been.\r\nYume: Exactly, Suzuka-onee-san. You could praise me a little-- Urgh! Cough cough, cough!!\r\nSuzuka: Yume-!? Are you alright!?\r\nYume: Pant... Pant... I-I'm fine... It's not that serious...\r\nYume: I'm the secret weapon, so I can be ready to fight soon...!!\r\nSuzuka: Yume...\r\nYume: Anyway, you saw Yomi-onee-san, didn't you? How'd it go?\r\nMaki: ...She's doing fine.\r\nYume: ...And? Is she really not...\r\nMaki: No, I'm sorry. It doesn't seem like she's being forced to help them.\r\nSuzuka: Yes. We can only assume that... Yomi-san is assisting Tagitsuhime of her own free will.\r\nYume: Really... So that makes Yomi-onee-san our enemy.\r\nYume: But hey, if we beat Tagitsuhime, then Yomi-onee-san will come back, and then the four of us can be the elite guard again, right!\r\nMaki: ...Mm, that's right.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Sigh... Another aradama suppression mission...?\r\nChie: With the rate at which aradama keep appearing, we hardly have time to rest...\r\nMihono: But, it's still okay, so long as it's aradama. If we ran into the imperial guard...\r\nMihono: Ah... S-Sorry, Mirja-san. I shouldn't have said that...\r\nMirja: There's no need to be concerned for my sake. Of course, that's also a reasonable likelihood.\r\nMihono: But...\r\nKofuki: Oh-! There's the aradama-chan! Show me another good time-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Yume's Condition (2)\r\n\r\nKofuki: That was fun as hell! I love you, aradama-chan!\r\nKiyoka: Kofuki-san's enjoying herself...\r\nChie: Here, let's start recovering the noro.\r\nMihono: --Huh?\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono, what is it?\r\nMihono: ...Mirja-san, are they...\r\nMirja: --You're...!\r\nImperial Guard: All of you, good work on your suppression mission. Now then, would you leave that noro to us?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Fighting Between Toji (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: Leave you the noro... But why? Is Tagitsuhime telling you to collect noro for her?\r\nChie: In which case, we aren't just going to let you take it.\r\nImperial Guard A: ...? I don't understand what you're getting at. What's the problem?\r\nImperial Guard B: Because of Tagitsuhime-sama's help, our capabilities as toji have rapidly improved.\r\nImperial Guard B: With the improvement of former second and third rate toji who were unable to contribute before, aradama extermination can be optimized, and the public's risk of harm is lowered.\r\nImperial Guard B: Which means, so long as we follow Tagitsuhime-sama's guidance, our world will become an even safer, even better place to live!\r\nMirja: ...Do you honestly believe what Tagitsuhime tells you?\r\nKiyoka: Exactly... Isn't it weird to think that Tagitsuhime would want to coexist with humanity...?\r\nImperial Guard A: What are you saying! Tagitsuhime-sama would never tell a lie!\r\nKofuki: They're a lost cause. They've been totally brainwashed.\r\nMihono: I'm sorry, but we won't let you have this noro! We're not going to let Tagitsuhime do whatever she wants!\r\nImperial Guard A: They can't understand Tagitsuhime-sama's magnificence...\r\nImperial Guard B: If you insist on opposing the will of Tagitsuhime-sama, then, as her loyal soldiers, we of the imperial guard will enforce it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Fighting Between Toji (2)\r\n\r\nImperial Guard A: Kh... They're tough...!! Tagitsuhime-sama... I'm so sorry...!!\r\nImperial Guard B: We don't have a choice. We'll cut our losses and retreat.\r\nMirja: Stop right there! Before you go, tell me the current state of Yamashiro Yui and Suzumoto Hana!\r\nImperial Guard A: ...Yamashiro-san and Suzumoto-san lead a platoon of imperial guards, serving Tagitsuhime-sama.\r\nImperial Guard B: Those two have high compatibility with noro, after all... If only our compatibility were greater, we wouldn't have lost to the likes of you...!!\r\nKiyoka: They're gone...\r\nChie: Would it have been better if we restrained them?\r\nMirja: We shouldn't carelessly provoke the enemy right now. More importantly, it's possible they called for reinforcements. We should collect the noro as quickly as we can and leave this place.\r\nMihono: ...Things have really ended up where toji are fighting each other...\r\nKofuki: Cheer up, Mihocchi. They got pumped full of noro, right? That makes them practically half aradama-chan anyway.\r\nKiyoka: Kofuki-san! Don't put it like that!\r\nKofuki: What, you wanna play nice with them? It's just the truth. We can't even talk to them.\r\nMihono: (.........What are we supposed to do. We're all still toji, but... What should...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Where the Noro Goes (1)\r\n\r\nChie: Phew... We're back at last. We had another difficult day, with one mission after another...\r\nChie: By the way, Mirja-san? What are Ayanokouji's toji going to do now? Will they really go back to Ayanokouji?\r\nMirja: Though they may be from Ayanokouji, they won't all do as the President wishes. There are toji who won't go back.\r\nKiyoka: You're going to stay here in Renpu, aren't you, Mirja-san?\r\nMirja: I plan on it. There are still things I need to take care of here.\r\nAcademy Intercom: Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--\r\nMihono: Aradama again!? We only just got back!\r\nKofuki: But that's good news! Let's get over there already!\r\n\r\nKofuki: Okay, now where are the aradama-chan hiding-?\r\nKiyoka: --Hang on. Something's not right about this.\r\nChie: There's imperial guards here...!? And...!\r\nYui: Ah-! You're all here-! What's all this about? Did you come just to see me?\r\nHana: Of course they didn't. The investigation team is here to defeat the aradama we just took care of.\r\nMihono: Yui and Hana!?\r\nHana: You're too slow though. The aradama was successfully suppressed, and we've finished collecting its noro.\r\nMirja: And when you bring that noro back, what do you plan on doing with it?\r\nMirja: Your home base should only be a hotel in Tokyo. You have no means of storing it, correct? It's hard to imagine you have the means of enshrining it either...\r\nYui: That's my Mirja-san! Sup~er smart!\r\nHana: You already have an idea, don't you?\r\nMirja: Tagitsuhime is absorbing it all...\r\nYui: That's my Mirja-san! Sup~er smart, part 2!\r\nYui: If Tagitsuhime-sama sucks in a whole bunch of noro, she'll get even stronger, and even closer to a perfect body!\r\nMirja: Is that so... In that case, we cannot allow you to continue like this. Please give us the noro you have collected.\r\nHana: I'm afraid that's out of the question.\r\nMirja: If you refuse, then we will take it by force...\r\nYui: What's that? You're going to fool around with us, Mirja-san?\r\nYui: Then I'll give you a good~ look at just how strong we've gotten!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: Where the Noro Goes (2)\r\n\r\nYui: Pant... Pant... The investigation team's just as strong as I remember.\r\nYui: But, too bad. There's a special bonus waiting for us if we bring back noro. So there's no way we're letting you have it, Mirja-san.\r\nKofuki: What the hell-! We beat you fair and square!\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki, control yourself. We no longer have the strength to use utsushi. To pursue this any further would be dangerous.\r\nChie: Our enemy is Tagitsuhime, not the imperial guard. I don't like it either, but we should let them take the noro.\r\nMihono: --Yui! Hana! Are you two really helping Tagitsuhime now!?\r\nHana: I told you last time, Mihono. Tagitsuhime-sama is a goddess descended to earth. I would give everything for her.\r\nKiyoka: And there's no way we could... Get you to change your mind?\r\nHana: None at all.\r\nYui: Awww, today was disappointing. But next time for sure, I'll bring you all home with me, okay! So, until then, bye bye-!\r\nKiyoka: ...They're gone.\r\nKofuki: They seriously think Tagitsuhime is some kind of goddess. That's the kind of delusion a good whack on the head won't snap them out of.\r\nMihono: ...Then, we'll beat Tagitsuhime, and snap Yui and Hana out of it.\r\nKofuki: Ooh. Mihocchi, you're feeling pretty positive.\r\nMihono: .........Yeah. I'm not gonna back down from fighting the imperial guard anymore!\r\nMihono: I won't hesitate either! I'm going to stop Tagitsuhime for sure, and save Yui and Hana!\r\nMihono: Right, Mirja-san?\r\nMirja: Yes, absolutely. ...Yamashiro Yui, Suzumoto Hana. I swear, we will free you...!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKaoru's Consideration\r\n\r\nKaoru: Oi, Kanami. Did you hear? About the investigation team.\r\nKanami: ...Yeah. You mean about Yui-chan and Hana-chan, right?\r\nKaoru: Right. Hana was a member of Mokusa who was sent to infiltrate Ayanokouji. She really worked her way in.\r\nKanami: Infiltrate... Like, as a spy?\r\nKaoru: Just like that. Which means, even in Mokusa, she got great results, and was highly loyal.\r\nKaoru: Only an idiot would let a useless person who seems like they'll sell you out be a spy, anyway.\r\nKanami: And she still ended up in the imperial guard...\r\nKaoru: I don't know exactly why, but someone like that still ended up in the imperial guard. Which is why, Kanami.\r\nKaoru: Stop beating yourself up over what happened with Uchizato Ayumu. You didn't do anything wrong.\r\nNene: Ne-, ne-!\r\nKanami: ......Okay. Thanks, Kaoru-chan, Nene-chan."}, {"paste_key": "Xs7XKRw7", "title": "3-3 Takirihime", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/Xs7XKRw7", "timestamp": "", "hits": "142", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr_VwOqpOwA\r\n\r\n1: Tensions Rise\r\n\r\nYukina: They've each been adjusted thoroughly. These are now your loyal soldiers, Princess. Please use them as you see fit.\r\nTagitsuhime: ......\r\nYukina: On that note, President Souraku. Not all the pawns set to be her soldiers are here, because you let one slip out from under your nose. How disgraceful.\r\nYukina: If only you had restrained them sooner. This only happened thanks to all the time you wasted.\r\nYuzuki: ............\r\nYukina: And you too, Yomi. Just how useless are you going to be?\r\nYomi: ............\r\nYukina: Hmph! Well, it hardly matters. A rat running loose won't do anything to upset our superiority.\r\nYuzuki: Yukina...\r\nYomi: Steady yourself, President Souraku. It's too late to stop now.\r\nYuzuki: ...You're right. Yes, I can't stop this. In which case...\r\n\r\nSana: An imperial guard formed to protect Tagitsuhime. And \"Myouga toji\", strengthened with noro...\r\nSana: It looks like a confrontation with both President Takatsu and Souraku is inevitable at this point.\r\nMihono: Why are people fighting against each other...?\r\nMirja: I couldn't help but notice, I don't see Yamashiro Yui or Suzumoto Hana anywhere. Where are they?\r\nChie: ...You're the only one who's come back.\r\nMirja: I was... The only one?\r\nKiyoka: Ah, but you know, they could still be on their way here right now.\r\nMihono: Yeah, that's right! Or maybe they found a place to hide somewhere!\r\nKofuki: Those two aren't gonna get taken down so easy. How many rough spots do you think we've gotten out of so far?\r\nMirja: Yes, that's true...\r\nSana: That imperial guard of theirs is going to give us trouble in a fight. Powered up on noro, they'd be too much for our toji stationed at the Ministry of Defense.\r\nSana: We have to avoid the worst case scenario at all costs. I'm sending you four to help protect Takirihime as soon as possible. Kitora, you go back to the infirmary and rest.\r\nMirja: I'm joining them as well.\r\nSana: I admit, your injuries weren't as bad as they looked, but still...\r\nMirja: I am fine. There's no reason to keep me here.\r\nSana: Listen...\r\nKofuki: If Mirja said she's good to go, then that's all there is to it.\r\nMihono: Mmhm, I was shocked before, but Mirja-san wouldn't say she'd do something she couldn't. Of course I'm still worried, but I know she'll be fine.\r\nSana: Are you serious about this?\r\nChie: We've been fighting together for long enough. If Mirja-san says she can handle this, I'll trust her.\r\nKiyoka: Me too.\r\nSana: And now you're all ganging up on me... Sigh~~... Have it your way. I'll approve of you going with them. But make sure you don't overdo it, okay?\r\nMirja: ...Thank you, all of you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: An Audience with a Goddess (1)\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in the Ministry of Defense's Ichigaya garrison--\r\n\r\nAkane: I must ask you once more. Will you lend us your strength, Takirihime?\r\nAkane: If you agree to join forces with us against Tagitsuhime, that would bring us one step closer to your wish of humans and aradama coexisting.\r\nTakirihime: Insolence.\r\nTakirihime: What I demand from you humans is your servitude, not to fight as your equal.\r\nTakirihime: Submit Ichikishimahime to me. Do so, and I will allow you to live under my protection.\r\nAkane: Please wait. Is that what you meant by \"coexisting\"?\r\nTakirihime: Naturally. The immature species known as humans are no different from insects and beasts. I shall guide them on a better path, toward true coexistence.\r\nHiyori: ...That's enough, Akane-sama.\r\nHiyori: There's no doubt about it now. This is just another aradama, like Tagitsuhime. There's no chance of us coexisting.\r\nKanami: ............\r\nKanami: ...Um, Takirihime-san? Will you have a sword fight with me?\r\nHiyori: Wha...! Kanami! This isn't the time for...\r\nTakirihime: Oh...? What are your intentions, Chidori?\r\nKanami: This whole time, you haven't even looked at us once. That's why we aren't able to make any progress together.\r\nKanami: That's why... Um... I just thought that, if we get a good look at each other, humans and aradama would be able to understand each other better, is all...\r\nHiyori: And you think meeting face to face with your okatana is the simplest way to do that?\r\nKanami: Yeah...\r\nTakirihime: Hmph. A ridiculous proposal. Enough... Leave.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, near the Ichigaya garrison--\r\n\r\nChie: We're almost to the Ministry of Defense.\r\nKiyoka: You're sweating so much, Mirja-san... Are you really okay?\r\nMirja: It's not a problem. The painkillers have worn off is all.\r\nKofuki: You know, you're the one who's always saying to keep it in check. Just look at yourself.\r\nMirja: There is not going to be a problem. If anything, now that they've worn off, the pain will keep me alert.\r\nKofuki: How stubborn can you be!?\r\nAradama: GYAAAAUUU!\r\nMihono: Aradama!? And this many of them too...\r\nChie: It would be hard getting around them all. We'll have to fight our way through.\r\nKofuki: Just have to blitz 'em down!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: An Audience with a Goddess (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Why does this have to happen when we're in a hurry...\r\nMirja: I imagine that's why they're here, to slow us down by creating a disturbance.\r\nKofuki: Which means... Takirihime's in trouble, isn't she?\r\nKiyoka: All the more reason for us to hurry!\r\nMihono: Just hold on until I get there, Kanami!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Takirihime and Nene (1)\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes after Origami Akane's audience with Takirihime--\r\n\r\nTakirihime: A good look... To understand...............?\r\nTakirihime: ...You may show yourself.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nTakirihime: Aradama... No, what was once an aradama, but lost its necessary impurity. An aradama, yet not. What are you?\r\nNene: Ne...? Ne! Nene-!\r\nTakirihime: What do you want with my chest?\r\nNene: Ne-ne-...\r\nTakirihime: While you may not be impure, why do humans leave you be?\r\nNene: Ne?\r\nTakirihime: You too were birthed from the same human ignorance and foolishness. Yet, why do you lack that impurity?\r\nTakirihime: Let me glance through your memories.\r\nNene: Nene-!\r\n\r\nLong ago, 400 years prior. In the Mashiko's village--\r\n\r\nNene: GUOOOOOOOO--!\r\nMashiko Toji: You've really gone and wrecked the place.\r\nTakirihime: (A toji of this time...)\r\nMashiko Toji: Don't go causing all this trouble on Mashiko territory, you damn aradama! TORYAAAAAA!\r\nNene: GUOOOUU--!\r\nMashiko Toji: Aradama always make things difficult. If you want to go on a rampage, I'll be your opponent.\r\nMashiko Toji: ...So let's go again sometime!\r\nNene: Ne...?\r\nTakirihime: (This person... These people, they erased it?)\r\nTakirihime: (The impurity within you... After such a great span of time...)\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nTakirihime: The impurity of noro... It should be impossible to cleanse. But humans managed to do so.\r\nTakirihime: As a species, they are imperfect, with such short lives. But through such a simple method, through living alongside them for so long...\r\nTakirihime: Is such a thing possible? Such a miraculous outcome...\r\nNene: Ne?\r\nTakirihime: \"If we get a good look at each other, humans and aradama would be able to understand each other better\"...?\r\n\r\nMai: Yes... Yes... Understood!\r\nEllen: Maimai, was that Sana-sensei on the phone?\r\nHiyori: What happened?\r\nMai: A large number of aradama have appeared around Ichigaya, and are indiscriminately attacking civilians!\r\nKaoru: Seriously!? What're we going to do?\r\nHiyori: What else, we can't just ignore them!\r\nSayaka: But, our mission is to...\r\nHiyori: Protect Takirihime, I know. But...\r\nMaki: Don't get flustered.\r\nSuzuka: That's right. This is nothing more than an obvious diversion.\r\nEllen: Still...!\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san and I will go deal with these aradama.\r\nMaki: An old friend of ours should be coming.\r\nKaoru: .........It's annoying, but the elite guard is better than nothing I guess.\r\nEllen: It's reassuring having them on our side!\r\nMai: But, if the aradama attack is a diversion, then their true target is... Everyone, get the S equipment ready! As soon as possible!\r\nHiyori: Where did Kanami run off to, now that things are getting serious...\r\n\r\nJust then, inside the Ministry of Defense Facility--\r\n\r\nNene: Ne-, nene-!\r\nKanami: Nene-chan, where are you going? Oh, this is...\r\nKanami: !?\r\nTakirihime: ...Will you not draw?\r\nKanami: .........?\r\nTakirihime: Did you not say you wanted to fight with me?\r\nKanami: ...Okay! Then, I won't hold back!\r\nKanami: Haaah, hya-!\r\nTakirihime: .........\r\nKanami: Kh...! Hup, hya!!\r\n\r\nKanami: Th-Thank you very much! I feel like I can really see you now!\r\nTakirihime: ...I have been here from the beginning.\r\nKanami: I-I don't mean it like that! Uhh, it's like... I get the feeling you're like a giant ocean, or something...\r\nTakirihime: ...Ocean?\r\nKanami: It's big and vast and seems like it could accept anything... You know, like humans and aradama... Ahaha, I can't really explain it right, though.\r\nTakirihime: ............Hm.\r\nNene: Nene!\r\nKanami: S-So...! How did you see my sword... How do you see me?\r\nTakirihime: Chidori girl. I see, you are...\r\n\r\nAt the same time, on the grounds of the Ministry of Defense--\r\n\r\nAradama: GYAAAUUUU!\r\nKaoru: These damn aradama, they're showing up here now too!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Takirihime and Nene (2)\r\n\r\nKaoru: Phew~, is it over?\r\nKanami: Everyone-!\r\nHiyori: You're late, Kanami!\r\nKanami: Sorry! But, what's... Eh!? What's that sound?\r\nKanami: A helicopter? But, for some reason... Something's off...\r\nEllen: Something's dropping down.\r\nSayaka: People...?\r\nMai: So, this is their real attack...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Myouga Toji (1)\r\n\r\nKaoru: What the hell, what is it this time...!?\r\nMai: These are Ayanokouji toji!? Then, Tagitsuhime's behind this after all?\r\nAyumu: Ah, Etou-san! It's the real Etou-san!\r\nKanami: Huh-!? A-Ayumu-chan!?\r\nKanami: Why are... Why are you doing this, Ayumu-chan...!?\r\nHiyori: Are you all aware of what you're doing?\r\nEllen: It's no use, Hiyoyon! These girls won't listen to a word we say!\r\nAyumu: I've gotten stronger, Etou-san! See, like this!\r\nKanami: Where did, this strength come from? Even with Storm Armor...\r\nAyumu: Please watch this. I can do that move you showed me now, Etou-san!\r\nKanami: Gh...! Ayumu-chan... Hey, why are you...?\r\nAyumu: So keep looking! I can show you more and more, Etou-san!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Myouga Toji (2)\r\n\r\nHiyori: What's wrong with them!?\r\nEllen: President Souraku's gone and done the unthinkable too.\r\nSayaka: There's something I don't like about this...\r\nMai: Everyone, do something to push them back! Just beyond here is...!\r\nKaoru: I know, but... Come on!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, under the great torii gate on the grounds of the Ministry of Defense--\r\n\r\nToji A: KYAAAA!\r\nToji B: Wh... Who are you... She's too much... Ugh...\r\nTagitsuhime: ......I've kept you waiting, Takirihime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: The Nightmare Resumes (1)\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Roughly 2 kilometers away from the Ministry of Defense--\r\n\r\nMihono: Hyaa!\r\nAradama: GYAAAuuuu!\r\nMihono: Pant, pant... Was that the last one?\r\nKiyoka: I'm worn out... I think I might be too tired by the time we get to the Ministry of Defense.\r\nChie: With all these obstacles getting in our way, I'm beginning to think we might not even make it there in time.\r\nMirja: With their persistence... They must strongly want for us not to reach the Ministry of Defense.\r\nKofuki: It's starting to get on my nerves. Just let us through already!\r\nMihono: Huh? Fukki, I thought you'd be happy, getting to fight all these aradama.\r\nKofuki: Tagitsuhime might be waiting on the other side. Doesn't that sound way more exciting than fighting these nobodies!\r\nMihono: Ahh, that explains it. You never change, Fukki.\r\nKiyoka: But, without Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, I thought we couldn't defeat Tagitsuhime?\r\nKofuki: If we beat on her enough, she'll go running home. That's enough for now, right?\r\nMirja: True, with our objective being to guard, if Tagitsuhime were to retreat, the mission could then be considered a success.\r\nKofuki: See? I've been thinking this through.\r\nMihono: Fukki actually used her head!?\r\nKiyoka: She just wants to play with Tagitsuhime though...\r\nKofuki: Oiii. You two, meet me behind the gym later.\r\nChie: Ah-!! Everyone, look over there...! In the direction of the Ministry of Defense...\r\nMirja: There's a fire... It seems it's already begun.\r\nMihono: We have to do something! There's no time to waste!\r\nKofuki: Before that, looks like some other group came to get us.\r\nImperial Guard: We won't let you past here.\r\nKofuki: Huh? What's your deal?\r\nKiyoka: They're Ayanokouji toji?\r\nMirja: Is this... The imperial guard? Please wait, all of you are--\r\nImperial Guard: We have no time to waste talking. All members, deal with them!\r\nMirja: ...It pains me, but it seems we have no choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: The Nightmare Resumes (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Pant, pant... For them to be this tough... This is the power of noro...\r\nMirja: I would like for us to stop and recover here, but given the situation, we can't afford to. Let's head to the Ministry of Defense without delay.\r\n???: Ehh~? We came all this way to see you, so don't go saying something mean like you're gonna leave us here~.\r\n???: Though of course, we aren't about to let you go anyway.\r\nMirja: No... You're... Yamashiro Yui... Suzumoto Hana...\r\nYui: After all, this is my big chance to show off what I can do!\r\nHana: That's how it is. Everyone, prepare yourselves.\r\nMirja: Kh... Why... Why...?\r\nMihono: Ahh, you finally made it! You're late, you two! But, thank goodness... You made it back okay! You had us worried!\r\nKofuki: Stop, Mihocchi! Don't go near them!\r\nMihono: What do you mean, Fukki? And why'd you pull your okatana out?\r\nKofuki: Come on, don't give me that! Don't you get what happened!?\r\nKiyoka: Then... This... This can't be happening...\r\nChie: ...I don't want to believe it, but this is the reality we have to face. President Souraku... This is too cruel.\r\nMihono: Eh... Guys, what are you saying? I-It's Yui and Hana! They came back!\r\nKofuki: They aren't our friends anymore. No friend of ours would come looking ready to fight like that! Mihocchi, get it through your head already!\r\nMihono: You're wrong!!\r\nMihono: Come on, you two... Stop kidding around already, okay? Please... Just stop it!!\r\nYui: Don't go looking so sad. You'll spoil that cute face of yours, you know? Like this~, smile, smile~!\r\nHana: I can't think of anyone better to test this newfound strength of ours on. Luck is on our side.\r\nMihono: Yui...? Hana...?\r\nMirja: Gh... If I knew this would happen... I would have... I should have...!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: And Yomi...?\r\n\r\nSuzuka: President Takatsu... So she's taken that side after all.\r\nMaki: Right...\r\nMaki: ......\r\nSuzuka: Are you wondering about Yomi-san?\r\nMaki: If that's what President Takatsu chose to do, then Yomi must be following her orders.\r\nSuzuka: It seems that way... If the situation arises, we need to be ready to fight her.\r\nMaki: Maybe a good thing Yume's still recovering. Even against Yomi, I doubt she'd hold anything back.\r\nSuzuka: I wouldn't be so sure about that. Even Yume has things she's mindful of.\r\nMaki: ...I hope you're right."}, {"paste_key": "1p6YnVqZ", "title": "A Giant Yeti Encounter in a Snowy Mountain Forest!", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/1p6YnVqZ", "timestamp": "", "hits": "104", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/ngwn7UUtU4A\r\n\r\n1: The Smell of Trouble on a Snowy Mountain Mission...\r\n\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki, what are you waiting for! That aradama is escaping; get after it at once!\r\nKofuki: I know already! I'm trying, but... I can't get anywhere with my feet getting stuck in this goddamn snow.\r\nTsugumi: Aradama are capable of the same quick movements on both snow and even terrain. I see, this will be useful data.\r\nMirja: Ban Tsugumi, record data later! And Asakura Mihono, Setouchi Chie! What's the matter? You're reacting too slowly!\r\nMihono: Sorry, I can't move so great, with how cold it is here...\r\nChie: The same goes for me... You seem fine though, Kitora-san. Why is that?\r\nMirja: With the Scandanavian blood in my veins, cold of this degree is nothing unusual.\r\nMirja: Musumi Kiyoka! There's an aradama directly ahead of you!\r\nKiyoka: Okay! Gh... Sorry. My hands are too numb for me to get a good grip...\r\nMirja: In that case, Shichinosato Kofuki! ...Doesn't seem to be up to the task either.\r\nKofuki: Fuck! If it weren't for all this snow, I'd get to enjoy myself with all these aradama-chan!\r\nTsugumi: An empty stomach and lack of calcium must be making you grumpy. I have something sweet for you after we're done here, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: I'm not eating anything until you tell me what you put in it!\r\nTsugumi: Fufu, that's a secret though. I'm sure the rest of you are like me and feel your body temperature and morale quickly dropping. In which case, this is the perfect chance to test these emergency rations...\r\nTsugumi: Though, I take that back. It seems one of you is doing fine...\r\nYui: Kiyoka-chan, if you're cold, then I'll warm you right up! Here, hop into my arms!\r\nKiyoka: I'm cold, but... I'll take care of myself...\r\nYui: Ehh, don't be shy! Come on! Kiyoka-chan!\r\nMirja: At any rate, it seems the only ones among us able to move normally are myself and Yamashiro Yui. Yamashiro Yui, we'll have to manage this together.\r\nYui: Okaaay! Ah, I'll try super hard on this mission, so when we're done, can we all stop by the hot spring!?\r\nMirja: If I were to hypothetically agree to that, how much would \"super hard\" be?\r\nYui: I'll go at it 5 times harder than I usually do!\r\nMirja: ...In that case, I'll consider it.\r\nYui: Hooray-! If I get to see everyone bathing in the open under the snow, I'll try super duper hard!\r\nYui: DORYAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nTsugumi: All those aradama, taken out in seconds by one person... If only I could research some mechanism to reliably convert those dark thoughts to fighting energy.\r\nMirja: Our mission is complete. Then, before you're all frozen in place, let's head down the mountain. Please follow after me.\r\n\r\nMihono: Ughhh, the snow turned into a blizzard.\r\nChie: I can't see in front of us thanks to it... Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan, take my hands so we don't lose each other.\r\nKiyoka: Thank you. But what should we do? We're stuck here with all this snow...\r\nMirja: Please remain calm. I will guide you all out of here, so do your best not to fall behind.\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san, are you feeling okay? Mirja-san has already moved quite far ahead.\r\nKofuki: She'll be fine on her own. I could do that too, if it weren't snowing... Shit...\r\nTsugumi: You're awfully cranky today... At times like this, what would be best to cheer you up...\r\nYui: Kofuki-san, the cold is annoying you, right? Then don't worry; at the bottom of the mountain is a hot spring we can get all heated up in together!\r\nKofuki: I don't wanna!\r\nYui: Ehh, why not? A hot spring'll get your heart and body feeling all warm and fluffy! It'll pull you out of that bad mood in a second~.\r\nTsugumi: You're wrong, Yamashiro-san. What Shichinosato-san is sulking about is that she didn't get to play enough.\r\nKofuki: \"Didn't get to play enough\", what am I, a little kid!?\r\nMihono: AH-!\r\nChie: What is it, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: J-Just now...\r\nMirja: That was you shouting, wasn't it, Asakura Mihono? What happened?\r\nMihono: Just now, I saw a yeti over there in the woods!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Form Up! Yeti Investigation Team\r\n\r\nTsugumi: A yeti...? Over there in the woods you said, Asakura-san...\r\nKofuki: As if there's something like that out here! You suck at making jokes, Mihocchi.\r\nMirja: I have to agree. Creatures like yeti don't actually exist.\r\nMihono: But I know I saw it for sure!\r\nKiyoka: If it really is out there, that's scary... What if it tries to eat us...\r\nChie: Don't be afraid, Kiyoka-chan. If something like that happens, I'll protect you. And you never know, it could be a friendly yeti who's come to help us.\r\nYui: A friendly yeti? I hope it's a yuki onna instead then. They're meant to be hot.\r\nTsugumi: It must have been a fair distance away, so I doubt she was able to tell its sex. The weather has improved, so why don't we go looking for this yeti?\r\nKofuki: Count me out. I'm not walking around through all this snow looking for something that's not even an aradama-chan.\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san, we have to capture this yeti. If it turns out to be some new kind of aradama that doesn't register on our spectrum finders... That could be a very useful sample.\r\nKofuki: A new kind of aradama-chan!? You shouldn't said that sooner! We've got plenty of time before the train back comes, right? Let's go hunting!\r\nKiyoka: Suddenly Kofuki-san's more excited than anyone...\r\nMirja: It's true that's a possibility. The blizzard has ended and it's become warmer, so why don't we search the area?\r\nMihono: I'm all for it!\r\n\r\nKofuki: Come on, come on, outta the way-! I'm gonna be the first one to meet this new aradama-chan! You guys just try to keep up!\r\nMirja: She's very determined, that Shichinosato Kofuki. Now then, Asakura Mihono? Can you name any identifying features of the yeti you saw?\r\nMihono: Umm... It was really big, like I think it was over two meters tall. And it had all this messy white fur...\r\nTsugumi: Two meters tall... By the way, this messy fur it had, could you be more specific about it?\r\nMihono: Uhh... I know its head was all covered in fur, like PSHAAA, waving around all over...\r\nMihono: Oh yeah, oh yeah! Its eyes were seriously glowing too! It was like someone glaring, but way too intense for a person! It was so scary...\r\nTsugumi: (...I see, so that's what happened. Well, I won't spoil their fun.)\r\nTsugumi: (Besides, if worst comes to worst, I have these emergency rations. We should be able to avoid disaster...)\r\nMirja: The yeti... In some countries, it's also known as \"bigfoot\". It's defined as... Living deep in the mountains, far from human civilization, its body covered in thick fur, bipedal and stands upright...\r\nMirja: It's true that this unidentified animal you saw matches the definition on several points.\r\nKofuki: Was it really over this way, Mihocchi?\r\nMihono: Yeah. I saw it deep in the woods, so it should be over there.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Is it me, or is the sky getting darker?\r\nChie: It is. They say the weather up on mountains is fickle, but... Oh no, the snow's coming down again.\r\nMihono: We've been walking pretty far. Will we be able to find our way back?\r\nYui: I've got that covered! I left pebbles marking the way we came so we couldn't get lost, see... Wait, huh?\r\nTsugumi: Now we can't see them due to the blizzard.\r\nMirja: This is a problem. Now we have no way of knowing the way back, do we?\r\nKiyoka: Then, does that mean...\r\nMihono: We're stranded up here!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Stranded?\r\n\r\nTsugumi: The blizzard's grown even stronger than before, hasn't it? At this rate we might actually be stranded up here.\r\nKiyoka: What's going to happen to us...\r\nMihono: This is my fault. It's all because I said something I shouldn't have.\r\nKofuki: No point in crying about it. Besides, I was the one who wanted to go hunting for that aradama-chan.\r\nTsugumi: I'm also to blame. I shouldn't have provoked Shichinosato-san. I'm sorry...\r\nTsugumi: Kitora-san, how do they resolve situations like this when they happen in Scandinavia?\r\nMirja: Unfortunately, I've never experienced being stranded in Scandanavia, so I have no practical knowledge that would help...\r\nMirja: But it would be a good idea to move as little as necessary during the blizzard to preserve your stamina. I will search for a safe route out, so the rest of you should remain waiting here without wandering.\r\nMihono: She's gone. Will Mirja-san be okay by herself...?\r\nChie: We should just do as she told us and wait here.\r\nYui: Sorry... I'm feeling really hungry from all the exercise before.\r\nTsugumi: That reminds me. I made emergency rations just in case something like this happened. Would you all like some?\r\nKiyoka: Eh... You made them, Tsugumi-san...?\r\nMihono: Which means...\r\nYui: Tsugumi-san's home cooking!? Nothing would make me happier up on this mountain than eating a girl's home cooking~! Don't mind if I do~! Chew chew...\r\nKofuki: Oi, oi, do you have any idea what she put in those things!? Is it safe for her to dig in like that!?\r\nYui: BWHA... Wh-What is this? I've never tasted anything like it? What's in it, anyway!?\r\nTsugumi: A balanced assortment of meat and fish proteins, blended with various fruits, vegetables, and supplements, all processed for long term storage.\r\nTsugumi: As its purpose was to aid in survival in snowy mountain conditions, I paid no attention to the taste. Is there a problem with it?\r\nYui: I mean, it does taste like it'd be pretty nutritious, but my mouth is still all tingling and numb and mushy...\r\nKofuki: What kinda flavor is that! No matter what, there's nooo way I'm eating that crappy food of yours!\r\nTsugumi: Is the taste that bad? Chew chew... I think this is an acceptable level for food though...\r\nYui: Huh? I started feeling all funny. Like I'm getting all warmed up and energized!\r\nMihono: Really!?\r\nYui: Yeah! I'm feeling way more lively now, like I'm bursting with strength-!\r\nChie: Could those rations actually be effective?\r\nKiyoka: In that case, it might better if we tried to ignore the taste and ate them anyway.\r\nKofuki: No way! I'm not eating those... Achoo! Brrr. Dammit, is there anything we can do about this cold already?\r\nYui: If that's all you want, then I'll warm you right up with my burning hot body, Kofuki-san!\r\nKofuki: Quit grabbing at me.\r\nYui: Ehh, but you let Tsugumi-san get close, so what's the difference?\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san is fundamentally a catlike person. If you chase her she'll hiss at you, which is why it's best to wait for her to come to you.\r\nYui: Really! That's useful information! But I'm no good at waiting, you know~.\r\n\r\nYui: Aghh, that's it~! I can't take any more of this doing nothing waiting around for the blizzard to stop! Everyone, the time has come to use our last resort!\r\nTsugumi: A last resort in enduring the blizzard?\r\nYui: That's right, we'll all get naked and hug each other for warmth!\r\nTsugumi: I see, through direct physical contact and keeping the amount of skin exposed to open air at a minimum, such a method would allow us to preserve our body temperature.\r\nTsugumi: It's a common technique brought up in romantic movies and the like...\r\nKiyoka: If we went along with that, there wouldn't be any romance to it though...\r\nKofuki: You're supposed to do that in a shack or something, not out in the middle of the mountain!\r\nYui: The circumstances are so great that we can't even find one of those! We have to do this, to save all your lives... Pant pant... Come on! I'll start with Tsugumi-san-!\r\nTsugumi: Wh-Why are you starting with me!?\r\nYui: As the new member, don't you think this is the fastest way to deepen our friendship?\r\nYui: There's no time to waste; please take your clothes off! Or are you the type who likes having them taken off? Pant pant pant...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Yeti Discovery\r\n\r\nYui: Come on, Tsugumi-san! If you won't take those clothes off, I'll get them off for you~!\r\nTsugumi: Th-That's going a little too far...!\r\nMihono: AHH-! Yeti-!\r\nKofuki: For real!? Where?\r\nMihono: There! Look, over behind that tree!\r\nChie: It's hard to see through the blizzard... But I saw something white moving around just now!\r\nKiyoka: I think I see glowing eyes too... Eh... What should we do? It keeps coming closer to us...\r\nKofuki: Ohhh, so it finally showed up! The new aradama-chan!\r\nYui: I won't let it get away with interrupting my lovey dovey time with Tsugumi-san-!\r\nMihono: Wah, while we were talking, it keeps getting closer...!\r\nKiyoka: Somebody, help us-!\r\nMihono/Kiyoka/Chie: KYAAA-!!\r\nTsugumi: (As I thought, \"fear makes fools of us all\".)\r\nMirja: Did something happen? You were making an awful lot of noise. I found a way back down, so I came to show you all...\r\nChie: Say, Mihono-chan, was the yeti you saw...\r\nMihono: I-I'm sorry... I mean, she's white all over...\r\nYui: Ehh? What do you mean? What happened to the yeti?\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan was seeing things... And thought Mirja-san was a yeti.\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono! Which means, the first sighting as well...\r\nMihono: Sorry, I think it was because you were walking out ahead of us...\r\nKofuki: Oi oi, Mihocchi! There's a limit to crying wolf, you know!\r\nTsugumi: Kitora-san did look like the real thing, though.\r\nKofuki: Oi, you... Don't tell me you knew from the start?\r\nTsugumi: I thought I'd be able to collect a fair amount of practical data by letting the misunderstanding go on.\r\nKofuki: This is the problem with you...\r\nTsugumi: I came up with some good ideas for improving my emergency rations, so assist me in a few trials once we get back to the lab, okay?\r\nMirja: Sigh... A two meter tall giant covered in shaggy hair...?\r\nMirja: So that's how I appear in Asakura Mihono's eyes...\r\nMihono: I'm really sorry, Mirja-san! I've never thought that about you normally...!\r\nMirja: That innocent concern of yours doesn't make this any better. A two meter tall hairy giant...\r\nChie: A-Anyway, now that we know the way down the mountain, we should get going while the weather's cleared up.\r\nYui: That's right! And when we get down the mountain, hot spring~ hot spring~.\r\n\r\nMirja: I learned when I was searching for our route that this area of the mountain is actually directly behind a ski resort. It seems to be a popular location for snowboarding.\r\nKiyoka: Snowboarding! That sounds fun.\r\nTsugumi: In that case, why don't we try some snowboarding before heading home! Allow me to observe just how much stamina you all have left after being stranded in a blizzard.\r\nKofuki: Huh!? Why should we wear ourselves out for you!?\r\nTsugumi: This is valuable data!\r\nKofuki: ...Sigh. Well, since it sounds like I don't get a say in it, I'll tag along.\r\nMihono: Awesome-! Let's all go snowboarding before we leave!\r\nChie/Kiyoka: Lets!\r\nYui: Uuu, but the hot spring...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: The Origami Family Joins In\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Everyone, the entrance is this way. There really was a ski resort up here after all.\r\nKofuki: Snowboarding's whatever, but I guess I'll give it a shot before we head back.\r\nTsugumi: You say that, but you're a little excited for this, aren't you.\r\nKofuki: Wha... As if!\r\nMaki: You all seem to have carried out your mission successfully. Good work.\r\nKofuki: Huh!? What's Maki-senpai doing here?\r\nMaki: Good to see you too... After reviewing your combat data, Yukari-sama decided to institute training for toji on further missions in snowy conditions.\r\nMaki: And so, bringing some available toji up here, we rented this ski resort as a space for snowy combat training exercises.\r\nYume: Thaaaat's how it is! It's training where a whole bunch of toji go around fighting each other in the snow~!\r\nYume: So ready or not, here I come~!\r\nKofuki: Oi oi oi oi!!\r\nMaki: Hey, hold it, Yume. These girls just got back from a mission, so they must be exhausted, aren't they?\r\nKofuki: Yeah, we're totally beat. We want to get out of here already, so you mind if we skip this?\r\nTsugumi: But we were all going to go snowboarding before we left.\r\nKofuki: Oi-! Just shut up about that!\r\nMaki: Oh, so you still had the energy to fool around. Then I'll have to ask you to join this training. You can share with the others what you learned fighting in the snow.\r\nYume: I like it, I like it! With you onee-sans around, this'll get more fun~. Let's fight already!\r\nKofuki: You know... Would it kill you to read the mood a little...?\r\nTsugumi: Now now, Shichinosato-san, there's nothing to worry about. I thought something like this might happen and prepared these.\r\nKofuki: Huh? What's that? I already don't like where this is going.\r\nTsugumi: Fufu. These are my prized \"special emergency rations\", for warming your frozen body and restoring your energy before you know it.\r\nKofuki: Those're gonna taste like garbage again, aren't they!\r\nKofuki: But I guess they do work pretty good... Dammit, I don't think I've got a choice this time...\r\nTsugumi: About these \"special emergency rations\", I'll only offer them to anyone who beats me in a fight. If you want one, then go right ahead and challenge me.\r\nKofuki: Oi, quit screwing around. Just hand 'em out!\r\nTsugumi: But I want more data on all of you fighting in the snow.\r\nTsugumi: I have plenty to offer to anyone willing to help me out.\r\nKofuki: Whatever! I get it, so... I'll play along.\r\nMaki: You seem more willing now, at least.\r\nMaki: I should mention that Yukari-sama herself will also be overseeing this training. If you end up facing off against her, do your best not to disappoint.\r\nMaki: With that out of the way, let's start the practice battles."}, {"paste_key": "yedsqNPZ", "title": "Heart Pounding Mission in a Steamy Hot Spring", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/yedsqNPZ", "timestamp": "", "hits": "104", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://youtu.be/2WIMe2c68W4\r\n\r\n1: Being Too Polite Would be Impolite \r\n[Every chapter title is an onsen related idiom. It's hard to get across, so I went with whatever works.]\r\n\r\nChie: I'm sorry to call you out here so suddenly, Ellen-san, Yui-chan.\r\nYui: Don't worry about a thing! For you, Chie-san, I'd come running through hell or high water!\r\nEllen: That's right, Chie.\r\nChie: I'm glad to hear that then.\r\nEllen: It doesn't sound like you called us here to play around. Is this a mission?\r\nChie: That's right. Someone needs to suppress aradama that have infested a hot spring.\r\nEllen: Oh! A hot spring?\r\nYui: Count me in-!\r\nYui: First we can wash off the tiredness from getting there, then we can wash off the tiredness from getting rid of the aradama!\r\nChie: About that, from the sound of things, the aradama have taken up in the source of the springwater.\r\nChie: Because of that, they can no longer maintain the spring, so no one is allowed in.\r\nYui: Oh no!\r\nEllen: No one can enter the springs...? That's big trouble!\r\nChie: It seems like it. This month is the busy season for the inn, so the aradama are stopping their business.\r\nYui: ...I won't forgive them.\r\nYui: A hot springs inn without a hot spring is just an inn!\r\nYui: We have to stop these aradama as soon as possible!\r\nChie: It's a bit of a long trip, so why don't we meet back up after getting our things together? Would that be alright?\r\nEllen/Yui: Sure-!\r\n\r\nChie: Let's see... Mm, that should be everything. I'm all set.\r\nChie: \"I'm finished here. How are things with you two?\" Sent.\r\nChie: ...Ah, they already replied. Hmm, oh, it seems like they'll take a little longer.\r\nChie: That leaves me with some free time, but... What to do?\r\n\r\nChie: I ended up coming to the meeting spot early. Well... It's better than showing up late.\r\nMihono: Huh, Chii-nee? What're you doing with that suitcase?\r\nMihono: Are you going on a trip?\r\nChie: Just a bit of a long distance mission that came up.\r\nChie: It could end up taking the rest of the week, so I needed a few changes of clothes.\r\nMihono: Ehh!? So you won't be here this weekend!? That's too bad...\r\nMihono: I wanted to go on a sweets tour with you... But I guess we can't now?\r\nChie: Nnn... When you use those puppy dog eyes of yours, Mihono-chan...\r\nChie: But... I'm sorry. No matter how much I hurry, I probably won't be back before the weekend is over...\r\nMihono: Really... Okay! Since it's a mission, I know you can't help it!\r\nMihono: Who are you going with?\r\nYui: That'd be me!\r\nEllen: And me too!\r\nMihono: Yui and Ellen-san! Huh, I wouldn't expected you guys to get grouped together.\r\nYui: Think again, Mihono-chan! You see, Ellen-san and Chie-san both have an overwhelming motherly nature in common!\r\nChie: Mmm, I don't think I'm much of the motherly type. I'm an onee-san after all...\r\nYui: No no, look, you two have such huge motherly attributes right there!\r\nEllen: I see, our breasts, huh. I think you'd get along with Nene, Yuiyui.\r\nYui: I've heard the rumors too. I'd like to have a nice long chat with Nene someday!\r\nMihono: Looks like a fun team though, Chii-nee.\r\nChie: Fufu, I agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Neither Doctors nor Springwater (Can Cure Lovesickness)\r\n\r\nMihono: Hmm, what do I do now...\r\nKiyoka: Good morning, Hono-chan.\r\nMihono: Ah, morning, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: I heard you groaning back there. Did you forget to do your homework?\r\nMihono: Nah, I finished all of it this time. But that's not it, Chii-nee left on a long assignment yesterday.\r\nKiyoka: Oh, I heard about that from Yui-chan.\r\nKiyoka: She said \"There's a big aradama infestation, so it could take until the start of next week! Sorry, I won't be able to play with you this weekend!\"\r\nMihono: Did you have plans to do something with Yui?\r\nKiyoka: No, we didn't talk about anything.\r\nMihono: Ahaha, that's Yui alright.\r\nMihono: Actually, I was thinking of going somewhere with Chii-nee this weekend!\r\nKiyoka: Oh, so that's why you looked so disappointed.\r\nMihono: Yeah. What were you going to do this weekend, Kiyoka?\r\nMihono: Have you made any plans yet?\r\nKiyoka: I was planning on visiting a hot spring with a senpai from my school.\r\nKiyoka: We started talking about it a long time ago.\r\nMihono: A hot spring!\r\nMihono: Sounds nice. Do I know that senpai of yours? If it's okay with you two, I'd want to tag along!\r\nKiyoka: Mmhm, you know them. It's Juujou-san.\r\nKiyoka: If you want to go with us... It doesn't hurt to ask, so why don't we go talk to her together at lunchtime?\r\nMihono: Okay!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Juujou-saaan!\r\nHiyori: Kiyoka? I was looking for you. There's something I wanted to ask...\r\nMihono: Hey, it's Kaoru-san.\r\nKaoru: I'm guessing you two wanted to talk about the same thing. You want to go to the hot spring too?\r\nMihono: Yep, that's right! Are you going too?\r\nKaoru: Ellen was busy and I had nothing else to do, and that's when I heard about this trip.\r\nMihono: Hey, we're totally in the same boat! Hot springs are the best, aren't they?\r\nMihono: You get to soak in the water, and eat great food, and play table tennis.\r\nKaoru: Table tennis... I'm pretty good at that, you know?\r\nMihono: I'm not about to lose either!\r\nKiyoka: ...Umm, the hot spring we were planning on visiting doesn't actually have table tennis there.\r\nMihono: Ehh!? There's no table tennis...\r\nMihono: But I still feel like competing, so why don't we play it now?\r\nKaoru: Pass. Listen up, Mihono. Table tennis is always fun when there's a hot spring to get in nearby.\r\nKaoru: But if we do it here, we'd only be working up a sweat.\r\nMihono: Isn't working up a sweat a good thing?\r\nKaoru: It's just tiring. Without a hot spring to cure that tiredness, table tennis loses half its appeal.\r\nMihono: Isn't that a different appeal though? But if they don't have table tennis, we can always think up some other kind of exercise.\r\nKaoru: A bigger workout gets another pass. Table tennis is just barely at the acceptable level of exercise. Ideally, it should be something we can do in our room.\r\nMihono: Then... How about a pillow fight?\r\nKiyoka: I think we'd need a few more people than just the four of us for a good pillow fight.\r\nHiyori: We can think about what we'll do later. For starters, we need to tell the inn we're bringing more people.\r\nKiyoka: Please do... Ah, what about ghost stories?\r\nHiyori: Ghost stories? I've never done that before, but is telling scary stories really that interesting?\r\nKiyoka: It's interesting because it's scary! And aside from ghost stories, we can talk about love too!\r\nHiyori: Talk about love...!?\r\nKaoru: That's about as standard as it gets, but... Does any of us even have a partner?\r\nKaoru: Just putting this out there, but I don't.\r\nHiyori: A-As if I have someone like that!\r\nMihono: I don't think I do either. Besides, what's more important now is our duty as toji!\r\nHiyori: That's right, well said, Mihono!\r\nKiyoka: I don't either... So I guess we should tell scary stories after all.\r\nMihono: Ughh... So that's how it'll be. I'm not great with scary stories...\r\nKiyoka: Fufufu, get yourself ready, Hono-chan. I'll have a lot of scary stories in store for everyone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: A Waste of One's Efforts\r\n\r\nHiyori: We can't go in the spring?\r\nLandlady: I'm very sorry. Because aradama appeared in the source of the springwater, we can't maintain it anymore...\r\nKiyoka: But we came all this way... What should we do?\r\nHiyori: There's nothing to think about. We should just exterminate those aradama.\r\nMihono: I agree with Juujou-san!\r\nMihono: And after we beat the aradama, we can get in the hot spring. It's two birds with one stone.\r\nKiyoka: ...You're right. We came this far, so we can't leave without getting in the water!\r\nKaoru: You all look like you made your minds up.\r\nHiyori: Are you against this, Kaoru?\r\nKaoru: It seems like a lot of work.\r\nKaoru: ...That's how I feel, but somebody's got to do this. I'll go along with you guys.\r\nHiyori: I've never seen you put up that little resistance before.\r\nKaoru: It'd be way more annoying coming out here and not even getting in a hot spring, after all.\r\nKaoru: Seems like a lot of work though.\r\nHiyori: Then that's settled. Where is the spring's source?\r\nLandlady: It's up that mountain...\r\nHiyori: Ah, that way? Good, we can leave now.\r\nMihono/Kiyoka: Yeah!\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nLandlady: P-Please wait. It's dangerous if you leave right now. The sun will be setting soon, and the forecast said the snowfall tonight will be terrible.\r\nMihono: Snow up on a mountain at night...\r\nKiyoka: I'm worried that we won't be able to stop the aradama.\r\nKaoru: It can be dangerous up on a snowy mountain if you're not used to it. What do you want to do?\r\nHiyori: Let's see...\r\nLandlady: U-Um, three toji had already set out to suppress the aradama before you arrived...\r\nHiyori: What?\r\nLandlady: I'm sorry, I should have told you right away.\r\nLandlady: They took care of the aradama in town yesterday, and today they went to the spring's source...\r\nKarou: If there's already toji dealing with it, why don't we just wait here and see how things go tonight?\r\nKaoru: They might even be suppressing the aradama right now.\r\nHiyori: I can't deny that, but... What do you two think?\r\nKiyoka: I think we should do what Kaoru-san says and wait here tonight.\r\nKiyoka: Fighting in the dark and snow... It sounds sort of scary...\r\nMihono: If I had to say, I think I'm with Kiyoka on this.\r\nKaoru: It's three against one, Hiyori.\r\nHiyori: I-I never said I was against waiting here!\r\nHiyori: We'll stay here at the inn tonight! Got that!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: This is something that actually happened to my mother... It was in... That's right, it was an inn just like this one.\r\nMihono: Gulp.\r\nKiyoka: My mother went on a trip with some friends to a hot spring. They got in the spring, ate a good meal, and relaxed... Before they knew it, it was 10 at night.\r\nKaoru: Hey, that's almost just like us here.\r\nHiyori: D-Don't make unnecessary comments in the middle of the story!\r\nKaoru: You getting scared-?\r\nHiyori: N-N-N-Nobody's scared! Kiyoka! Just keep going!\r\nKiyoka: \"The water was so nice, wasn't it?\" \"Want to go get back in?\" As they chatted like that into the night, they heard a voice from the other side of the sliding door.\r\nKiyoka: \"Would any of you guests like a massage?\"\r\nKaoru: That's sexual harassment.\r\nKiyoka: No, apparently it was a woman's voice. My mother refused, and they didn't hear from the voice again.\r\nKiyoka: But... It was strange.\r\nMihono: Wh-What was?\r\nKiyoka: They heard the voice from the other side of the sliding door, right? But on the other side of that... There should have been a locked door.\r\nHiyori: Eek...!\r\nKiyoka: My mother and her friends quickly realized it. \"Eh? What does that mean? We did lock the door, didn't we?\"\r\nKiyoka: \"...Should we go check?\"\r\nKaoru: Oh, there's a death flag.\r\nHiyori: ...Gulp.\r\nKiyoka: They found their courage and slid open the door. But there was no one there.\r\nMihono: Th-The lock! Did they lock the door or not!?\r\nKiyoka: It still seemed to be locked. They looked out through the peephole and couldn't see anyone in the hallway.\r\nHiyori: W-Well then there wasn't anyone there, was there.\r\nKiyoka: My mother and her friends thought the same thing, and started feeling safer. But, at that moment, they heard a knocking at the door.\r\nKiyoka: Like...\r\nHiyori/Mihono: GYAAAA-----!!\r\nKaoru: Who's at the door this late? Did you attract a real ghost by telling scary stories?\r\nHiyori: A-A-A-As if something like that could happen! Ghosts are just a silly superstition!\r\nKaoru: If they're not real, then you go answer the door, Hiyori.\r\nHiyori: W-Wait! R-Rock paper scissors...! We'll decide who answers it with rock paper scissors!\r\nMihono: I can't afford to lose...! Where there's a will, there's a way!\r\nKiyoka: I don't think you need to be so serious about this...\r\nKaoru: Then, here we go... Rock paper scissors!\r\nEveryone: Shoot!\r\nKiyoka: Ah, I lost. I'll be right back.\r\nKiyoka: Hello, who is i... KYAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nHiyori/Mihono: UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!\r\nYui: Kiyoka-chan, you're so waaaaaaaaaarm!\r\nMihono: ...Wait, Yui!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4:\u3000Something's Better than Nothing\r\n\r\n--Several hours earlier.\r\n\r\nChie: Those must be the aradama holed up in the spring's source.\r\nEllen: There's a lot more of them than I expected.\r\nYui: We can handle that many no problem! Just have to wipe 'em out with a BANG!\r\nYui: And when we get back, the hot spring will be waiting!\r\nChie: ...What do you think, Ellen-san?\r\nEllen: We don't have to push our luck here. Snow, night, and the mountains would be a bad mix.\r\nChie: I agree. We located the aradama, so we should head back for today.\r\n\r\nChie: So we returned here, and the landlady told us more toji had arrived.\r\nEllen: And I was surprised to see you, Kaoru! Why did you come?\r\nKaoru: Just a coincidence. Me and Mihono joined in on the hot springs trip Hiyori and Kiyoka planned.\r\nYui: Ehh, you didn't tell me anything about that.\r\nKiyoka: Eeep! Don't look at me!\r\nYui: But, now I have Kiyoka-chan with me, so all's well that ends well!\r\nYui: Warm me up, Kiyoka-chan! Pant, pant, sniff, sniff!\r\nKiyoka: I don't want a hug-!? Just- let- go- please-!\r\nHiyori: ...Is it okay to let her do that?\r\nMihono: Kiyoka and Yui are really friendly, so it's okay!\r\nMihono: Anyway, I'm glad it wasn't a ghost. Right, Juujou-san!\r\nEllen: A ghost?\r\nHiyori: I-It's not important!\r\nKiyoka: Uuu, they forgot about me... Somebody, helppp...\r\nHiyori: Anyway, it's good to see that you three were the toji they sent out.\r\nHiyori: We'll be joining you tomorrow.\r\nEllen: That'd be a big help! We were worried about what to do, since there were so many aradama!\r\nChie: Fufu, we can take care of them together and then all join in back at the hot spring.\r\nEllen: Sounds nice, Chie! Nothing takes off the fatigue like a hot spring!\r\nYui: Hooray-! They say good things come in pairs, and I see plenty of pairs around me! \r\n\r\nChie: [peaceful sleeping]...\r\nEllen: [heavier sleeping]...\r\nYui: [homosexual sleeping]...\r\nMihono: They're all asleep.\r\nKaoru: They had to march their way through a mountain in the snow. They must be worn out.\r\nKiyoka: ...Yui-chan was actually tired.\r\nKiyoka: Um, is there anything we can do to help them?\r\nHiyori: Besides going to eliminate the aradama together?\r\nKiyoka: Yes! Like, for example... Getting a nutritious meal ready for them!\r\nKaoru: We're at an inn, you know? I'm sure the people here can make something better than us.\r\nKaoru: Why don't we ask them to make their favorites for them at least?\r\nKiyoka: That sounds nice too...!\r\nMihono: Also, why don't we take care of the aradama ourselves?\r\nMihono: That's what we were going to do at first anyway, right?\r\nHiyori: We hadn't decided on that yet... But no, that could work.\r\nHiyori: Should we do that?\r\nEllen: Nnn... Kaoru... That's not a kanpyou maki... That's chikuwa.\r\nKaoru: What kinda dream is that. Anyway, why don't we all just go together?\r\nKiyoka: ...I agree with Hono-chan and Juujou-san.\r\nHiyori: Heh, three against one, is it?\r\nKaoru: Fine then, I'll go.\r\n\r\nEllen: It's a beautiful morning! Wake up, Chie, Yui!\r\nChie: Yawn... Morning, everyone... Hm? Where's Mihono-chan?\r\nYui: Bad news! Kiyoka-chan and them... They asked the landlady to make our favorite food, then went ahead to deal with the aradama!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5:\u3000All Things in Moderation\r\n\r\nMihono: I wonder if the landlady made their favorite foods after all.\r\nKiyoka: I don't think we have to worry about that. It was short notice, but I'm glad she was willing to hear us out.\r\nHiyori: Agreed. I'm sure they're eating their fill right about now.\r\nKaoru: Yawn... If we were back at the inn, we'd be in the middle of breakfast now, huh. Never thought I'd be getting up this early on a hot springs trip.\r\nHiyori: You can take all the time you want in the spring after these aradama are cleared out.\r\nHiyori: Let's keep moving.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: According to the map, this should be the source, but...\r\nHiyori: They're all over.\r\nMihono: Ten... Twenty... Thirty... There's too many to count!\r\nKaoru: Way too many. Too much for us to deal with by ourselves.\r\nHiyori: ......You're right. Instead of acting cool, we should send a message back. ...Does anyone have signal?\r\nKaoru: Just barely, but I can get through.\r\nHiyori: Good. Kiyoka and Mihono, you should move around softly so the cold doesn't get to you.\r\nMihono: Okay!\r\nKiyoka: Uuu, it's so cold, Hono-chan. If only we'd brought some hot tea with us.\r\nMihono: I know, right? When it's this cold, you... Ah... Ah...\r\nKiyoka: Ah?\r\nMihono: ACHOO!!\r\nKaoru: Idiot! Why'd you have to go and sneeze at a time like this!\r\nMihono: Ughh, I'm sorry-!\r\nHiyori: Tch, they noticed us!\r\nKiyoka: Wh-What do we do now!?\r\nHiyori: We don't have a choice... Kiyoka, stick with me!\r\nKiyoka: Ah, o-okay!\r\nKaoru: So that means you're with me, Mihono.\r\nMihono: Got it!\r\nKaoru: Come on, here we go!\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\n\r\nChie: We should have told them just how many aradama there were.\r\nEllen: Even if it's a little dangerous, they were only worried about us.\r\nChie: I'm glad they felt that way, but... As an onee-san, there are some times you have to get angry.\r\nYui: They said they'd hide out and wait for us to get there, so it's not like you have to get mad at them, right?\r\nEllen: A good call! That was smart of them, wasn't it!\r\nChie: ...Did you hear something just now?\r\nEllen: I did. It sounded like someone was fighting...\r\nYui: No no no! It didn't sound \"like someone's fighting\", that is someone fighting!\r\nChie: We have to hurry!\r\n\r\nMihono: There's just too many aradamaaa...\r\nKaoru: Watch your head, Mihono!\r\nMihono: Awawa!\r\nKaoru: Damnit, where'd all that energy you had at the start go?\r\nMihono: Sorry... I ran out of concentration...\r\nKiyoka: Hyaah-!?\r\nHiyori: Tch! Hang in there, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Uuu... I can't do anything, against all of them...\r\nEllen: Oh! Looks like a hard fight! Chie, let's back them up!\r\nChie: Ellen-san, you go to Mihono-chan and Kaoru-san. Yui-chan, you come with me!\r\nYui: Right!\r\nEllen: Kaoru-! I'm here to rescue you-!\r\nKaoru: Ellen? We're saved!\r\nYui: You okay, Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKiyoka: Chie-san! Yui-chan!\r\nChie: Juujou-san, leave Kiyoka-chan to Yui-chan and I.\r\nHiyori: Alright, watch after her. HAAAH!\r\n\r\nKaoru: Guess that's the end of them. Ahh, I'm beat.\r\nEllen: That's a big win!\r\nKiyoka: Thank you, Chie-san.\r\nChie: Fufu, I'm your onee-san after all. Don't mention it.\r\nHiyori: Thanks... Ellen, Chie, Yui. You saved us.\r\nYui: Think nothing of it! Let's just race back to the spring!\r\nMihono: Yeah-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts\r\n\r\nEllen: Now for the hot spring!\r\nHiyori: We just came in from the cold, after all. We should warm up before we get sick.\r\nKaoru: Ahh, finally, we can get in. Come on, Nene.\r\nNene: Nene-!\r\nChie: Fufu, it's been a while since we took a bath together, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: I'll wash your back for you, Chii-nee.\r\nChie: Okay, I'd appreciate it.\r\nYui: Mihono-chan, behind Chie-san... Guhe, guhehe...\r\nYui: Kiyoka-chan, why don't we try that too?\r\nKiyoka: I refuse!\r\n\r\nYui: BWHAA-!\r\nMihono: Blood came spewing out of Yui's nose!?\r\nYui: Pant, pant... J-Just ignore that, l-let me wash your... BWHAA!!\r\nMihono: It did it again!?\r\nEllen: You might have a thin nasal membrane, Yuiyui. It's probably best if you stay out of the hot spring.\r\nYui: But that's too cruel!\r\nChie: Why don't you try calming down a little for now? Here, come here.\r\nYui: Chie-san's are... This close to me... BWHAA!\r\nChie: Kyaa!? Ellen-san, help me get her out of here!\r\nEllen: Got it!\r\nYui: I'm spent... Nothing's coming out anymore... Gagh.\r\nKaoru: That's fine, then you won't be getting your nosebleed in the water.\r\nNene: Nene-.\r\nKaoru: Ahh... Feels like I came back to life. Some kanpyou maki would hit the spot right now.\r\nMihono: Kanpyou maki... Should we ask the landlady for some?\r\nKaoru: Maybe later... Anyway, come on in, Mihono. The water's great.\r\nMihono: Okay! ...Ahhhh, it's so warm.\r\nKaoru: Feels better because of how cold it was out on the mountain. Makes it all worth it.\r\nMihono: Ahh, sorry I messed things up for us, back there.\r\nKaoru: Eh, all's well that ends well. No point overthinking it when we were gonna fight anyway.\r\nMihono: Okay, thanks, Kaoru-san!\r\nEllen: What are you talking about now, Kaoru?\r\nKaoru: Nothing much. Anyway, what happened with Yui?\r\nChie: She'll be fine; we spoke to the landlady. When she's feeling better she can join us.\r\nEllen: With that settled... Nnn-! Nothing beats an hot spring after a mission!\r\nChie: I know. Swinging an okatana around like that is always so hard on your back and shoulders, isn't it?\r\nHiyori: What are you talking about...? Phew, I can feel the springwater soaking in.\r\nKiyoka: ...Um, Yui-chan was sound asleep in the dressing room... What happened?\r\nMihono: It sounds like Yui has thin nasal membranes and needed some rest.\r\nKiyoka: Her nasal membranes...! Then I guess we should just let her sleep, right!\r\nChie: Anyway, you all gave me a scare this morning. I never thought you'd go and leave without us.\r\nEllen: I know! It's rude of you to leave your friends behind like that, Kaoru!\r\nKaoru: Hey, you know I wanted to sleep in. But Kiyoka here wouldn't stop until we did something to help you guys out.\r\nKiyoka: Awawa! I-I didn't mean for it to get out of hand like that, but you all looked so tired, so I just wondered if there was something we could do to help...\r\nEllen: Well, thank you very much, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: You're welcome... (bubble bubble)\r\nMihono: Kiyoka... Are you embarrassed?\r\nKiyoka: ...Just a little, maybe.\r\nYui: I sensed something sort of yuri happening, so Yamashiro Yui is back in action-! Everyone, come let me wash your... BWHAA!\r\nEllen: So much for back in action.\r\nChie: Honestly, someone's going to have to keep watch over her.\r\nYui: Why does this have to happen to me... Just try a little harder, my nasal membranes-!!"}, {"paste_key": "KfuxfrQ8", "title": "3-1 Assembly", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/KfuxfrQ8", "timestamp": "", "hits": "157", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntmIHzjnP8U\r\n\r\n1: Back with Your Leader\r\n\r\nMihono: Ehehehe.\r\nKofuki: What's with you, Mihocchi? Don't laugh for no reason like that, it's creepy. Did you eat something off the floor again?\r\nYui: Kofuki-san, it isn't creepy in the slightest! Isn't it cute, isn't she lovable, don't you have to fight the urge to hug her tight when you see that angelic smile!\r\nMihono: Ahaha, uh... Well. I was just thinking, we're all pretty awesome aren't we, and I started laughing, I guess?\r\nHana: Are you including me in there too? Did I do anything that impressive?\r\nMihono: I mean, all of us went to the netherworld, and we fought that great aradama, and we brought back Tsubakuro-san! That's all amazing, right?\r\nHana: Yeah, I can't deny that. Though with those two from the elite guard helping, I think anyone could have gotten through there.\r\nKofuki: Even without them around, it would've been no problem for us.\r\nKiyoka: I'm just glad we were able to get Tsubakuro-san back safely.\r\nChie: .........\r\nKiyoka: Ah, I'm sorry...\r\nChie: You didn't say anything wrong, Kiyoka-chan.\r\nKiyoka: But still, it feels like... I'm sorry...\r\nKofuki: Are you still doing this? You haven't gotten over helping save Tsubakuro Yume yet?\r\nChie: You know what that girl did to everyone in Mokusa! Of course I wouldn't get over it that easily!\r\nMihono: Chii-nee...\r\nChie: ...I'm sorry. Let me go collect my thoughts for a while.\r\nKofuki: Seriously...\r\nHana: But if I were put in Chie-san's position, I'd have a hard time accepting this too. At least, after what Tsubakuro-san did.\r\nMirja: I can fully imagine how Setouchi Chie is feeling. However, Tsubakuro Yume's strength is vital to us now.\r\nMirja: Regardless of the circumstances that brought us here, she is an indispensable ally to have.\r\nMihono: ......She'll be fine. I know Chii-nee will get through this.\r\n\r\nMaki: It feels so much better having Yume back. I could never express my gratitude to those girls.\r\nMaki: And more than anything, Suzuka. Thank you for staying at my side.\r\nSuzuka: I felt the same as you did about rescuing Yume. You don't need to thank me.\r\nSuzuka: Now if only Yomi-san would come back, the elite guard could all be together again.\r\nAkane: Ah, you were in here.\r\nSuzuka: Akane-sama...? Did you need us for something?\r\nAkane: I didn't want to distract you from the operation by mentioning this earlier, but there's something I should tell you two.\r\nAkane: In actuality, along with Ichikishimahime on this ship, my sister, Origami Yukari, is here as well.\r\nMaki: Yukari-sama is here!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Mother\r\n\r\nHiyori: So the Origami Yukari who was supposed to be recovering in a hospital was hiding in an armed submarine.\r\nAkane: This submarine is fully equipped with medical facilities, so I wasn't exactly lying.\r\nKanami: Yukari-sama's not an aradama anymore, right?\r\nYukari: Yes, that's right.\r\nHiyori: I'm not so sure.\r\nHiyori: For twenty years, she was Tagitsuhime. They said you separated, but I'm not buying it that easily.\r\nHiyori: And even if you are just an ordinary person again, can you say for sure you aren't being manipulated?\r\nYukari: I can do nothing but ask you to believe me. Juujou, do you still consider me unforgivable?\r\nHiyori: From the moment the great aradama possessed you twenty years ago, until the day she passed away, my mother lamented everything. If you think I'll forgive you now...!\r\nYukari: Juujou, Etou, I'm sorry.\r\nYukari: Twenty years ago, on the day of the disaster, I was in charge of the special unit and oversaw the final battle your mothers were a part of.\r\nYukari: My duty was to force Tagitsuhime, who was clinging to our world, back to the netherworld, and seal the opening.\r\nYukari: In doing so, Kagari... Juujou's mother, would fall with Tagitsuhime to the bottom of the netherworld and diffuse into nothing.\r\nYukari: However, Tagitsuhime sought way to avoid annihilation. In exchange for saving your mother's lives, it proposed to assimilate with me.\r\nYukari: To avoid losing my friends, I took in the aradama who had left thousands of victims...\r\nYukari: I'm sure you know the rest. Etou and Juujou's mothers, Minato and Kagari, I failed to save them both, and I alone was left alive.\r\nKanami: You know, my mother seemed happy until she died. I guess \"until she died\" is a weird way of putting that though.\r\nKanami: She taught me all about swordfighting too, so I think she was proud of her time as a toji.\r\nHiyori: Your mother was...?\r\nYukari: I see... And Shidou, Konohana. Good work on your recovery of Tsubakuro.\r\nMaki: Right...\r\nSuzuka: Though, without the help of Kitora-san and Asakura-san here, as well as their companions, our recovery of Yume would never have been possible.\r\nYukari: Asakura? Where have I... And that okatana, Kashuu Kiyomitsu... No... Could it be coincidence?\r\nAkane: It isn't, actually. I was curious and looked into her myself.\r\nAkane: This girl's mother was Asakura Hikari. She was one of the toji who joined in the fight during the disaster.\r\nYukari: Looking closer, I can see the resemblance.\r\nMihono: Eh!? You knew my mom?\r\nYukari: Yes... She was a very impressive toji.\r\nMihono: Impressive?\r\nMihono: (Huhh... That's weird? They told me, even though she was chosen by Kashuu Kiyomitsu, she was so useless you wouldn't believe it though...)\r\nYukari: It's too much for this to be chance. In which case, is it the will of Kashuu Kiyomitsu?\r\nMihono: Umm, what are you talking about?\r\nYukari: The time may come that you one day understand. For the sake of that day, become as strong as you can be. Continue marching forward, never neglecting your training.\r\nYukari: Asakura Mihono, I will remember that name. I have high expectations of your progress.\r\nMihono: Th-Thank you very much!\r\nYukari: The girl chosen by Kashuu Kiyomitsu... Is this fate as well?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: What a Toji Should Do (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: Nnn~, I can't get her out of my head.\r\nYui: What's that, there's someone you're interested in? If it's me, you know you're always welcome!\r\nKiyoka: Eh- Hono-chan's interested in someone!? Who is it? Do I know them!?\r\nMihono: I didn't say anything like that! How'd you get that confused?\r\nKiyoka: Oh, that's not it...?\r\nKofuki: Come on, you know someone as straightforward as Mihocchi could never be thinking about romance.\r\nMihono: I don't wanna hear it from you, Fukki.\r\nHana: So who's on your mind then...?\r\nMihono: It's Yukari-sama. I can't stop thinking about what she told me.\r\nMihono: I mean, it sounded really important, but she never told me anything else.\r\nMirja: It's true it seemed significant, but don't tell me you've been stuck on that all this time? It's been three days since we spoke to her.\r\nMihono: But it's bugging me!\u3000Aggh~, it's driving me nuts. Maybe I should just go ask her!\r\nMirja: I'm afraid that won't be possible. To avoid the possibility of an attack from Tagitsuhime, the submarine has already left the coast.\r\nMihono: Don't tell me that~! What am I supposed to do about how messed up I'm feeling then!?\r\nHana: Why not try distracting yourself with your duties? There's always aradama to be dealt with.\r\nKiyoka: Our duties... But what exactly will we be doing from now on?\r\nKiyoka: We lost Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, but Yukari Sama is in good health, and Tsubakuro-san was saved... What's going to happen with our investigation team?\r\nMirja: We should--\r\nAnnouncement: Aradama have appeared in the city. Toji should move to intercept at once. I repeat--\r\nKofuki: Nice timing, just when this was getting boring! I love you, my aradama-chan!\r\nMihono: Fiiine, I'll blow away all this frustration!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: What a Toji Should Do (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Ahh~, much better!\r\nKiyoka: Are you feeling better about what Yukari-sama said now?\r\nMihono: Well it's not like I can do anything about it, so there's no point thinking about it. I think I'll be fine like this.\r\nKofuki: That's a musclebrain for you; she already forgot about it.\r\nMihono: And again, I don't wanna hear it from you, Fukki!\r\nHana: What's most important is we managed to get here and deal with the aradama before they could cause a lot of damage.\r\nYui: We make the best team, don't we!\r\nKiyoka: I'm feeling a little relieved too. I don't know what will happen to our team, but I'm sure what I need to do won't change.\r\nKiyoka: We'll keep protecting everyone from aradama. That's what really matters, isn't it?\r\nMirja: Whatever the circumstances, we are still toji. We take up okatana to exorcise and suppress aradama.\r\nMirja: Even if we manage to suppress the great aradama Tagitsuhime, noro won't simply vanish.\r\nMirja: Our fight against aradama will continue regardless. Whatever reason we end up fighting for, so long as we don't lose sight of that, our path will always be clear.\r\nKiyoka: I understand.\r\nKofuki: That's so stupid. Were you really worried about that? We're toji, so we cut up aradama. That's all you have to care about.\r\nKiyoka: Not everybody's as simple as you, Kofuki-san.\r\nKofuki: You... Did you just call me simple!? You sure started talking big for someone who used to be too shy to say anything.\r\nKofuki: And you too... How long're you gonna be all moody for, Chichie? Don't you think you're overthinking things too?\r\nChie: ...Maybe you're right.\r\nKofuki: Come on... It's getting old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Unyielding Feelings (1)\r\n\r\nChie: I'm sorry, Mihono-chan. It's like Kofuki-chan said. I'm only bringing everyone down.\r\nChie: I know we have no choice but to work together, but I just can't forgive Tsubakuro-san after all. I'm not a very good onee-chan, am I.\r\nMihono: No, I get it... I know how you feel, Chii-nee.\r\nChie: Looking back on it, I was the same with Mirja-san. I was too stubborn to let go of my suspicions of her...\r\nChie: Here I was thinking I'd become a little more of an adult, but with how carried away I get with my feelings, it's like I'm still a child.\r\nMihono: If somebody hurt the people close to me, I wouldn't forgive them either.\r\nMihono: I think there's some things people just can't give up on. It doesn't have to make sense, but that's okay.\r\nChie: ...Thank you, Mihono-chan.\r\nAnnouncement: Aradama have appeared in the residential area. Toji should move to intercept at once. I repeat--\r\nChie: Phew... Now then, it's time we did our duty as toji, isn't it?\r\nMihono: Right!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Unyielding Feelings (2)\r\n\r\nYui: And that's job well done!\r\nKofuki: Felt like those aradama-chan weren't even fighting back. I hope we get to go up against something bigger next time.\r\nKiyoka: Eh... I'm fine with them being this weak...\r\nHana: Hang on, Kiyoka-san. Weren't you just saying you'd protect everyone from the aradama?\r\nKiyoka: Uuu... I-I'll try my best!\r\nMirja: Another unit will handle cleanup from here. We're withdrawing. Move quickly, everyone.\r\nYui: Okaaay.\r\n\r\nMihono: Huh? Are you not going back, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: I thought I'd get a little fresh air first.\r\nMihono: Then I'll stay here with you.\r\nChie: Hey, Mihono-chan. This is a really good team, isn't it? Everyone is proud of their role as a toji.\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan might be happy doing nothing but fighting aradama, but she's still a good girl who looks after everyone.\r\nChie: But out there, there are toji happy just to turn their okatana on other people. Why do you think an okatana would choose someone like that?\r\nMihono: You mean Tsubakuro-san? But, saying she's happy to use her okatana on people... I'm not sure about that...\r\nChie: It might be hard to believe, but I heard from the people at the hidden village. About what happened that day.\r\nChie: She came from nowhere and tore through all the toji protecting that place. Those girls, who were such respectful toji, she humiliated them as if she were just there to flaunt her strength.\r\nMihono: ...If things ended up so we had to work together with Tsubakuro-san on a mission, what would you do?\r\nChie: Whether or not I get along with someone, things are different on a mission. I wouldn't do anything to get in the way of the task at hand. You don't have to worry.\r\nMihono: I wasn't worried, you know? You're all reliable and everything, Chii-nee!\r\nChie: Even as you say that, you can't hide it on your face. You're a bad liar, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Ahhh~...\r\nChie: Alright, we should head back. If we stay much later, Mirja-san will scold us.\r\nMihono: Yeah, you're right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Living With Pain\r\n\r\nYume: Pant, pant... Ughhh... Cough...\r\nMaki: Are you okay, Yume?\r\nYume: Yeah... I'm fine... Cough cough cough...\r\nSuzuka: You don't look to be doing very well.\r\nMaki: Even after going all the way to the netherworld to bring you back...\r\nSuzuka: Her body is struggling with reverting to how it was before taking in noro.\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san, Suzuka-onee-san, it's not the same as before.\r\nYume: It hurts, but the doctor said I shouldn't die, so... If I get to live, then it's already so much better than before.\r\nSuzuka: Still...\r\nYume: I told you... I'm fine! I'm not that weak!\r\nMaki: Right. I know you aren't.\r\nYume: But, were you two always this nice? All you've been doing is looking after me.\r\nMaki: Of course we have. We're like family.\r\nYume: Like family... Ehehe.\r\nYume: Hey, Maki-onee-san, that strap on your okatana...\r\nMaki: Ah, it's yours, Yume. I've just been borrowing it for a while.\r\nSuzuka: Before you were saved, Maki-san was running about all over the country together with that strap. Can you believe her?\r\nYume: Running all over...?\r\nMaki: What? It wasn't a big deal.\r\nSuzuka: Not a big deal? You seemed to be repeating one reckless thing after another to me?\r\nMaki: We don't have to go over that in front of Yume.\r\n>Suzuka: I suppose you're right... Then I'll save the rest for when we go back.\r\n>Maki: ...Please be gentle.\r\n>Yume: Ahaha, Suzuka-onee-san still pushes you around like she used to.\r\n>Maki: Suzuka's just too much for me.\r\nYume: Cough, cough, cough... Ughhh...\r\nSuzuka: Some blood came out... Don't move, I'll clean you up right away.\r\nYume: Thanks... Cough, cough, cough... But, I have to get stronger... I can't be weak now...\r\nMaki: No, Yume. You shouldn't force yourself. Otherwise, all the effort in saving you would be for nothing.\r\nSuzuka: That's right. What matters most now is that you rest.\r\nYume: Fine, I get it already.\r\nYume: Oh yeah... Can I ask you something? The netherworld... It's really big, isn't it... How did you find me there?\r\nMaki: Well--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: New Orders (1)\r\n\r\nAkane: I've gathered you all here today to explain the role of your investigation team going forward.\r\nAkane: To begin with, Souraku Yuzuki, who was in charge of your unit until now, has been relieved of that duty. I, Origami Akane, will be taking that position. From here on out, please act under my command.\r\nAkane: Now, in regards to your current duties, the safeguarding of Takirihime and Ichikishimahime will be your top priority.\r\nAkane: If either of them, or especially both, are defeated by and absorbed by Tagitsuhime, then the world could be exposed to a crisis beyond anything we've seen before.\r\nAkane: We need to do everything possible to prevent that from happening. While continuing to suppress aradama, I will need you continually in a position to quickly respond to any actions Tagitsuhime may take.\r\nAkane: At the same time, you will need to be searching for a method to defeat Tagitsuhime. I realize this is a lot to ask of you, but please do the best you can.\r\nHana: That sounds like a little too much responsibility for us...\r\nKofuki: Why don't we just go beat up Tagitsuhime's main body in the netherworld? Wouldn't that be way easier?\r\nMihono: You would think that, wouldn't you, Fukki. Though I think we should do that too.\r\nAkane: Unfortunately, with the netherworld being a near-infinite space, identifying Tagitsuhime's location would be effectively impossible.\r\nYui: Umm, but wait, then how did we find the great aradama back with Tsubakuro-san?\r\nKiyoka: That's right... It did take some time, but it didn't feel like an infinite space over there.\r\nAkane: There's a specific reason why you were able to confront the great aradama which had bound Tsubakuro-san to the netherworld-- designated as Great Aradama Kai.\r\nAkane: Without a special link to the netherworld, we can't hope to identify our target's location within the netherworld. Though with Kai we cleared that condition.\r\nChie: What condition...?\r\nAkane: With both Great Aradama Kai's link to Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, and Tsubakuro Yume's connection to the elite guard, we managed to reach their coordinates.\r\nAkane: However, in this case--\r\nAnnouncer: Aradama have appeared, aradama have appeared, the location is--\r\nAkane: It sounds like there's aradama to deal with. I can tell you the rest after you're done suppressing them. All of you, please hurry to the scene.\r\nMirja: Understood!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: New Orders (2)\r\n\r\nAkane: Good work out there. Now then, I'll continue where I left off.\r\nAkane: As I told you before, given our current situation, destroying Tagitsuhime's true body in the netherworld is impossible.\r\nAkane: On top of that, after losing Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi, we are in need of finding something else to destroy her.\r\nKiyoka: Something else... Like what?\r\nAkane: I'd like to ask you to include that in your investigation.\r\nKofuki: What, you mean we're starting from scratch? Must be easy sitting cozy in here while we do all the work.\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki, please be careful with what you have to say.\r\nAkane: No, she's not wrong. I'm sorry to put this much of a burden on you. Even so, could you please search for a method?\r\nMirja: As it's a part of our mission, we have no reason to refuse. We'll work diligently to meet your expectations.\r\nAkane: Thank you very much. Also, at the present time, I would like to officially add both Yamashiro Yui and Suzumoto Hana to this investigation team.\r\nMihono: Huh? You two weren't officially with us before?\r\nHana: Technically we've still only been considered temporary reinforcements.\r\nYui: Wait, seriously!?\r\nHana: Why are you acting surprised? They must have told you this before.\r\nYui: Ahh~, I remember something like that, but when I heard I'd get to join with the famous investigation team loaded with cuties, I was so happy about it, I think I ended up forgetting everything else. Teehee!\r\nHana: Don't give me \"Teehee!\" Remember? When the raid on the Origami estate happened, you forgot to tell everyone else about me!\r\nHana: Thanks to that, Kofuki-san nearly chopped my head off!\r\nYui: .........Did I do that? Teehee!\r\nHana: I can't believe you... Back then, when I read the mission report, it said Yamashiro Yui was a hardworking girl who enthusiastically did her duty, you know.\r\nHana: But when girls are involved, it's a different story...? It took me a while to understand.\r\nChie: Ufufu, that's Yui-chan alright.\r\nYui: Ahaha, I guess that's me for you, so I'll introduce myself again. Let's get along~!\r\nMihono: Same here, we're glad to have you!\r\nAkane: One last thing. With everything being reorganized, your investigation team has been officially designated [YOUR TEAM NAME HERE]. I expect good results from you girls.\r\nAkane: That's all, you're dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: Yui's Excuse\r\n\r\nHana: Really, I can't believe you... You think you can get out of letting Kofuki-san nearly cut my head off with just \"Teehee!\"?\r\nYui: You don't have to blame me for it~. I didn't even know that I was supposed to tell them about you on that mission.\r\nHana: You didn't know!?\r\nYui: I mean, back when Aoto Youji-san told me everything, all he said was \"there's another person who'll be helping you out\" right at the end.\r\nYui: So all I was thinking is there's somebody else to look out for.\r\nYui: Since he didn't make a big deal out of it, I figured everybody else already knew.\r\nHana: Ahh... Since it's that guy, I can believe it...\r\nYui: See? And it happened so long ago, so just forget about it, forget about it. Now I have to go talk to Mirja-san, it's almost time. This is an important mission too.\r\nYui: Nnn~, I get to have Mirja-san all to myself on this mission. Could I get any luckier-!\r\nHana: Hey, wait... You're forgetting me again. It's the three of us going together, remember!?\r\nYui: Ah, really? Teehee!\r\nHana: Stop saying \"Teehee\"! You're impossible..."}, {"paste_key": "UkBG3mM8", "title": "3-2 The Dark Shadow Working Behind the Scenes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/UkBG3mM8", "timestamp": "", "hits": "123", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5g6KSmsL_o\r\n\r\n1: Unease (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: Hey, Chii-nee. Do you know where Yui is?\r\nChie: I haven't seen her today. Did you need her for something?\r\nMihono: Not really. It's just, it's been all quiet this morning, so I was wondering if she's in some kind of trouble.\r\nChie: That's true. Normally by this time you'd be hearing the shrieks of girls Yui-chan went after, but it is awfully quiet today.\r\nMihono: Right? If Yui's not going around sniffing girls as they wake up, then something has to have gone wrong!\r\nChie: I think something's gone wrong if she's doing that in the first place, but... It probably is worth looking into.\r\nMihono: I went to her room, but she's not there.\r\nKiyoka: Ah, have you two seen Hana-san?\r\nMihono: I don't think I've seen her today.\r\nChie: Me neither.\r\nKiyoka: Everyone else is saying the same thing. I wonder where she went.\r\nKofuki: Oi, you seen Mirja around? I've been trying to find her, but she's nowhere.\r\nChie: Mirja-san too? I wonder why all three from Ayanokouji are the ones missing.\r\nAnnouncement: Aradama have appeared, aradama have appeared, the location is--\r\nChie: We should go deal with that. There's a good chance we'll run into those three when we get there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Unease (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Mirja-san and them never showed up, huh.\r\nKofuki: They're probably slacking off somewhere. Taking their paycheck while we do all the work. Well, with them not around I get more aradama-chan to play with.\r\nKiyoka: Still, where could they have gone?\r\nAkane: Early this morning, all Ayanokouji toji were called back to Ayanokouji.\r\nChie: Akane-sama, every one of them was called back? Why would they do that?\r\nAkane: Even I'm not sure of their reasoning. The decision was made secretly within Ayanokouji. I wasn't aware of it myself until just now.\r\nChie: You mean President Souraku is taking things into her own hands?\r\nKofuki: What's going on here? Isn't Akane-sama the big boss? Are you going to let her get away with that?\r\nAkane: I'm ashamed to admit this, but ever since my sister went into hiding, the chain of command in the Five Traditions hasn't been functioning properly.\r\nAkane: But, at a time like this... I can't imagine what she's thinking.\r\nKofuki: I don't like it. It's got bad news written all over.\r\nKiyoka: It feels that way, but... I hope it's nothing.\r\nChie: I am worried about it, but for Mirja-san and the others to go along, they must have something in mind.\r\nChie: In which case, all we can do is wait for them to get back.\r\nMihono: That's right. It might be tough with just the four of us for a while, but we'll do our best while they're away.\r\nKofuki: I'll cut up their share of aradama-chan for them while they're gone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Chasing After the One You Admire (1)\r\n\r\nUchizato Ayumu: Ei! Yah! Sa!\r\nTanabe Miya: Why not take a break? You've been pushing yourself so hard lately, Ayumu.\r\nAyumu: That's because I made a promise with Etou-san! That one day, I'd fight alongside her!\r\nMiya: Etou-san? Ahh, you mean Etou Kanami-san.\r\nAyumu: Right now, I'm nothing compared to Etou-san, so I have to train a whole lot more if I want to get stronger!\r\nMiya: You really look up to Etou-san, don't you?\r\nAyumu: Yeah!\r\nMiya: She was so strong, wasn't she? But we were pretty useless in comparison.\r\nMiya: If Etou-san hadn't been there to save us, who knows what would have happened... I don't want to think about it.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks earlier--\r\nDuring an aradama suppression mission.\r\n\r\nUnit Leader: After the firing squad stops, we'll rush in! Match each other's timing! If you do it like in training, you'll make it through!\r\nAyumu: Pant... Pant...!\r\nAradama: GYAAAUUUUUU!\r\nUnit Leader: Here they come, draw your swords!\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nAyumu: KYAAAAAA!!\r\nUnit Leader: Uchizato-!?\r\nAyumu: Even though I got an okatana... My utsushi is gone just like that...\r\nAyumu: Pant... Pant... I can't do anything... Against something this strong...\r\nAyumu: It's no use, it's going to... It's going to get me... I'm scared...\r\nUnit Leader: All toji, provide cover for Uchizato! Move i\u30fc\u30fc\r\nAradama: GYAAUUUUN!\r\nAyumu: Wh-What was that!?\r\nKanami: Sayaka-chan, let's do this!\r\nSayaka: Right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Chasing After the One You Admire (2)\r\n\r\nAyumu: A-Amazing... It's so one sided... Even with all of us together, we couldn't do anything, but...\r\nAyumu: Especially Etou-san... The aradama can't even come close to her... And her swordsmanship too... I had no idea someone could fight like that. She's so amazing...\r\nKanami: You're doing great, Sayaka-chan!\r\nSayaka: You would be fine even if I weren't here, Kanami.\r\nKanami: Huh? That's not true.\r\nSayaka: If we fought seriously, I don't think I'd be able to land a hit on you. That's the difference between us.\r\nKanami: That's not...\r\nSayaka: You should know, Kanami. You're the only one in a distant place.\r\nKanami: .........\r\nUnit Leader: Thank you for the assistance, you two. We'll handle processing the aftermath.\r\nKanami: Okay, please do.\r\n\r\nAyumu: She said Etou-san was all alone in a distant place...\r\nAyumu: I couldn't do anything back then, but next time will be different. I'll be able to fight properly then!\r\nAyumu: I just have to get stronger! I want to get stronger, so I can become a useful toji like Etou-san!\r\nMirja: It's good to see you so dedicated to your practice, but did you not hear the announcement?\r\nMirja: They asked for all interview applicants to head to the President's room. Please get yourself ready and head there at once.\r\nMiya: That was Kitora-senpai just now, wasn't it? She left already...\r\nMiya: Ah, more importantly, you're one of those interview applicants, aren't you, Ayumu? If you don't move fast you'll get yelled at.\r\nAyumu: R-Right!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Interview\r\n\r\nHana: Thank you very much for the interview. Then, if you'll excuse me!\r\nYuzuki: Suzumoto Hana... Her noro compatibility is high, and she hopes to join the imperial guard. It's hard to ask for a more ideal subject.\r\nYuzuki: But, considering her involvement as a spy for Mokusa, I have no option but to disqualify her.\r\nYuzuki: Now then-- Next applicant, enter!\r\nYui: Excuse me. I'm Yamashiro Yui, second year in middle school.\r\nYuzuki: This may be sudden, but let's cut to the heart of the matter. You strongly wish to join the imperial guard, don't you?\r\nYui: Yes, I was told they earn a much larger salary!\r\nYuzuki: Do you need that much for your sister's medical expenses?\r\nYui: ......!!\r\nYuzuki: What are you surprised about? As a candidate for the imperial guard, you should expect I'd perform a background check on you.\r\nYuzuki: Or is it a subject you didn't want to be brought up? If that's the case, then I apologize.\r\nYui: N-No... It's fine... I was just taken a little off guard.\r\nYui: If you already know my situation, then that makes this easier. I need money for my sister.\r\nYui: So please, let me join the imperial guard! I promise I'll work to earn that money. No, I can work no matter how hard you need me to!\r\nYuzuki: It's good to see you're so motivated. On top of which, you do have high compatibility with noro.\r\nYui: High compatibility with noro? What are you talking about?\r\nYuzuki: One of the conditions of joining the imperial guard is to accept injections of noro into your body.\r\nYui: But... Injecting noro into yourself... That's dangerous, isn't it!?\r\nYuzuki: That's right... You're aware of the circumstances involving Tsubakuro Yume, aren't you? No, you should know the others in the elite guard as well. Of course you'd feel apprehensive.\r\nYuzuki: However, the strengthening drugs you'll be administered are the latest formula. Compared to the previous formula, the risks are far lower.\r\nYui: Lower? That means there's still a risk, doesn't it?\r\nYuzuki: It does. I want you to consider this offer understanding that. If you find it unreasonable, then I won't blame you for withdrawing your application.\r\nYui: ............I'll withdraw.\r\nYui: I do need the money, but if anything happened to me, then Miku-- Then my sister wouldn't be able to pay for her treatment.\r\nYuzuki: I see... Then you may leave.\r\nYui: Thank you.\r\n\r\nYuzuki: Sigh... Uchizato Ayumu and Kitora Mirja are the only ones left?\r\nYuzuki: It goes without saying, but to have made it this far they each have high compatibility with noro.\r\nYuzuki: Regardless of who I chose, they would become an excellent Myouga toji.\r\nYuzuki: But... I can't allow these girls to get involved in this.\r\nYuzuki: As their president, this is the least I can do for them. Yukina will be upset, I'm sure...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Escape (1)\r\n\r\nAt Ayanokouji Martial Arts School, several hours after President Souraku Yuzuki's imperial guard selection interviews had concluded--\r\n\r\nMirja: The president has been behaving strangely, so I did some investigating of my own. But I never thought she'd go as far as forming a guard to protect Tagitsuhime.\r\nYui: Eh, Tagitsuhime!? I never heard anything like that!\r\nMirja: Of course, it was beyond all my expectations as well. I returned to see why she recalled everyone so urgently, but... I never imagined it would end up like this.\r\nMirja: I trust the two of you have no interest in joining her guard either?\r\nYui: No way, no way! I told her no right away. There's no way I'm letting them put noro in me!\r\nHana: I failed the interview anyway. I have no idea what I did wrong.\r\nYui: So then, Mirja-san...\r\nMirja: I refused her, saying I wanted to continue with the investigation team.\r\nHana: So, Mirja-senpai, what are we doing next?\r\nMirja: We'll get away from here as soon as possible and report this to the investigation team. With things as they are, we can't afford to stay any longer.\r\nMirja: Every moment that passes is a disadvantage for us.\r\nMirja: As members of the investigation team, if we were to suddenly disappear, it's highly likely someone would come after us.\r\nHana: In that case, we'll just have to force our way through, won't we...\r\nMirja: It would be best not to move so conspicuously. We should split up from here.\r\nYui: Got it! Then, I'll see you two on the other side. There's a big hug waiting for you next time we meet!\r\nHana: Honestly, you just don't quit, do you? ...Be sure you make it back, Yui.\r\nMirja: Then, until this is over.\r\n\r\nSeveral more hours later, with Kitora Mirja--\r\n\r\nMirja: I knew we would be followed, but I hardly expected to see you.\r\nMirja: Third seat of the elite guard, Satsuki Yomi.\r\nYomi: You're going to become a Myouga toji.\r\nMirja: Myouga toji? Is that what you're calling toji strengthened by noro? I've already refused that offer.\r\nYomi: Your wishes don't matter here. You'll become a pawn for her.\r\nMirja: I'll say it again. I refuse.\r\nYomi: If I wound you badly enough here, even if you dislike it, you'll accept the noro to save your own life. The same as the other toji did.\r\nMirja: You... You attacked other toji like that!?\r\nYomi: Is there a problem?\r\nMirja: How could you...!\r\nYomi: There's no need to speak any longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Escape (2)\r\n\r\nMirja: Pant, pant... I'd expect nothing less, from the elite guard. Still, I somehow seem to have driven her off...\r\nMirja: I need to report this, as soon as possible... That something terrible is happening...\r\nMirja: Kh... I have to make it... Back to everyone...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Unshakeable Doubt (1)\r\n\r\nChie: ...She's still not answering.\r\nChie: In the week since Mirja-san and the others went back to Ayanokouji, I haven't been able to get through to them once... I just hope nothing went wrong.\r\nKofuki: Like what? It's totally normal to go a week without talking to someone.\r\nKofuki: You worry about everything, Chichie. Think about it, maybe they're on an assignment out somewhere and their phones ran out of battery?\r\nChie: ...I'm sorry. I can't help but think back to when Mokusa was attacked...\r\nKofuki: This is nothing like that though. They just went back home to their school. Who'd even be attacking them?\r\nKofuki: Besides, you just know anyone trying to break in there is gonna have a way worse time.\r\nKiyoka: They say that no news is good news. I'm sure everyone is doing fine.\r\nMihono: Yeah, I mean, it's Mirja-san we're talking about. She wouldn't let anything go wrong that easy.\r\nChie: You're right. It's not as if anything's actually happened, so I shouldn't be thinking so negatively.\r\nKofuki: When it comes down to it, I just wish the people making decisions around here would get it together.\r\nKofuki: I don't care if they're showing off or looking to grab some power. What're people doing fighting between each other now?\r\nMihono: Whoa, Fukki said something sensible for once!\r\nKofuki: Alright Mihocchi, stick your ass out for me so I can kick it.\r\nChie: It's just like Kofuki-chan said. With the threat that Tagitsuhime poses, we all need to work together...\r\nChie: And I of all people...\r\nMihono: Chii-nee...\r\nAnnouncement: Aradama have appeared, aradama have appeared, the location is--\r\nChie: Let's go, everyone. There's something for us that needs to be done.\r\nKofuki: Alright-! I'll love you to my heart's content, my aradama-chan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: Unshakeable Doubt (2)\r\n\r\nKofuki: Phew, that feels way better! Nothing beats playing with aradama-chan after all. Best to keep things simple, just kill or be killed.\r\nMihono: But still, you keep running off on your own, Fukki.\r\nKofuki: Why're you whining about that now? You know that's how I play.\r\nKiyoka: I already know the answer, but you don't care at all to work on that, do you?\r\nKofuki: If you know already, then just give it up.\r\nAnnouncement: Will the investigation team please assemble in the briefing room at once. I repeat--\r\nKiyoka: That's awfully quick after we just got back. What could they want?\r\nChie: We'll know when we get there. Come on, let's go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: A Return Full of Wounds\r\n\r\nSana: First off, good work. Thanks to your investigation team's efforts, we've managed to keep casualties to a minimum. I couldn't ask for much more out of you.\r\nKofuki: You've got me around, of course it's like that.\r\nSana: Hmm? Someone's feeling cocky. If you've got that kind of energy to spare, I was worried for nothing. Time for your next mission.\r\nKofuki: Oh! Sounds good! So long as I get to mess with more aradama-chan, then keep it coming!\r\nSana: Huh, unlike a certain other chihuahua you seem plenty motivated. Though, sorry to get your hopes up, but this one isn't about aradama suppression.\r\nKofuki: What, then what's the point!? Where am I supposed to unload all this motivation!?\r\nChie: What is this mission about then?\r\nSana: You're being sent to the Ministry of Defense, to safeguard Takirihime. With the situation as it is, it wouldn't be unusual if Tagitsuhime attacked any day now. We can never have enough people over there.\r\nSana: If Takirihime ends up merging with Tagitsuhime, we'd be lucky to get off as easy as we did with the disaster twenty years ago.\r\nMihono: Umm, but, can we really trust Takirihime either? She used to be a part of Tagitsuhime, didn't she?\r\nSana: Asakura's concern is reasonable, but at the very least, she doesn't seem to have any ill will towards humanity.\r\nSana: Tagitsuhime plans on eradicating humanity, while Ichikishima wants to create a new world through the unification of humanity and aradama.\r\nSana: And Takirihime offers to guide humanity through coexistence.\r\nKofuki: Guide makes it sound nice and all, but what she really means is she'll dominate us, right? At the end of the day we'd just be like farm animals.\r\nSana: Even still, there's room for debate with her. Which is why we can't allow the three goddesses to fuse together again under any circumstances.\r\nSana: While they're split into three, if we can manage to defeat Tagitsuhime, we'd like to negotiate with the other two to find a less aggressive solution.\r\nMihono: I think I get it.\r\nSana: Akane-sama already headed over there wtih Etou and Juujou. You four will follow after them.\r\nMirja: I've made it... Back...\r\nMihono: M-Mirja-san!? Wait... She's bleeding everywhere... We have to get her some first aid quick!\r\nKiyoka: These wounds are terrible... Were you fighting an aradama...?\r\nKofuki: No, that's not it. An aradama didn't do this. Look, this is a cut from a sword.\r\nMihono: A sword... Huh? How did... What happened!?\r\nMihono: If Mirja-san's injured this badly... Then who did it? You mean... Tagitsuhime!?\r\nChie: Calm down, Mihono-chan. What matters most is that we take care of Mirja-san right now.\r\nMirja: It isn't as bad, as it looks. I can receive medical treatment later. Before that, I have to make my report right away.\r\nSana: ...Then you can tell us while you're getting treated.\r\nMirja: Un... derstood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther: Mirja's Condition\r\n\r\nSana: Kitora Mirja's condition... It's concerning, you know.\r\nChie: I thought so. Just from looking at her, she seems seriously injured...\r\nSana: If things are as bad as they seem... Chie. You may need to assume the role of commanding your team for the time being. Keep that in mind.\r\nChie: I-I understand...\r\nMihono: Director Maniwa! Apparently Mirja-san's wounds aren't actually that deep. They said she can join in the meeting later too!\r\nSana: Well that's a relief. But still, sending her back to work is another issue entirely. I should go talk to her a little...\r\nChie: Sigh... It's not just Mirja-san. I'm worried about Yui-chan and Hana-chan too. We haven't heard any reports of them showing up yet.\r\nMihono: I'm sure they'll be fine! You worry too much, Chii-nee! Come on, let's all go check in on Mirja-san! Okay?\r\nChie: Mirja-san, Yui-chan, Hana-chan... Just what happened out there..."}, {"paste_key": "abmKim2a", "title": "Pair vs Pair!

New Year's Karuta Competition\r\n\r\nHiyori: It feels a lot more empty than usual around here. \r\nKanami: Well, everyone who isn't on duty over New Year's break started going back home.\r\nHiyori: Oh, so it's that time already?\r\nKanami: That reminds me, Hiyori-chan, did you see the poster on the bulletin board?\r\nHiyori: Did something happen?\r\nKanami: For New Year's, the Origami family is sponsoring a karuta competition! Do you want to sign up for it with me?\r\nHiyori: Sorry, but I don't have time to spend the start of the year playing a game for kids. If you want to sign up, Kanami, you should do it yourself.\r\nKanami: But you see, the thing about this competition is, you have to sign up in pairs to participate. So please, Hiyori-chan! Help me out!\r\nHiyori: Why do you want to join in this competition so badly anyway?\r\nKanami: Haven't you heard, Hiyori-chan? The karuta legend about the Origami family.\r\nHiyori: Nn? What's that supposed to mean?\r\nKanami: It's about the karuta cards they only use in the final match. This legend's been passed down for a reaaaally long time.\r\nKanami: Whoever wins using those karuta cards will go on to prove themselves as the strongest toji that year!\r\nHiyori: Whoever wins in the finals... So you're saying, the title of strongest toji only goes to the winning pair?\r\nKanami: That's right! And what better way to start off the year than by winning that title? So let's enter together! Come on!\r\nHiyori: This all sounds stupid. That's just a meaningless rumor.\r\nKanami: Nnnn, then how about this! If we win together, I'll use my New Year's money to buy you a whole lot of chocolate mint ice cream!\r\nHiyori: You'll do what...?\r\nHiyori: Well, if you're willing to go that far, I'll join you.\r\nKanami: Yesss-! You're always reliable, Hiyori-chan. I knew that would make you come around!\r\nHiyori: I-It's not like I'm doing this for chocolate mint, okay.\r\nHiyori: Because we're stuck here on standby duty over the holiday, I can tell we're going to be spending a lot of time together...\r\nHiyori: And, since Mai and Sayaka both left, I figured there's no one besides me you would be able to pair up with...\r\nKanami: Well, so long as you made up your mind, let's go fill out our entry right now!\r\nHiyori: Hey, Kanami! Don't leave me behind like that.\r\n\r\nHiyori: The competition was cancelled!? Why would they do that?\r\nOrganizer: It hasn't been decided yet, but... Some of the prized cards that were going to be used in the finals were taken by aradama.\r\nOrganizer: It's tradition to use those cards in the competition, so the decision was made that it has to be cancelled if they can't be recovered before the end of the year...\r\nKanami: I can't believe this...\r\nHiyori: Alright, Kanami. Let's get those cards back from the aradama!\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan! That's it! That's all we have to do.\r\nOrganizer: You'll lend a hand? That would be a big help.\r\nKanami: Look at you, Hiyori-chan, getting all motivated! That chocolate mint really did the trick, huh?\r\nHiyori: W-Will you just drop that already... You've got it all wrong.\r\nHiyori: You did a lot for me this year, so I thought that, at least for New Year's, it wouldn't be so bad to do what you want.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan! I'm really glad to hear it~. If that's how you feel, let's win this thing for sure!\r\nHiyori: Right. And to make that happen, we need to kill those aradama first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Elite Guard's End of the Year\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Phew, with this, all my desk work that needed finishing before the year's end is complete. Done at last. How are you handling things, Yomi-san, Maki-san?\r\nYomi: I finished this year's duties yesterday, so I've started on next year's in advance.\r\nMaki: I also finished not long ago, so I began getting things ready for New Year's.\r\nSuzuka: Oh, Maki-san, are you not returning home this year?\r\nMaki: I'm not. I'll stay behind again this time, so you two can return home with no worries.\r\nSuzuka: Our work in the elite guard isn't affected by Obon or New Year's. Additionally, there is an important duty we need to fulfill together at the beginning of the year, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: What duty? Did Yukari-sama give some kind of order?\r\nSuzuka: That's not what I meant. Have you already forgotten the promise you made me at the start of this year?\r\nSuzuka: You said we would win the karuta tournament together again this time.\r\nMaki: Oh, that's all. But that's also an important event for us. We'll have to work hard to get our second consecutive victory.\r\nSuzuka: And in doing so, I'll stay behind with you, Maki-san. Yomi, you can return to your hometown if you like.\r\nYomi: No, that won't be necessary. I had also intended to hold off from returning home through the end of the year...\r\nMaki: Are you sure? Your hometown is busy with its own traditional events, isn't it?\r\nSuzuka: If I recall, on the night of New Year's Eve, there's that thing with the scary face that goes around to all the houses... What was it again? Oh, the Namahage!\r\nYomi: Ahh...\r\nMaki: What's wrong, Yomi?\r\nSuzuka: Could it be you're afraid of the Namahage?\r\nYomi: No, it's nothing like that...\r\nYume: Hey, hey, onee-sans, did you hear? They might be cancelling the New Year's karuta competition!\r\nMaki: What? Yume, are you telling the truth?\r\nYume: It's true. The management onee-sans were just talking about it.\r\nYume: Since some aradama took the cards, if they can't find all of them, they said they can't do the competition.\r\nSuzuka: My, what rude aradama. Maki-san, for the sake of our second victory, why don't we recover those cards?\r\nMaki: Of course, straight away.\r\nYukari: All of you are here? Good. Konohana, Satsuki, I have a special New Year's mission to assign you. The two of you are to return to your hometowns and work to maintain public order.\r\nYomi: My hometown...\r\nYukari: There won't be an issue here with Shidou and Tsubakuro remaining on guard. You've all finished your standard business for the year, haven't you? Then get your things ready and depart for your assignment as soon as possible.\r\nSuzuka: (Could this be Yukari-sama's way of showing her gratitude, by allowing us to return to our homes? In that case, I can't exactly refuse her kindness.)\r\nSuzuka: Yomi, we should start preparing to leave right away.\r\nYomi: Yes...\r\nYomi: (I thought I would be able to avoid it this New Year's Eve, but if Yukari-sama orders me to go, I have no choice... Sigh...)\r\nMaki: I guess it's no use if a special mission came up. I'll have to sit out next year's karuta competition...\r\nYume: What are you talking about, Maki-onee-san? I'm here, you know? We can win it together!\r\nMaki: You'll compete with me, Yume?\r\nYume: If you win the karuta competition, you get a whole lot stronger, don't you? So of course I'm gonna win that!\r\nMaki: Then, on the first step toward our victory, let's recover the cards those aradama stole!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Investigation Team's End of the Year\r\n\r\nMirja: Thanks to all of your efforts, the mission to suppress aradama and recover the karuta cards has been successfully carried out.\r\nMirja: It's highly likely this will be our last assignment of the year. You've all worked very hard.\r\nKofuki: Tch, what a downer. I wanted to keep the love going with aradama-chan.\r\nYui: In that case, how about I could be your aradama-chan? Come on, Kofuki-san, dive right in!\r\nKofuki: Knock it off! Don't grab at me like that with all these people around-!\r\nYui: But it's so cold. Christmas is over, and New Year's is almost here. This is the number one season to find some human heat~.\r\nKiyoka: Still, I'm so glad we managed to safely finish our missions this year. It would be nice if we could go on like this through New Year's without anything happening.\r\nMihono: Yeah, I can't wait for the New Year's soba and stuff! But also, is that legend for real? The one where, whoever wins the karuta competition will become the strongest toji?\r\nChie: The winners this year were Shidou-san and Konohana-san of the elite guard, so it might be unexpectedly true.\r\nMihono: In that case, we've gotta win it! Though I don't really know how.\r\nMirja: In terms of vital skills to karuta, you need immediate reflexes and the intuition to guess at a card's contents from the first syllables said.\r\nKofuki: Hmm. Well, I don't care about anything that doesn't involve aradama-chan, so I'm not entering...\r\nMihono: It sounds like we just need to team up with Mirja-san to win then! I want to be with Mirja-san!\r\nKiyoka: Eh... I was going to offer being with her too though.\r\nYui: Hold it right there-! I'm the one who'll be in a couple with Mirja-san!\r\nChie: I think it's called a pair, not a couple... But when it comes to winning, I'd also like to pair with Mirja-san.\r\nKofuki: Well look who's popular, Mirja. What'll you do?\r\nMirja: I wouldn't want to cause needless conflict here at the end of the year. We should give everyone a fair chance and decide this by lottery.\r\nKiyoka: Lottery?\r\nMirja: In truth, there is one more skill necessary for karuta.\r\nMirja: That is, luck! Whether the cards will be placed in a favorable position when you need them is a matter of luck.\r\nChie: That makes sense. But, how are we going to do a lottery here?\r\nMirja: They have just the thing we need over there.\r\nKofuki: Wait, that's the shopping district's lottery!\r\nMirja: I have been steadily gathering lottery tickets, so this is a good opportunity. Whoever can draw the greatest prize and prove their luck will be the one I pair with.\r\nMihono: Sounds easy! Here goes nothing-!\r\nMihono: Ughh, 10 is a box of tissues. Don't tell me, I already had the worst luck and got the consolation prize...\r\nChie: I'll go next. Let's see.\r\nKofuki: 11! There was actually something worse than what Mihocchi got! ...Just a thing of pocket tissues. Ahh, that's a pretty normal consolation prize.\r\nKiyoka: Now I'll try! There!\r\nKiyoka: Yes! It's a different colored ball than the last two! I wonder what I got.\r\nKiyoka: Aw, it's a candy... Did I get the worst with a 12 then?\r\nYui: Looks like none of you have anything to show for yourselves, huh. Here's where I whip out a prize that'll put you all to shame!\r\nKofuki: Kiyoka, that's a flag right there. For sure she's gonna get something even worse than a candy now...\r\nYui: N-No waaay! A trip to Guam for two!!\r\nYui: I did it-! I'm going on an overseas vacation with Mirja-san!\r\nMirja: I didn't say I would go with you.\r\nYui: Ehhh, but this is the lottery I drew to become a couple with you, Mirja-san.\r\nMirja: What we decided had nothing to do with that.\r\nMirja: However, considering the results of the lottery, it's decided my partner will be Yamashiro Yui... In which case, our odds of victory seem hopeless.\r\nYui: That's not true at all! Since I already won the chance to couple up with Mirja-san, I'm going to win the whole thing for sure!\r\nYui: And to make that happen, I think we should give up our New Year's break and have one-on-one special training!\r\nMirja: One-on-one... I'm not sure I like the sound of that, but if we want to achieve overall victory, training will be essential...\r\nMirja: Very well. The two of us will train together thoroughly.\r\nYui: Hooray-! I'm spending New Year's alone together with Mirja-san! I'm the luckiest girl alive~!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: New Year's False Start \r\n\r\n--New Year's Eve.\r\n\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan, they said they got all the karuta cards back! Now they can hold the competition just fine.\r\nHiyori: They did? Well, besides us, there was the elite guard and everyone from the investigation team helping too.\r\nHiyori: If they confirmed they're holding it again, shouldn't we get right to training for it?\r\nKanami: Wow! You're super excited for this, aren't you, Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: I-I'm not just doing this for the chocolate mint either, okay? I just... I relied on you so much this year, so I thought I'd help you out over New Year's...\r\nKanami: And I'm glad to hear it! So first off, let's have a strategy meeting!\r\n\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chaaan, it's all set! Let's get right to it.\r\nHiyori: Wait, hang on. Why did we come out here to the cafeteria? And why is all this osechi laid out?\r\nKanami: Before Mai-chan went home, she made all this for us. And you know what they say, \"You can't fight on an empty stomach!\"\r\nHiyori: You aren't wrong, but, normally you eat osechi after the new year begins...\r\nKanami: Chew chew chew... Ahh, these simmered black soybeans are so good~! And these candied chestnuts with sweet potatoes too.\r\nHiyori: Mmg, you're just going to eat all this good looking food right before my eyes... Nnng...\r\nKanami: She went through all the effort of making it, so you should just eat it too, Hiyori-chan. Here, she simmered this how you like it and really brought the flavor out.\r\nHiyori: The flavor? I'll have to be the judge of that. Just one bite... Chew chew.\r\nHiyori: It's good! But it was made by Mai after all. Chew chew... Mm. This seaweed roll and fish paste omelette have an impressive flavor to them too.\r\nKanami: It's not so much New Year's related, but she made us some pudding for dessert too. Nn~, it's the best!\r\nHiyori: Ahh, it's so good! Still, if we eat too much here, then our New Year's soba...\r\nHiyori: Ah! No good... Kanami, check the time.\r\nKanami: Whoa, it's already 11pm! We got so caught up eating that we didn't make any progress on our strategy meeting, and now there's only an hour left in the year.\r\nHiyori: We were supposed to come up with a surefire plan before the end of the year, so we can start training as soon as the new year starts...\r\nKanami: I know! I've got a good idea. We can just pray for it. Let's do our first shrine visit at the shrine near here!\r\nHiyori: Our strategy for a surefire victory is prayer... Are you serious about this!?\r\nKanami: But isn't it your first shrine visit when that kind of thing is most effective?\r\nHiyori: Now that you mention it... Alright, we should leave now to help us walk off everything we just ate.\r\n\r\nKanami: Good thing there weren't that many people at the shrine~.\r\nHiyori: Right. Thanks to that, I was able to take my time praying for certain victory.\r\nKanami: Since both of us prayed a lot too, that means we'll win for sure!\r\nHiyori: Oh, the sound of that bell must mean...\r\nKanami: Dang. We were so focused on praying for victory that we must have shown up before the new year actually started!\r\nHiyori: In that case, the blessings we tried so hard to get might not have counted. Kanami, we should go back to the shrine again, just to be sure!\r\nKanami: Really, again? Is that our first shrine visit now?\r\nHiyori: Only your first visit after the new year begins counts. We have to head back right away!\r\nKanami: Okay! Since we went there twice, we might get double the blessings too!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Waiting on the Countdown\r\n\r\nMaki: Now that we've safely recovered all the karuta cards from aradama, our duties this year are fully complete.\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san, they're doing the countdown in one more hour! I'm a little tired, but we have to get the soba ready.\r\nYukari: Would you two like to join me? With this New Year's soba.\r\nYume: Thanks, Yukari-sama! I'm starving~.\r\nYume: Chew, chew... It's good~!\r\nMaki: Stop that, Yume! The new year hasn't begun yet.\r\nYukari: What's the harm in it? You should eat yours as well, before it gets cold.\r\nMaki: If you say so, Yukari-sama, then I'll gladly eat.\r\n\r\nYume: Phwaa, now that my belly's full I'm feeling even sleepier.\r\nMaki: You'd normally be long asleep by now, Yume. If you're that tired, there's no reason for you to stay up.\r\nYume: No way~. It's New Year's Eve and everything. I wanna do the countdown with Yukari-sama and Maki-onee-san!\r\nMaki: But if you stay up that late you'll feel exhausted tomorrow. Go on, get changed and go to your room.\r\nYume: Boo~, at least let me stay up for New Year's! I can, right, Yukari-sama?\r\nYukari: It only comes once a year. So long as you promise it won't affect your duties, you can do as you please.\r\nYume: Alright~! Yukari-sama, Maki-onee-san, if I fall asleep before the countdown, be sure to wake me up, okay?\r\nMaki: Right, don't worry... Hm? Yume?\r\nYume: (dozing off)...\r\nMaki: She's already falling asleep...\r\nMaki: Yume, wake up! You told us to keep you awake.\r\nYume: Wah-, Maki-onee-san. Thanks for getting me up.\r\nYume: I should find something to do to stay awake.\r\nMaki: In that case, the best thing would be exercise. Since the karuta competition is coming up, let's practice!\r\n\r\nMaki: There, the practice cards are all lined up. Yume, try taking one.\r\nYume: Mm, okay!\r\nYume: Eeeyh!\r\nYume: Look, look, Maki-onee-san! Did I get it right?\r\nMaki: Haha, if that's all you've got, you might as well give up on being champion. Here, I'll show you my method, so do your best to follow it. Like this.\r\nMaki: DYAAAAAAAAHH!!!!!!\r\nYume: G-Geh...\r\nYukari: Last time, when Shidou and Konohana won the championship match, it wasn't nearly so intense.\r\nMaki: There, Yume. Now you try.\r\nMaki: TAAAAAHH!! TEEEEEIH!!!\r\nYume: EEEEEEEYYH-! YAAAAAAHH--!!\r\n\r\nYume: Pant, pant... After Maki-onee-san's training, I feel wide awake now.\r\nYume: Ah, and the countdown's about to start!\r\nYume: Yukari-sama, Maki-onee-san, we have to get ready... Nn? Maki-onee-san?\r\nMaki: Zzzzz...\r\nYume: Hey, Maki-onee-san! What're you sleeping for!? Get up-!\r\nMaki: Zzzzz...\r\nYume: Geez, you shouldn't have gotten all worked up during practice. Wake up already, Maki-onee-san!\r\nYukari: Yume, give her this chance to rest.\r\nYume: Fine, then I won't wake Maki-onee-san up~...\r\nYume: I'll just have to do all my New Year's celebrating with you, Yukari-sama!\r\nYume: Yukari-sama! Here I comeee~!\r\nYukari: Fu, you still have a ways to go, Yume. You'll have to work hard this year.\r\nYume: Grrr... This year for sure, I'll become the strongest toji and beat you, Yukari-sama!\r\nYume: And that means we have to win that karuta competition for sure. Right, Maki-onee-san?\r\nMaki: Zzzzz...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Waiting on the First Sunrise\r\n\r\nYui: At last, it's just me and you, Mirja-san! Let me rephrase that! At last, we can be a couple together, Mirja-san!\r\nMirja: I'm not sure I approve of that rephrasing, but I suppose we should greet each other first. Happy New Year.\r\nMirja: As members of the same investigation team, and keeping a suitable distance from each other without crossing that line, I'll be in your care again this year.\r\nYui: Ahaha, I'll be in your care too! So then, why did you call me out here first thing at the start of the year, to this wonderfully tucked away room for?\r\nYui: Let me guess, you invited me to lay out the futon so we can share our first dream of the new year together?\r\nYui: I came here expecting that, so my heart and body have already been completely prepared! Now, where's that futon we need? In the closet~?\r\nMirja: I thought you might be like this, so I had all the bedding stored in the closet removed.\r\nMirja: It seems we've begun the new year with a great misunderstanding, but I didn't call you here for any such reason.\r\nYui: Then, I know! You wanted to start the year by confessing your love!\r\nMirja: For the sake of preserving my stamina, I won't respond to you any longer. The reason we switched to this room is out of consideration for our exercise and voices bothering other students in the dorm.\r\nMirja: Starting now, I will be giving you special training in karuta. You yourself proposed this sort of one-on-one guidance, so even if you complain, I will go hard on you.\r\nYui: W-W-Wow, hardcore one-on-one! Just the sound of that is giving me goosebumps!\r\nYui: I'm feeling inspired, getting so deeply involved right at the start of the year! Rough me up and wear me down, do whatever you want with me~.\r\nMirja: ...I see. In that case...\r\n\r\nYui: TEYAAAAH!!\r\nMirja: Too quiet! Lower your posture further and use your whole body to take it!\r\nYui: Okay! TORYAAAAAAHH!!!\r\nMirja: Still not enough! Never create a blind spot! Use both arms to blend in feints!\r\nYui: RIIIIIIIGHT!\r\n\r\nYui: Pant, pant... I can keep on going, Mirja-san!\r\nMirja: (How surprising. With it being so late into the night, and after all the uproar of New Year's, I expected her to have quickly given into exhaustion.)\r\nYui: Give me, the next one. Pant, pant...\r\nMirja: (To think Yamashiro Yui would manage to control her sexual harassment, and enthusiastically focus on this training.)\r\nMirja: With the coming of a new year, you've turned over a new leaf. That's a good attitude, Yamashiro Yui.\r\n\r\nYui: Pant, pant... Keep it coming... Huh? Mirja-san, look at that! The sun's already up.\r\nMirja: I was so engrossed in your training that I hardly noticed the time...\r\nYui: But we were able to greet the dawn together. What a romantic first sunrise date. We're no longer strangers to each other.\r\nYui: I worked my hardest staying up so I could share this moment with you, Mirja-san! Please give me some praise!\r\nMirja: Sigh, why must you always be like this... You mean to say you weren't doing it for our victory?\r\nYui: Of course there's that too. And when we win together, please go on a trip with me to Guam!\r\nMirja: I'll consider it.\r\nYui: Yesss-!\r\nMirja: I only said I would consider it. In any case, your training isn't done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: The New Year's Karuta Competition Opens!\r\n\r\n--On the day of the karuta competition.\r\n\r\nReferee: The winner of this semi-final match is the Etou Kanami, Juujou Hiyori pair!\r\nKanami: Alright! We did it, Hiyori-chan! We're going on to the finals-!\r\nHiyori: I know. Finally, we'll get to play using those famous karuta cards.\r\nMirja: Etou Kanami, Juujou Hiyori, congratulations. We may have been eliminated here, but it was a great honor having such a fine match against you.\r\nYui: Me and Mirja-san are gonna work hard in the deciding match for 3rd, so you'd better not lose in the finals either, Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan!\r\nKanami: Thanks! Let's all do our best till the end.\r\nLocal Intercom: Regarding the Kitora, Yamashiro pair that is set to play in the 3rd rank deciding match, after some consultation between the referee and committee of organizers, we have decided to invalidate all their victories up until this point.\r\nYui: Ehh-!? What's that for!?\r\nMirja: What's the meaning of this? Referee, I demand a reasonable explanation.\r\nReferee: Actually... We've received complaints from every student who you've played against so far.\r\nMirja: Complaints? I can't imagine what about. Would you tell us the nature of their complaints?\r\nReferee: While competing for a card, when Yamashiro-san's hand would meet the hand of a member from the opposing team, she would playfully stroke their hand while grinning at them. Those filing complaints said it made them too afraid to focus on the match...\r\nMirja: I saw nothing like that! But while concentrating on the match, I didn't think to look out for it either. Yamashiro Yui, are they telling the truth?\r\nYui: I'm not really sure... I mean, when you put a cute girl in front of me, I can't really remember what happens next. Ahaha.\r\nMirja: Referee, if you can't provide hard evidence of these accusations, I won't accept your decision to disqualify us.\r\nReferee: I thought you might feel that way, so I've prepared video evidence of your matches. I'll play them back now, so watch carefully.\r\nYui: TEEEEEEIII! Woww~, such pretty fingers! So pale and glossy... (Rub rub)... Nnn~ They feel so nice!\r\nYui: Ahaha, I actually did it! I don't remember it, so it must have happened subconsciously, but it looks like I really did it, huh~.\r\nMirja: I'm deeply sorry about this. I would like to apologize later to all the people who were caused trouble. Of course, I'll do it myself...\r\nMirja: Etou Kanami, Juujou Hiyori, please accept my apology for everything our pervert has done.\r\nHiyori: Wait, hang on. She never touched us. Right, Kanami?\r\nKanami: I think. But I was so focused on the match that I might not have noticed...\r\nYui: That's wrong~ I clearly remember our match. Both of you were moving so fast that I never got a chance to touch you. It was really frustrating, so please have another match against me later!\r\nMirja: You seem to be showing no shame for your actions... Yamashiro Yui, to prevent you from making this situation any worse, I'm pulling you out of here at once.\r\nYui: Ehhh~! Please hang on~, Mirja-saaan!\r\nHiyori: They left...\r\nKanami: Oh, Hiyori-chan, they're bringing out the cards for the final match! Who're we up against in the finals again?\r\nYume: Ehh~, it's the finals already? Everyone's so weak~.\r\nMaki: No, our opponents were all veteran players, but you've managed to become so much stronger in such a short time, Yume. Be sure not to let your guard down in the finals.\r\nYume: Okayyy~. Whoa, our opponents are those onee-sans?\r\nKanami: Tsubakuro-san and Shidou-san! If we win this match, it really feels like we'll be the strongest toji! Let's give it our best shot, Hiyori-chan.\r\nHiyori: Of course. We came this far, so of course we'll win.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: The Championship Goes to...?\r\n\r\nMaki: TAAAAAH!!!\r\nHiyori: Like I'll let you! TORYAAAAAAA---!!!\r\nMirja: Such incredible speed. Both parties are moving so fast I can no longer see their fingers.\r\nKanami: SERYAAAAA!!!!\r\nYume: TEEEEI!!!\r\nMirja: It's been an equal competition so far, and they're already at the final card...\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan, if we take that, we're the winners!\r\nHiyori: I know. I'm not about to lose here...\r\nMaki: DEEEEEI!!!\r\nHiyori: Kh, I started slow... But I won't lose...\r\nHiyori: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!\r\nHiyori: Ah... I got it! I got it, Kanami!\r\nYui: Whoa, they were moving so fast I missed everything, but it looks like Hiyori got it.\r\nMaki: Referee, I have an objection to make. Just now, Juujou Hiyori used third stage jin'i to take the final card. Is that a violation of the rules?\r\nHiyori: Ah... I can't believe myself. I wore Kogarasumaru to keep myself calm, but I must have unconsciously activated third stage jin'i...\r\nMirja: She could have desired so strongly to move quickly that her okatana responded and entered third stage jin'i for her...\r\nHiyori: Even if it wasn't intentional, I broke the rules by using my okatana's power. I'm sorry, Kanami. I made us lose.\r\nMaki: Hang on. No matter what the reasoning, in a contest, we should obey the call of the referee. Referee, was there a rule violated in this case?\r\nReferee: After some deliberation, in regards to the use of third stage jin'i... There is no regulation against it in this competition, so it will be recognized as a valid tactic. Therefore, the pair of Juujou Hiyori and Etou Kanami are the victors!\r\nYume: Ehh, no fair, nobody told me we could use our okatana.\r\nMaki: Wait, Yume. It was our mistake not carefully examining the rules of this competition. In order to win, we should have prepared our tactics better. \r\nMaki: This year we'll need to knuckle down and focus on our duties. It was nice to have learned that lesson at the start of the year. Congratulations on your victory, you two. This is your win.\r\nKanami: E-Ehh, but... Is it really okay if we win like that?\r\nYukari: It's as Shidou told you. To make full use of your capabilities on the battlefield, you must work out a thorough strategy. That's the natural order in the world of competition.\r\nHiyori: But I didn't plan on doing that...\r\nKanami: So wait, that means, we're the winners... That means we'll be the strongest toji!?\r\nYukari: There's a fair amount of evidence behind that old legend. It would be good of you to continue disciplining yourselves with that intent in mind.\r\nYukari: Now then, to the two of you champions, I will grant you a special prize on behalf of the Origami family.\r\nKanami: A prize!?\r\nHiyori: Wait, we don't need anything like that. The legend was enough for us.\r\nYukari: You shouldn't act so reserved. Go ahead and open this box.\r\nKanami: Wow-, it's full of gorgeous furisode! [Furisode are formal long-sleeved kimono]\r\nMirja: These are...! Each of them is exceptionally valuable one-of-a-kind quality.\r\nHiyori: We can't take something that special...\r\nYukari: I told you not to act reserved. You may take as many as you like. There's no reason for you to complain, is there?\r\nKanami: Yukari-sama... Ah, if that's what you're offering, then! This one, and this one, that one, this one, and can I take that one too?\r\nYui: I didn't think you were such a crafty girl, Kanami-chan~. I found a new side of you!\r\nKanami: That's not it. Here, This one is for you, Yui-chan, and this one's for Kitora-san.\r\nKanami: And then, here you go, Shidou-san and Tsubakuro-san.\r\nMaki: For us as well? Why would you go that far?\r\nKanami: Well, forgetting about who won, we still had some great matches, didn't we? So I want to share the joy of it with all of you.\r\nKanami: Ah, oh yeah! Since we all have furisode now, why don't we all put them on and go do our first shrine visit together?\r\nHiyori: Though for us it's our second... No, third visit... Still, that's not a bad idea.\r\nYume: It'll be fun! Maki-onee-san, let's go!\r\nYui: Uhyaa-! Those girls' hands were one thing, but now I get to feast my eyes on everyone in furisode too!? This year's shaping up to be my happiest one yet!\r\nMirja: Leaving aside this pervert for a moment, having my first shrine visit in traditional Japanese dress is a tempting offer.\r\nMaki: Looks like this year is already starting busy.

The Great Fortune Slip Recovery Operation - Prologue\r\n\r\n--New Year's at the Asakura Shrine. For the Asakura family, the busiest time of year has arrived.\r\n\r\nMihono: Grandpa! Is it just me, or are there a ton more visitors than last year!?\r\nAsakura Yoshizumi: I know... I'm surprised too. Who'd have guessed it'd work so well.\r\nMihono: Eh, you know why they're all here!? The shrine's packed with people wanting fortune slips!\r\nYoshizumi: You see, a friend of mine's a writer. He asked me if he could use our shrine as a location in his latest novel.\r\nYoshizumi: It went on sale not too long ago, and won some kind of big award. And now it's a hit that sold over a million copies.\r\nYoshizumi: In the story, the protagonist pays the Asakura Shrine a visit, and after he draws a fortune slip here, he starts turning his life around... So it's thanks to that that we're so popular this year.\r\nMihono: I get one of our slips every year, so my life should be turning around all the time!!\r\nMihono: Sorry, Chii-nee... I called you over to mess around, but we got dragged into helping out with the shrine.\r\nChie: Fufu, don't worry about me. It's a good sign for the start of the year, don't you think?\r\nChie: More importantly, if you don't refill the fortune slips you'll run out soon, won't you?\r\nMihono: You're right! And the waiting line's still so long too... I'll go grab some real fast!\r\nChie: Please do.\r\n\r\nMihono: Umm, I think we kept the fortune slips in the room out back... Nn? ...Ehhh!?\r\nAradama: GYAAAAAAAAA!\r\nMihono: Why'd an aradama have to show up now!? Wait, it's getting into the bag of fortune slips!\r\nMihono: Just...\r\nMihono: Give that back-!!\r\nAradama: gyaaa...\r\nMihono: Pant, pant... I got it, but... It feels like there's way less in here than there used to be...!\r\nMihono: Ah, Yui? What's up?\r\nYui: You're never going to believe this! I'm out on a walk with Kiyoka-chan right now, and we ran into an aradama, and I beat it, but, that aradama had a fortune slip for some reason. And it was a great blessing too~!\r\nYui: I'm so lucky~, it sounds like this year I'll be getting way closer with Kiyoka-chan~.\r\nMihono: THAT'S... THAT'S MY FORTUNE SLIIIIP~!!\r\nYui: I get why you'd be jealous~! You want it too, don't you! A blessing with Kiyoka-chan! But, there's nothing you could do to make me hand this over, Mihono-chan...\r\nYui: Ah, wait... If you're willing to do anything, then...! If you just do one little favor for me, I might think about letting you have this blessing, you know?\r\nYui: So? What'll it be~? Fu~ Fu~ Fu~\r\nMihono: No, that's not what I meant! That fortune slip came from here at the Asakura Shrine, and these aradama came and stole them!\r\nYui: Ehh!?\r\nMihono: Please, Yui! There might be other aradama with those fortune slips around where you are, so could you beat them and bring them back here?\r\nMihono: I'll head over there too! And I'll give you a reward for helping me out!\r\nYui: Hey now, Mihono-chan. We're closer than that, aren't we~! As soon as you asked, my answer was already OK!\r\nYui: Me and Kiyoka-chan are wearing furisode right now, so it's honestly hard for us to fight, but we'll do what we can to help!\r\nMihono: Thanks so much-!! I'll be right over, okay!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: For Better Fortune! The Great Fortune Slip Recovery Operation - Epilogue\r\n\r\nMihono: DYAAAAAA!!\r\nYui: ORRYAA!\r\nKiyoka: E-Eii-!\r\nMihono: Phew... I think we've gotten most of them back by now. It took a while, so I hope things are okay back at the shrine...\r\nYui: Wow, I got another great blessing, Kiyoka-chan! I think this is gonna be a great year for me!\r\nKiyoka: Hey, Yui-chan, stop opening those! We're on a mission to recover them!\r\nYui: Ah... Oh yeah, whoopsie.\r\nMihono: I'm so sorry I made you two help me out on your day off! You really saved my butt here, so thanks!\r\nYui: We're friends; don't sweat it! More importantly, when are you giving me that reward of yours, Mihono-chan~? After you teased me with it, I just can't calm down.\r\nMihono: Oh right, your reward! Come on back to the shrine with me, you two!\r\nYui: Eh, what's that mean? Is it something we can only do in a special situation? I'm getting even more excited~!!\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan... I don't think she'll do what you're imagining.\r\nYui: Are you sure? How exactly do you know what I'm imagining anyway? What were you imagining, Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKiyoka: Fwaah!?!? I-I don't know!!\r\nMihono: What are you two still standing around talking for? Chii-nee's waiting for us, so let's go-!\r\nYui: Okaaay~.\r\n\r\nMihono: Chii-nee, I'm really sorry I left you here for so long!\r\nChie: We were okay. Anyway, did you get the fortune slips back?\r\nMihono: Yui and Kiyoka helped out, so we managed to get a lot of them! Here you go, Grandpa.\r\nYoshizumi: Sorry to work you like that. We should be able to get enough to all the visitors waiting now.\r\nKiyoka: Isn't that great, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Yeah! Oh, these are for you, Yui, Kiyoka, Chii-nee!\r\nYui: Thanks! Ooh, a hagoita! And it's painted all cute too! [Hagoita are paddles used in hanetsuki, which is like badminton]\r\nMihono: Yeah, our shrine makes hagoita! ...I suck at art though, so it's mostly Futaba and Sawano who did these. Ehehe.\r\nKiyoka: I've never played hanetsuki before, but I'd like to try!\r\nChie: In that case, why don't we all play together!\r\nMihono: Sounds good! Let's do it!\r\nYui: Alright-! Let's make a competition out of it! Winner gets Kiyoka-chan! I'm gonna go all out!!\r\nKiyoka: Eh-? EhhhhHHHHH!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: A Newcomer to the Investigation Team...?\r\n\r\nTsugumi: ...\r\nYui: Oh? I had a feeling that good looking girl over here was you, Tsugumi-san!\r\nTsugumi: Ah, Yamashiro-san. Hello, how are you?\r\nYui: I'm doing great! Anyway, why the long face?\r\nTsugumi: Hm? Did I look upset about something just now?\r\nYui: Yep, without a doubt! If something's bothering you, you're more than welcome to ask Yamashiro Yui for any advice!\r\nTsugumi: I hate to break it to you, but this is only my usual expression. People often tell me they can't read what I'm thinking.\r\nYui: They do...!? I'm sorry! You're one of those cool beauty types, after all, Tsugumi-san! That side of you still gets my heart racing!\r\nTsugumi: Thank you... Still, that's right.\r\nTsugumi: Can I ask one favor of you?\r\nYui: Sure thing, lay it on me. Whatever a cutie like you wants, I'll do anything to make it happen.\r\nTsugumi: To tell the truth, I'd like to try working together with your investigation team just once.\r\nYui: Huh? The investigation team?\r\nTsugumi: Yes. Lately, bit by bit, Shichinosato-san has been changing.\r\nTsugumi: She seems to have become more aware she can depend on those around her.\r\nYui: Uhh, that's a good thing though... Right?\r\nTsugumi: Of course, I find it positive growth.\r\nTsugumi: Being able to manage one's own affairs is a vital skill, but the ability to work as a group is equally essential. By adapting to what the situation asks, there's far more data at my disposal.\r\nYui: That's great! So, what's that mean?\r\nTsugumi: I've grown interested in the investigation team that's changing Shichinosato-san.\r\nYui: So basically, you want to know more about us, who have been dealing with Kofuki-san!\r\nYui: Well, I feel you! Name anything you want from me, Tsugumi-san!?\r\nTsugumi: Please calm down. I won't need any more than to analyze you when fighting.\r\nYui: Tsugumi-san's going to conduct a private analysis of me!? How can you expect me to calm down!\r\nYui: In that case, let's go see Mirja-san together!\r\nYui: If we tell her you want to come along with us, I'm sure she'll let us!\r\nTsugumi: Will it really go over that easily?\r\nYui: Probably! Our next mission's up in some snowy mountain, so we have to start getting you ready now!\r\nTsugumi: A snowy mountain? That would definitely require preparation. Let's go, Yamashiro-san.\r\nTsugumi: Since I'll be going with you, I can count on you to look after me, can't I?\r\nYui: You'll be the one watching after me, won't you! If all else fails, we can warm our naked bodies together!\r\nTsugumi: Fufu. I highly doubt something like that would happen, but I'm looking forward to our mission together."}, {"paste_key": "GPRPgDXD", "title": "Hit or Stand?

This is a school event, so you would cause the whole group to become disorganized.\r\nKofuki: I wasn't serious! What were you, on the student council in a past life, in the morals committee now, and shooting for class president in the next one!?\r\nKiyoka: That's rude, Kofuki-san! Though, I don't really understand what you're saying!?\r\nKofuki: It's not rude, you got it all wrong, Kiyoka. I'm just looking out for Mai.\r\nKofuki: If somebody doesn't say something, she's gonna turn into another Chichie.\r\nMai: But Chie-san is a wonderful person... Actually, I'd be glad to be more like her?\r\nKofuki: Hmm. Well you're already growing into the part, so you might as well act like it, huh.\r\nMai: Growing into...... Hey!? Where are you looking!!\r\nKofuki: Ahahahahaha!\r\nKofuki: But you know, I've gotta keep screwing around to put up with this. This dumbass game training.\r\nKofuki: We didn't do this last year, so whose bright idea was it this time?\r\nMai: I don't think it's as absurd as you're making it out to be.\r\nKofuki: Really? I mean, the whole Five Traditions made this game center, but it doesn't even have rhythm or fighting games? What're we doing there then?\r\nKiyoka: That's true... All it's meant to have are slot machines, roulette tables, and playing cards, right?\r\nKofuki: They think we're gonna play cards against aradama-chan or something?\r\nMai: When it comes to cards, it takes concentration to recognize a chance and take it, and good judgment to decide whether to call or draw. That might be what they want us improving...\r\nMai: With slot machines, they could improve our perception, and with the others, I'm sure there's a good reason they have these games for our training.\r\nKiyoka: Now that I think about it... Game training does sound like it could help a lot with being a toji, Kofuki-san.\r\nKofuki: But you're not gonna kill an aradama-chan with cards.\r\nKiyoka: ...Fufu, that's very like you.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: ...This place sure is huge.\r\nMai: I heard they built it specifically for this training, but... It certainly has the right atmosphere.\r\nKofuki: For sure.\r\nMaki: That's enough talking!\r\nSuzuka: The explanation of your game training is about to begin.\r\nMaki: First off, forget everything you imagined when you think of the word \"game\".\r\nMaki: This is toji training, as true as any other.\r\nMai: Will we be required to play all these games?\r\nSuzuka: That isn't the case.\r\nSuzuka: You can choose to play games for one person, or more competitive games. So long as you can win points.\r\nSuzuka: However, I will say this: competitive games will be much more efficient at that.\r\nMaki: Those who fail will face extra lessons, continuing their training until they've made up for all the points they couldn't collect.\r\nMaki: And afterwards, they'll be cleaning this facility.\r\nMai: (I wonder if they're already testing our judgment from the games we choose...)\r\nKiyoka: (Cleaning too... I don't want to have to take extra lessons... What will Kofuki-san and Yanase-san choose to do...?)\r\nKofuki: Yawn... This is taking forever.\r\nKiyoka: K-Kofuki-san! You shouldn't yawn in front of them!\r\nSuzuka: You realize, it's too late to be giving her that advice.\r\nMaki: Shichinosato Kofuki...? Is our explanation boring you?\r\nKofuki: Duh. This'd put anybody to sleep.\r\nKiyoka: (Ahh! Kofuki-san! You can't talk to them like that...!)\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san. It seems our explanation is unnecessary, so why don't we begin?\r\nMaki: I agree, Suzuka. In that case... Everyone, your training starts now!\r\nKiyoka: At least they didn't get mad...\r\nMaki: I wouldn't lose my temper over something like that, Musumi Kiyoka.\r\nMaki: Still, Shichinosato Kofuki. I'll be watching you carefully during this training. And whether you'll be able to take this seriously.\r\nKiyoka: She has her eye on you now...\r\nKofuki: ...Seems like it. Sigh, this couldn't be easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Cheating!?\r\n\r\nKiyoka: The training's started... I'm already nervous...\r\nMai: Yes, the mood in here is a little overwhelming.\r\nMai: Let's see... Looking around, more went to try the roulette and slot machines than play cards... Right?\r\nMai: Rather than relying on strategy, they probably decided luck based games would be more reliable at gathering points...\r\nKiyoka: U-Um! What are.... You two going to do?\r\nMai: Since concentration, judgment, and strategy seem important to this training, I think I'll go with cards?\r\nMai: We came here together, so why don't we all play together too?\r\nKiyoka: Ah! Okay! Let's all play together!\r\nKofuki: Pass. Strategy's not my thing.\r\nKiyoka: I figured...\r\nMai: I understand. Then, good luck.\r\n\r\nKofuki: So, now what...\r\nKiyoka: What will you do?\r\nKofuki: Huh? Why're you following me?\r\nKiyoka: I won't ask you to let me join you. But please, let me hang behind you and watch!\r\nKofuki: I don't really care, but... Why?\r\nKiyoka: Well... It's so tense in here, it's making me uncomfortable... I'd be scared by myself...\r\nKofuki: Hmmm. Well, that's how you are, I guess.\r\nKofuki: But don't come crying to me if you end up in makeup lessons, got it?\r\nKiyoka: I won't!\r\n\r\nKofuki: Alright, time to get started.\r\nKiyoka: With the slot machines?\r\nKofuki: Yep, these look like the easiest way is all. You push here to start, huh...\r\nKiyoka: It's my first time seeing a slot machine, but... They spin so fast, don't they?\r\nKofuki: But that's all there is to it; you just push the buttons at the right time. Anyway, let's watch the points roll on in.\r\n\r\nKofuki: Ughhhh, I'm already bored. Kiyoka, you know any tricks to this?\r\nKiyoka: You're asking me for help, Kofuki-san!?\r\nKiyoka: Just give me a moment, please! I'll do my best to think of something!\r\nKofuki: S-Sure. I didn't think you were so into this...?\r\nKiyoka: Oh right... I read in a book once about someone who could focus their eyes right, keep track of the slots, and match them up!\r\nKofuki: Focus your eyes right... It's too blurry to see though? They must've had some crazy perceptive vision.\r\nSuzuka: It might interest you to know that these slot machines have been uniquely modified for this training. Ordinary machines are much slower.\r\nKiyoka: For training...?\r\nKiyoka: You mean, so it would be harder to follow with your eyes...\r\nSuzuka: In order to train your kinetic vision, of course.\r\nKofuki: That's playing dirty.\r\nSuzuka: Will you continue with the slots, or will you give up? It all depends on your judgment.\r\nKofuki: The way they're acting is pissing me off. I'll try using jin'i, for now.\r\nKofuki: Just gotta get my okatana, and... Here goes nothing.\r\nKofuki: Still a little fast, but... I can see it.\r\nKofuki: That, should, do it.\r\nKiyoka: That's amazing! You got triple 7s, Kofuki-san!\r\nMaki: I heard the cheat detector go off, and look who it is.... Shichinosato Kofuki.\r\nKofuki: Huh? I wasn't cheating though? Right?\r\nKiyoka: R-Right. Kofuki-san is innocent.\r\nMaki: Come on... You used jin'i, didn't you? In this training, that's forbidden.\r\nKofuki: Are you serious...?\r\nKofuki: So what happens if I cheated? Are you kicking me out?\r\nMaki: What good would kicking you out of training do? No, until this exercise is over, you'll be competing with me.\r\nKofuki: This is the worst...\r\nMaki: Follow me, Shichinosato Kofuki.\r\n\r\nMaki: We're joining you here.\r\nMai: Oh, that's fine. ...Wait, Shidou-san, and Shichinosato-san too? Why are you two together?\r\nKofuki: I wouldn't be if I could help it.\r\nMaki: You take a seat too, Musumi Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: Ah, I-I'll just stay over here! I'm only here to cheer on Kofuki-san, so...\r\nMaki: Then you're not training anything. Sit down.\r\nKiyoka: U-Understood...\r\nKiyoka: (Why did this have to happen... There's no way I can do this all of a sudden...)\r\nMaki: Now then, are you familiar with blackjack?\r\nKofuki: Nope, not at all. Never heard the name either.\r\nMaki: ...I see, that's good to know. I'll have to explain the rules then.\r\nMaki: For starters, the blackjack you'll be playing here has one key difference from ordinary blackjack.\r\nMaki: Which is, the players will get to make their decisions while the dealer's hole card is shown.\r\nKofuki: If I don't know what it's normally like, that doesn't mean anything. How's that any different from normal?\r\nMaki: It's an adjustment so, even if you're unfamiliar with the rules, if you're astute enough you should be able to win.\r\nKofuki: Hmm, so it's like a handicap for us?\r\nMaki: You can think of it like that.\r\nMaki: As for the goal of the game, you're trying to get the cards in your hand to add up to 21.\r\nKofuki: Huh? Where's the fun in that?\r\nMaki: That's just how the game works. I'll go on.\r\nMaki: In the case that you go over 21, that's called going bust, at which point you've lost.\r\nMaki: As you might guess, the 2 through 10 cards are worth the same number value. Face cards are worth 10. The ace is either 1 or 11; you get to pick.\r\nMaki: At the start, the dealer will give you 2 cards. The dealer will also draw 2 for themselves, but only 1 of theirs will be face up.\r\nKofuki: Why'd they have to go and make this even more complicated. What's wrong with showing all of them?\r\nMaki: I told you, didn't I? This is the part of the rules we changed. During the games here, you'll get to see both of the dealer's cards from the beginning.\r\nMaki: While playing blackjack, there are 2 choices the players can make:\r\nMaki: They can hit, drawing another card. Or they can stand, if they think they can win with their current hand.\r\nMaki: As for more in depth rules...\r\nKofuki: Aghh, I get it already! This is boring! There's hit, there's stand, and you add up to 21. That's enough, right?\r\nMaki: If you're fine with that. Then, let's play blackjack.\r\n\r\n--Ten minutes later.\r\n\r\nDealer: Hole card, open. The dealer's cards reach 20.\r\nMai: 20, huh... I'm at 18, and the odds of getting a 3 are... Well, I don't think there's any helping me here.\r\nMai: It's my loss.\r\nKofuki: Oh, Mai's giving up. What about you, Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: I-I'm also at 18 too, so I...\r\nMaki: Will you forfeit too, Musumi Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: I-I'll hit... A 4... Ahh, I went bust...\r\nKofuki: So Kiyoka's busted.\r\nKofuki: And I'm at 19 here. I'm not gonna win like this, so now what? Think I can get a 2...?\r\nMaki: I'm also at 19, but this is no time to hesitate, Shichinosato Kofuki. This is where your judgment is tested... Hit!\r\nKofuki: Huhh!? At least think about it first!?\r\nMaki: No matter how much you worry, the cards won't change. I drew a 2... That makes 21, blackjack.\r\nMaki: And what will you do?\r\nKofuki: Like I'm backing down! I'll hit, okay! Gimme a 2! A 2! A 2! 2!\r\nDealer: 5... 24 in total. Shichinosato-sama has gone bust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Kofuki's Revenge\r\n\r\nKiyoka: I'm at 13, and the dealer has 16... I know I won't get a 7 though... I-I give up...\r\nKofuki: Kiyoka, you're looking pretty pale? You feeling alright?\r\nKiyoka: ...Y-Yes. I'll be fine... I think.\r\nKofuki: You don't have to force yourself, okay? Take a break if it's too much.\r\nKofuki: Now, here's my problem. The dealer's at 16, but I've got 15... I just need anything between a 1 and a 6, come on! Hit!\r\nKofuki: ...10! I went bust again!!?\r\nMai: I have 15 as well... I'll stand.\r\nKofuki: 15's not gonna win you anything though?\r\nMai: Actually, I'll be fine with this.\r\nKofuki: Don't blame me when you lose... So, what've you got?\r\nMaki: 18. I'll show you my focus and judgment in action once again, Shichinosato Kofuki.\r\nMaki: So long as I get a 3, I'll have blackjack. So... Hit.\r\nMaki: 3, and that's blackjack.\r\nKofuki: What was I supposed to learn from that!? No matter how you spin it, it's all luck! If I was lucky too, I'd have won just like that!\r\nMaki: Get a hold of yourself, Shichinosato Kofuki. Think of the purpose of this training.\r\nKofuki: I know already! We've gotta get points!\r\nMaki: I'll take that as a \"I don't know.\"  You should go cool off for a while.\r\n\r\nKofuki: Cool off, my ass! Whose fault do you think it is I'm getting pissed here!\r\nKiyoka: ...Kofuki-san.\r\nKofuki: Huh?\r\nKiyoka: This is... It's too much for me. It's too scary, playing these games together...\r\nKofuki: I mean, you sure are on a losing streak. Well, I'm not doing any better I guess.\r\nKiyoka: ...Kofuki-san, I think you're getting too carried away with Shidou-san.\r\nKiyoka: If you weren't always aiming for 21, you'd win more, I think... The opposite of me...\r\nKofuki: ...You're awesome.\r\nKiyoka: Eh?\r\nKofuki: You've got an eye for this stuff!\r\nKiyoka: Y-You think so?\r\nKofuki: What else? Did you figure out anything else?\r\nKiyoka: Ah, umm, let's see...... I'm sorry. I'm just an amateur, so I'm not really sure...\r\nKofuki: Nah, that's more than enough. I think blackjack might be your game, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: My game...\r\nKiyoka: U-Um! I think I'll give it another try!\r\nKofuki: Sure? Nobody's stopping you.\r\nKiyoka: Okay! And also, I sort of thought of something... Why don't we ask Yanase-san to teach us her technique?\r\n\r\nMai: You want me to teach you how I play blackjack?\r\nMai: I don't mind helping you one bit, but... I'm only a beginner, you know?\r\nKofuki: But you won with that 15 before.\r\nMai: That's because there's a trick to the dealer... I figured out something like a hidden rule.\r\nKiyoka: A hidden rule?\r\nMai: In all the time we've been playing, the dealer will never stand when they're at 16 or under.\r\nMai: The lowest I saw it happen was 17.\r\nKofuki: They didn't?\r\nMai: Yes. That's why, it simplifies your chances in that case. If the dealer's hand is below 16, you should stand.\r\nMai: The dealer can't stand unless they're at 17 or greater. In other words, they must hit for at least another card.\r\nKofuki: Oh, I get it. It means there's a good chance the dealer'll go bust.\r\nMai: The most important factor is the dealer's cards.\r\nMai: The one you're facing off against isn't Shidou-san or I, but the dealer instead.\r\nKofuki: The dealer, huh... Thanks, Mai. This is where our comeback starts, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: L-Let's give it a shot!\r\n\r\nKofuki: (I'm at 16, but so's the dealer...)\r\nKofuki: Oh, this is it, Kiyoka! I'm gonna stand at 16!\r\nKiyoka: R-Right! I have 17, so... I'll stand!\r\nDealer: The dealer draws an 8... 24 in total. Bust. Congratulations.\r\nKofuki: Nice! We won!\r\nKiyoka: Yes, we did it!\r\nKofuki: (So that's why you watch the dealer... This is getting interesting.)\r\nMai: Congratulations, Shichinosato-san, Musumi-san.\r\nKofuki: Yeah, it's all cause of your help, Mai, Kiyoka!\r\nKofuki: But wait, you're telling us to watch the dealer, so why're you watching our cards too?\r\nMai: I try to watch over everything as I'm competing. You can start to get an idea of which cards haven't been drawn yet like that.\r\nKiyoka: Watch over everything... Ah!\r\nKiyoka: I just realized, but... Isn't the way you play blackjack a little like the way you swordfight?\r\nMai: Oh, you might be right about that.\r\nKofuki: I could see that.\r\nKofuki: That's why senpai's style is to always go for 21. Cause when she's behind, she can always brute force her way ahead.\r\nMaki: Was that a compliment?\r\nKiyoka: U-Um, Kofuki-san! What about me?\r\nKofuki: Kiyoka? Well... You've got a real sharp eye. And, kinda like Mai, when it's make or break, you can tell-\r\nKiyoka: Our spectrum finders...!\r\nMaki: Must be aradama. Your training is temporarily on hold! Get moving!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Highly Effective Game Training\r\n\r\nKofuki: Now this's how you blow off stress!\r\nMai: Shichinosato-san! You're pushing too far ahead!\r\nKofuki: I'll be fine! You've got my back, right, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: R-Right!\r\n\r\nAradama: GAAAAAaaaaa...\r\nKofuki: See? Told you I'd be fine.\r\nMai: You mean... Because you knew Musumi-san was there?\r\nKofuki: Well, it wasn't just Kiyoka. I knew you were covering me too.\r\nKiyoka: Kofuki-san's paying attention to her surroundings while fighting...!? Is this because of the game training?\r\nKofuki: Beats me.\r\nKofuki: But it felt sort of easier to move around than usual.\r\nMai: ...I think they might end up doing this game training every year after all.\r\nMai: Shichinosato-san, if it can make you more aware of your surroundings, then there's nothing wrong with it.\r\nMai: Why don't we take care of the aradama, so we can get back to our training?\r\nKofuki: Sure! I love you, aradama-chan!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Th-That was exhausting...\r\nKiyoka: Though... Um, Kofuki-san? Could I ask you to continue where you left off before?\r\nKofuki: Huh?\r\nKiyoka: When you were comparing how we play blackjack to how we fight!\r\nKofuki: You were in the middle of doing me, weren't you?\r\nKofuki: Ahh... Oh yeah, I was. But I'm done talking about that stuff now.\r\nKiyoka: Come on~.\r\nMai: Now now, that's enough talking.\r\nMai: It's time to play blackjack, Shichinosato-san, Musumi-san.\r\nKofuki: I'm all warmed up now. I'm gonna win it this time!\r\nKiyoka: I'll try, but... I wanted to hear the rest-!\r\n\r\nSeveral days later--\r\n\r\nKofuki: Can't believe we ended up with makeup lessons anyway!\r\nKiyoka: It's a real shame... You were so close to beating Shidou-san.\r\nKofuki: But in the end, she got 3 blackjacks in a row. She kept bragging about judgment and focus, but it was all about luck in the end!\r\nKiyoka: It's hard to deny that...\r\nKofuki: You were close too, you know. You almost made it out of makeup lessons yourself.\r\nKiyoka: I know, but... I'm still happy about it.\r\nKofuki: You like cleaning that much?\r\nKiyoka: That's not what I meant. The only reason I was able to get that close in the first place...\r\nKiyoka: It's all thanks to you, Kofuki-san!\r\nKofuki: Huh? I don't remember doing anything for you though.\r\nKiyoka: You did! You helped me a lot!\r\nKofuki: I seriously don't remember anything like that.\r\nKiyoka: Fufu, well, that's okay. I remember it just fine!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Shidou Maki Joins the Battle\r\n\r\nMaki: Everyone, listen closely. This game training is at last reaching its climax.\r\nMaki: Now, to finish things, I will personally face against you as a part of your game training. Think of it like a mock battle.\r\nMaki: For the final 2 days, I've picked out the best, \"master class\" toji, to practice against you.\r\nMaki: I won't be able to participate in all these master class mock battles, but things have been arranged so I can cross swords with as many of you as possible.\r\nMaki: Those who have faith in their skills, I'd like for you to come test your strength and challenge me to a match.\r\nMaki: Of course, a reward has also been prepared for you. Those who are victorious against me will receive these \"master chips\", which...\r\nMaki: ...What the!? Excuse me, wait just a moment...!\r\nSuzuka: What's the matter, Maki-san?\r\nMaki: Suzuka, for some reason, the reward chips have my face on them...\r\nSuzuka: Well look at that. You look wonderful.\r\nMaki: Knock it off, Suzuka...\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, I'm only teasing you. These are what Yume ordered from the supplier. You left her in charge of them, didn't you?\r\nMaki: So that's what happened. Yume kept complaining she had nothing to do, so I allowed her to design the chips, but... I didn't expect her to come up with a prank like this.\r\nSuzuka: They do receive these chips for defeating you, Maki-san, so I don't necessarily think there's anything wrong with the design. You might be being too hasty deciding this is one of Yume's pranks.\r\nSuzuka: Besides, if you don't lose in these mock battles, you won't have to give out these chips, will you?\r\nMaki: That's true, but... No, while I can't help feeling embarrassed, I need to take this seriously.\r\nMaki: Sorry for interrupting the explanation. When you defeat me in the mock battles, you'll receive one of these master chips. When you collect enough, you can exchange them for your reward.\r\nMaki: ...That's all I have to tell you! Everyone, work hard to make the best of what's left of this training opportunity!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: The Amazing Ban Tsugumi\r\n\r\nKiyoka: You want to surprise Tsugumi-san...?\r\nKofuki: Apparently, she beat Senpai back in the game training.\r\nKofuki: \"How did you do, Shichinosato-san? You lost? That's impressive, Shichinosato-san. How did you manage to lose that?\"\r\nKofuki: She won't quit rubbing it in!\r\nKiyoka: She managed to win against Shidou-san!? ...Tsugumi-san's amazing, isn't she.\r\nKofuki: It was just a fluke, a fluke, okay! Ahh, dammit! It's pissing me off the way she makes it sound like I'm an idiot!\r\nKofuki: But she's known me for a long time, so the moment I start trying something she'll figure me out. That's why, Kiyoka! I'm bringing you with me!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Oh, it's Shichinosato-san and Musumi-san. What brings you two here?\r\nKofuki: You mean you couldn't figure that out? We're here to play with aradama-chan!\r\nKiyoka: Eh-!?\r\nTsugumi: That sounds about right. I'll get everything ready, so please wait a moment.\r\nKiyoka: K-Kofuki-san! Does that mean, I'll be playing with aradama too!?\r\nKofuki: What are you talking about? They're my aradama-chan, okay? You're here to surprise her.\r\nKiyoka: You never told me what we're doing though!?\r\nTsugumi: It's all set for you, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: Cool, I'll be right there! Well, you gotta think on the fly.\r\nKiyoka: Ehhh-!?\r\n\r\nKiyoka: (N-Now I'm alone with her... How am I supposed to surprise her...)\r\nTsugumi: Now then, Musumi-san. Shichinosato-san asked you to do something, didn't she?\r\nKiyoka: How did you know!?\r\nTsugumi: So I was right after all. It was something along the lines of \"give me a surprise\", wasn't it?\r\nKiyoka: Th-That's right... Eh? But how did you figure it out?\r\nTsugumi: I can tell just by watching Shichinosato-san. Yesterday she was full of anger, but she has been grinning to herself all day today.\r\nTsugumi: At times like this, Shichinosato-san is almost certainly up to some kind of mischief.\r\nKiyoka: Amazing... That's amazing, Tsugumi-san! You're like a detective!\r\nTsugumi: It's nothing that outstanding, really. Anyway, can I get you something to drink?\r\nKiyoka: Sure! I'll have some! And, could I ask you more about Kofuki-san, please!\r\nTsugumi: That's fine. To the extent that I can answer, at least.\r\nKofuki: Seriously, nothing beats aradama-chan. So, how'd it go, Kiyoka? Did you get her?\r\nTsugumi: Yes, she got me good. I never expected her to make a face like that. Here are your drinks. This one is for you, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKiyoka: Ah, oh, thank you.\r\nKiyoka: (I didn't make any face, but I guess she believed it? ...Actually, this drink, it has a weird color to it... What is it exactly...!?!??)\r\nKofuki: Bleh, this's awful!\r\nTsugumi: Is it? I blended fish oil, dried sardines, oyster, and other marine products into milk. I've had an interest in it lately.\r\nKofuki: Don't put fish in milk! Shit, you made me drink something messed up again!\r\nKiyoka: Again? Does she often get you to drink things like that...? Tsugumi-san is... In a lot of ways, an amazing person, isn't she..."}, {"paste_key": "4n5EdGHY", "title": "2-11 The Netherworld", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/4n5EdGHY", "timestamp": "", "hits": "130", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPuTqgR0UmU\r\n\r\n1: At the Mouth of the Netherworld\r\n\r\nIchikishima: ......\r\nHana: So that's Ichikishimahime, which split off from Tagitsuhime...

We have to figure things out here by ourselves...)\r\nKiyoka: To tell the truth, I'm feeling very nervous...\r\nMirja: In that case, you could remain here if you like.\r\nKiyoka: No, I know if I were waiting here for all of you to get back, I'd be feeling even more nervous the whole time...\r\nKiyoka: So... I want to help, so we can all come back together!\r\nYui: Well, even if we don't make it back, it could be pretty fun living in the netherworld!\r\nMihono: Sometimes, Yui, you're so positive it's scary...\r\nMaki: All of you from the investigation team, I want to thank you again.

It has to be. So far, so good, I think.\r\nSuzuka: Although, I don't see anyone else around. It's only us here.\r\nMaki: We must have been separated from the other toji... We should keep moving forward at least.\r\nSuzuka: Forward? Do you have any idea which way forward is?\r\nMaki: Of course, I don't have any kind of map. But we'll have to rely on our instincts.\r\nMaki: We can't waste a moment finding Yume.\r\nSuzuka: You're right. Somewhere in this place, Yume...\r\nSuzuka: ............\r\nMaki: What is it, Suzuka?\r\nSuzuka: At that time, I told you I would deal with Yume's remains... But I couldn't bring myself to do it...\r\nSuzuka: Because of that, I've caused you so much suffering... I'm sor--\r\nMaki: Don't say that.\r\nSuzuka: ...Eh?\r\nMaki: Everything I've suffered, I did so because I chose this path. None of this is your fault.\r\nMaki: There's no reason for you to feel guilty about anything that's happened to me, Suzuka.\r\nMaki: All I feel towards you is gratitude, for leaving me this chance to save Yume.\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san...\r\nMaki: That's right, Suzuka. There's something I should say too.\r\nMaki: For supporting me when I said I wanted to save her... Thank you so much.\r\nSuzuka: Of course I did. Yume is every bit as precious to me.\r\nSuzuka: ...Maki-san! We are going to get Yume back.\r\nMaki: Right... For sure.\r\nAradama: GURURURURRUUUUUUU...!\r\nSuzuka: -!

I'm honored you have so much faith in me.\r\nMaki: We should keep on moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Great Aradama \"Kai\" (1)\r\n\r\nKofuki: Looks like we made it to the netherworld in one piece.\r\nKiyoka: But there's only the seven of us from the investigation team. I don't see Shidou-san or Konohana-san anywhere...?\r\nKofuki: You think maybe they screwed up and those two died already?\r\nMihono: Fukki-! Don't say things like that-! I'm sure they just ended up somewhere else!\r\nYui: When the gate to the netherworld opened, they were standing away from us, weren't they?\r\nMirja: For the time being, we should search through the netherworld.\r\nChie: ......\r\nHana: ...Chie-san. Have you still not made up your mind about saving Yume-san?\r\nChie: ...Honestly, I'm still opposed to it. When I think of everyone in Mokusa, I can't help but feel that way.\r\nChie: ...But, if this leads to defeating Tagitsuhime, what all of us in Mokusa fought to accomplish, then I won't hesitate to use Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi.\r\nMihono: --!! Guys!! Over there!! Is that the great aradama we're here for!?\r\nChie: That's Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu embedded in its chest... There's no mistaking it...\r\nKai: Remove from me, this accursed blade... Ahh, how contemptible... You humans... Gghh...\r\nMirja: ...This is the great aradama we must defeat. And, the true Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu.\r\nChie: If we beat it, Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu is ours... Not just here in the netherworld, we can bring the real thing back...\r\nMihono: Guys! Here it comes! We're definitely going to win this!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Great Aradama \"Kai\" (2)\r\n\r\nKai: Nghaahh... Am I struck down again... By humans like you...!!\r\nMirja: Go now, Setouchi Chie! Pierce it with Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi!\r\nChie: --Hah!!\r\nKai: GAAAAGHH...! Infuriating... You toji...!!\r\nMihono: You did it! We did it! Chii-nee!\r\nChie: This is... The real Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu...!!\r\nKiyoka: We finally found it! We spent all this time looking as the investigation team, and there it is!\r\nHana: It was worth risking coming to the netherworld after all.\r\nKofuki: Heheh. It's been a while since I fought an aradama-chan with some bite to it. So what, should we head back home--\r\nMirja: No. We aren't finished here.\r\nYui: What do you mean...? Mirja-san? Ahh, oh right! We're not done yet!\r\nMirja: Until we use the true Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu to free Tsubakuro Yume from the netherworld... Our mission isn't finished.\r\nMihono: Oh yeah! Then, we have to hurry and help Shidou-san find Tsubakuro-san!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: To Be Burnt in Everyone's Memory (1)\r\n\r\nSuzuka: ...We haven't seen a trace of the others we came here with...\r\nMaki: This isn't good. If we found the great aradama, without Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi, we wouldn't be able to do anything...\r\n???: Aha-! I found you, some strong looking toji~!\r\nSuzuka: ---!? Yume!? Is that you, Yume!?\r\nMaki: Yume...! Let's go back together... We're taking you back home!\r\nYume: Yume...? Back home... To where?\r\nSuzuka: Eh...?\r\nYume: Who are you onee-sans?\r\nSuzuka: You mean... You don't know... Could Yume's memories have...\r\nMaki: The Yume in the netherworld might have lost her memories of our world.\r\nMaki: Or, if she's forgotten everything about us, she might only have her memories from before taking noro.\r\nYume: Hey, onee-sans! This is a world where everyone will remember me as the strongest toji!\r\nSuzuka: ...? What are you saying?\r\nYume: I'm the toji who's stronger than anybody else! And I'll make sure everyone remembers me that way!\r\nYume: Watch out! Yume's behaving strangely!\r\nYume: I'll show you two... Why I'm the strongest!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: To Be Burnt in Everyone's Memory (2)\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Pant... Pant... It seems... We managed to stop her...\r\nMaki: ...Yume. Come back with us, to the real world.\r\nYume: No......\r\nMaki: You don't belong in this place. There's another world you're meant to be in.\r\nYume: ......No! I haven't done enough yet! I want everyone to remember me as someone better than this!\r\nYume: I don't need anything else!\r\nSuzuka: Yume...\r\nMaki: I get it, Yume... That's the reason you accepted noro...\r\nKiyoka: --Ah! Look over there! It's Shidou-san and Konohana-san!\r\nMirja: Along with Tsubakuro Yume, from the look of things.\r\nKofuki: So they managed to find her on their own.\r\nYui: That's great! ...Wait? It doesn't look like Tsubakuro-san's doing too well though...\r\nHana: Of course. After all, without the real Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, Tsubakuro-san can't be freed...\r\nMihono: Chii-nee...\r\nChie: ............\r\nMihono: Chii-nee!\r\nChie: ...For everyone in Mokusa.........!\r\nChie: Shidou-san! Take this... The true Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, and save her...!\r\nMaki: ......!\r\nMaki: I'm in your debt! Someday... I'll pay you back for this!\r\nMaki: ...Yume!! I won't let you stay here alone! We're going back together!!\r\nMaki: To where you belong!\r\nMaki: HAAAAAAAAHH----!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: A Rescue, a Promise, and Impatience\r\n\r\nKiyoka: I think we made it back out safely.\r\nHana: Ahh! Look at that! There's light coming from Tsubakuro-san's body...!\r\nChie: Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi is stuck in her chest... So then...\r\nMirja: Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi is disappearing from her!\r\nYui: What does that mean...? Did we save Tsubakuro-san...?\r\nYume: ...Huh? Where...? I'm...\r\nMaki: Yume-! Do you know who I am-!?\r\nSuzuka: Do you remember me!?\r\nYume: Y-Yeahhh... I-It's hard to breathe, when you're hugging me like that...\r\nYume: ...Maki onee-san, Suzuka onee-san.\r\nSuzuka: Yume! Yume!\r\nMaki: Ahh... You know me, don't you, Yume!?\r\nYume: Of course... I do. Stop shouting in my ear like that. You're too loud...\r\nYume: ...Nn. I can't really, move around right.\r\nMaki: In time, I promise you'll be back to normal. You just have to rest now.\r\nSuzuka: Do as we say and stay in bed, Yume. That's your punishment for making us worry so much.\r\nYume: Ehh~...? I don't remember doing anything to make you worry though...?\r\nYume: ---Wait? Maki onee-san, Suzuka onee-san... Why are you... Crying?\r\nSuzuka: Because we were reunited with someone very important to us.\r\nMaki: ......I'm going to go wash my face.\r\n\r\nMaki: ......Setouchi Chie. I'll repay you for this someday, I swear.\r\nChie: ...I haven't forgiven what you people did yet.\r\nMaki: Right, I know that... Actually, I'd rather...\r\nMaki: I'd rather you never forgave what I've done.\r\nMaki: This debt and these sins. I promise I'll return it, I promise I'll pay for them. Believe me.\r\nMaki: I've already sold my soul once, after all. Whatever you want from me, no matter what it is, I'll help you.\r\n\r\nMihono: ...U-Uhh~, I don't really understand what happened, but everyone's safe and sound, right! It's all alright~...\r\nKofuki: The netherworld was funner than I expected. I got to fight a bigass aradama-chan too. Next time I get the chance, I'm going back.\r\nKiyoka: I think I'm never doing that again...\r\nChie: But...\r\nMirja: That's right. We've lost Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu.\r\nHana: It was supposed to be the ace up our sleeve when it came to finishing off a great aradama.\r\nYui: It was. So how're we supposed to defeat Tagitsuhime now? What's going to happen to us now that we can't?\r\nHana: Huh? Yui, I've never seen you this negative before.\r\nMihono: Yui, we can come up with a way to stop her together! After all, the elite guard are on our side now!\r\nMihono: With all of us working together... With all us toji on a team...\r\nMihono: We can do anything! Where there's a will, there's a way! Right, guys!\r\nMihono: Because after all, you're the ones who taught me that... All my friends!\r\nMihono: When I'm with you all, I know there's nothing that can stop us!\r\nChie: Mmhm, Mihono-chan's right. We're all here for each other.\r\nKiyoka: Right. We made it this far, didn't we. There's no use giving up now.\r\nKofuki: You guys can keep dragging me around so long as there's aradama-chan waiting for me.\r\nHana: I'm so glad I was given this assignment. ...This is what they call true friendship, isn't it?\r\nYui: Ahhhhhh... Friendship is so beautiful... The bonds between girls can never be broken, you know... Ahh... Uuuhuhu...\r\nMihono: With all of us together, no matter what happens, we'll stop Tagitsuhime, I know it! So let's keep on fighting!\r\nMirja: (In the end, President Souraku was never once involved in this operation.)\r\nMirja: (Despite creating this investigation team, despite entrusting Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi to Setouchi Chie... Where is she?)\r\nMirja: (Ayanokouji Martial Arts School. President Souraku. What is happening to them--)\r\n\r\nYukina: How long do you plan on making us wait! Hurry up and make your selections from the list of candidates!\r\nYuzuki: ......\r\n\r\n...Strengthening Project Candidate List: Uchizato Ayumu, Kitora Mirja, Yamashiro Yui, Suzumoto Hana..."}, {"paste_key": "gkZaVcFt", "title": "Grand Opening!

We should get this meeting started straight away.\r\nMaki: Members of the executive committee, thank you all for gathering today to discuss the Five Traditions Unified School Festival. I'm Shidou Maki, filling the role of committee chairman.\r\nSuzuka: I, Konohana Suzuka, am assistant executive committee chairman. Everyone, let's work together to create a wonderful festival.\r\nStudents: Yes!\r\nKiyoka: (What do I do... I wasn't thinking, so I thought \"Joining the school festival's executive committee sounds exciting!\", but now...)\r\nKiyoka: (This feels like it could be a much more serious job...)\r\nMaki: To begin with, we need to settle on which activities the school festival will be performing. Does anyone have any ideas they'd like to propose?\r\nStudents: ......\r\nMaki: Nobody...?\r\nSuzuka: It takes courage to be the first to state your opinion. Perhaps we should begin by offering our own proposals?\r\nMaki: Good point. Then, I'll start with my idea. With toji from every school gathered here, why don't we hold a tournament that decides the strongest of them all?\r\nYume: Ooh, let's do that, let's do that! It sounds fun!\r\nMaki: Right?\r\nFemale Student A: *whispering* Wait, but then it sounds like non-toji students don't get to do anything...\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san, Yume. That would be no different from the official yearly tournament.\r\nMaki: Er, you have a point...\r\nMaki: Coming up with an idea for the festival is harder than it seems. What do you think, Suzuka?\r\nSuzuka: Let's see... Since it is a festival after all, why not hold a formal dress party?\r\nSuzuka: Along with that, it would be nice to invite an orchestra to perform a classical concert for us.\r\nFemale Student B: *whispering* What does a formal party have to do with a school festival...\r\nFemale Student C: *whispering* A classical concert is gonna put people to sleep...\r\nYume: That's way too serious, Suzuka onee-san! It just sounds boring!\r\nYume: We should do a swordfighting tournament after all-! Everyone from the Five Traditions is gonna be there anyway~!\r\nMaki: Hmmm... Yomi, why don't you tell us what you think?\r\nYomi: In my case... I have no preference when it comes to the subject of the school festival.\r\nYomi: But, I think it's necessary we consider in advance what kind of aradama countermeasures to prepare.\r\nMaki: ......\r\nSuzuka: What's wrong, Maki-san?\r\nMaki: ...Nothing, I just remembered a request that President Hashima and President Gojou asked of me.\r\nYume: What'd those old ladies want?\r\nMaki: They said \"When it comes to the Five Traditions unified school festival, be sure to keep it student appropriate and do something everyone attending can enjoy.\"\r\nSuzuka: Thinking on the \"student appropriate\" part, our suggestions have been somewhat off, haven't they.\r\nMaki: But what should we do...\r\nKiyoka: Um...\r\nMaki: What is it? Musumi Kiyoka. If you have a proposal, speak up and share it.\r\nMaki: Y-Yes!\r\nKiyoka: Um... I'm not sure if my ideas will be any good, but...\r\nSuzuka: Don't be shy, tell everyone.\r\nKiyoka: Uh... We could all wear cute matching dresses, and work at a maid cafe?\r\nFemale Student D: Huh... Well that's better than a swordfighting tournament or a classical concert.\r\nKiyoka: And then... We could get the girls who are good at singing and dancing together, and have a live show on stage!\r\nFemale Student A: That could work! I've always wanted to be a part of a girl band!\r\nKiyoka: And also, all the students from all the schools could do a beauty pageant!\r\nFemale Student B: Sounds like fun! My girl's better looking than most, you know.\r\nMaki: That's surprising... They were so quiet before, but now they're all joining in.\r\nKiyoka: Ah... I'm sorry! I'm talking too much, aren't I.\r\nSuzuka: Not at all. Your ideas seem to be quite popular.\r\nSuzuka: Everyone, what do you think about using her suggestions?\r\nStudents: WE APPROVE-!\r\nKiyoka: (Thank goodness. I think I managed to help out.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Distribution of Roles\r\n\r\nMaki: Okay, now we have a general idea of what activities we'll be doing during the festival. To continue, we should assign everyone's positions.\r\nMaki: Members of the executive committee will be responsible for different roles on the day of the school festival. If there's a position you want, you can go ahead and claim it...\r\nSuzuka: In that case, why not let Musumi-san, who came up with those great suggestions, choose the role she wants first.\r\nKiyoka: N-No, I couldn't! I'd be fine helping with any position! The maid cafe, the beauty pageant, or the live stage, I'll do my best to help wherever you need me to!\r\nYomi: Musumi-san, are you sure about that?\r\nKiyoka: Yes. There's so many things I want to do that it's hard to pick just one... I know! To keep things fair, why don't we use a lottery to decide?\r\nMaki: Understood. If that's how you want it, we'll do it.\r\n\r\nAfter drawing the lottery--\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Aww...\r\nKiyoka: (I said I'd do my best at anything, but I didn't think I'd draw the most boring one...)\r\nKiyoka: (Security duty patrolling the neighborhood. Which means, I have to be standing around far away from the actual festival...)\r\nMaki: How did it come to this... Why am I assigned to the maid cafe?\r\nSuzuka: What are the chances, that's my position too. And Yume and Yomi's as well.\r\nYume: There's gonna be lots of guests coming to the maid cafe, right? Since they're all coming from the Five Traditions, that means there could be strong girls in there too! I wanna fight them already!\r\nSuzuka: Yume... A maid cafe is no place to be starting fights.\r\nMaki: ...\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYume: What's with you two?\r\nMaki: Does this mean I'll have to be serving guests in a maid uniform...?\r\nYomi: It's nothing... The lottery's outcome has me slightly shocked...\r\nKiyoka: I know what you mean. It was a bit of a shock for me too, being on the security team...\r\nYomi: ...Musumi-san, I have a proposal. You could trade duties with me.\r\nKiyoka: Eh, you don't have to go that far!\r\nMaki: I see, I hadn't considered that... If I could be on the security team instead, then I'd rather...\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san, Yomi. You can't always go around expecting to only do security work.\r\nMaki: I know, but... I can't be a maid...\r\nYomi: I'd be better suited patrolling the area than serving guests...\r\nYume: Ehh, then I want to be doing that too!\r\nSuzuka: Hold it right there! We of the elite guard have been entrusted to supervise and manage this entire school festival.\r\nSuzuka: So don't you think it would be wrong to have three of us patrolling outside the school grounds?\r\nYomi: ...When you say it that way, it's difficult not to agree...\r\nSuzuka: Unless something urgent happens, the elite guard should remain inside the school grounds.\r\nMaki: It's like you said... Yomi, I think we should try to do the duties the lottery gave us, but what do you think?\r\nYomi: ...I understand. Whatever task I'm given, I will do everything in my power to carry out.\r\nKiyoka: (...It's disappointing, but I'll try to do my best on patrol too...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Grand Opening! The Five Traditions Unified School Festival\r\n\r\nOn the day of the Five Traditions Unified School Festival--\r\n\r\nMaki: There's more guests than I expected. I knew the executive committee would be busy, but can they handle this...?\r\nSuzuka: Everyone's putting in a good effort. You too, Maki-san. When you have the time, feel free to take a break. You must be tired; you were running around all morning.\r\nMaki: This much is nothing for me... Or I'd like to say that, but this is too different from the duties I'm used to. I don't want to make any mistakes, so I'll rest while I can.\r\nYume: Hey, hey, aren't you onee-sans gonna be maids too?\r\nMaki: It isn't our shift yet.\r\nMaki: Though, Yume. Aren't you supposed to be serving at the cafe right now? Want to explain why you're out here still in your usual uniform?\r\nYume: Boo. It's no fun there if you and Suzuka onee-san aren't gonna come!\r\nMaki: Still, we decided that it was your duty to be there right now. You have to stick to the schedule. Go on, hurry up back to the cafe.\r\nYume: Fiiine.\r\nMaki: Alright, next they need me as an announcer on stage. Starting in three minutes. If I hurry, I can make it in time.\r\n\r\nAt that time, outside the school festival grounds--\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Sigh... I know security is important and all... But am I really going to miss the whole festival standing out here...\r\nKiyoka: The band should be playing up on stage right about now. That must be so exciting...\r\nMihono: Huh? Kiyoka?\r\nChie: What are you doing out here?\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan! And you too, Setouchi-san. Why are you here?\r\nChie: The crepe stand we're managing ran out of ingredients, so we had to run out and buy more.\r\nMihono: You should come check it out later, Kiyoka. Chii-nee makes some super yummy crepes!\r\nKiyoka: I wish I could go, but... I'm busy with my duties.\r\nChie: That's right, you're on the executive committee, aren't you? You must have a lot of responsibilities.\r\nKiyoka: Yes, it's my job today to patrol the perimeter of the school festival.\r\nMihono: Oh, really? Sorry, we had no idea and came up and bothered you...\r\nKiyoka: No, don't worry about it!\r\nKiyoka: But Hono-chan, you should get going. Everyone's waiting for you to bring back those ingredients, right?\r\nMihono: Yeah... Then, I'll see you later, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: Have a good time.\r\nKiyoka: Sigh... Now I'm alone again.\r\nKiyoka: That crepe stand sounds like fun... The maid cafe must be busy too...\r\nKiyoka: Huh? Someone's calling.\r\nKiyoka: It's from Shidou-san! Why would she call me...\r\nKiyoka: Hello, this is executive committee member Musumi Kiyoka, on patrol. What do you need from me?\r\nMaki: An emergency came up. Musumi Kiyoka, return to the school as fast as possible.\r\nKiyoka: Eh-, what happened...?\r\nMaki: I'll explain the details after you arrive. Come quickly.\r\nKiyoka: She hung up... What sort of emergency do they need me for?\r\nKiyoka: Ah... Does that mean aradama appeared in the festival!?\r\nKiyoka: I have to get back there!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Pant... Pant... Musumi Kiyoka, is here.\r\nMaki: Good, you're here already. Something unexpected came up.\r\nKiyoka: Yes, please tell me what happened!\r\nMaki: Right, actually... The maid cafe is a runaway success, and we're severely understaffed there...\r\nKiyoka: Eh...?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The School Festival I Dreamt Of\r\n\r\nKiyoka: The maid cafe... Is understaffed? Then, why did you call me here...?\r\nMaki: I'm sorry to ask this suddenly, but I want you to change positions to serving at the maid cafe.\r\nKiyoka: Y-You want me to be a maid?\r\nSuzuka: Yes. We've decided to reassign 10% of the security team to the maid cafe. And you're one of them.\r\nMaki: Your uniform has already been prepared for you. Once you're ready, begin standing in the hall and helping guests.\r\nKiyoka: Um... But then, will there be enough people helping security?\r\nYomi: You shouldn't be concerned with that. In place of the ones reassigned, I will become part of the security team.\r\nKiyoka: Just by yourself, Satsuki-san...?\r\nYomi: Extensive search and lookout assignments are my specialty.\r\nYomi: If that's all, I'll go to my post.\r\nKiyoka: Ah... Satsuki-san, she left...\r\nKiyoka: Is it really okay, letting Satsuki-san handle that much by herself?\r\nSuzuka: Of course. Interacting with the guests was leaving Yomi fairly worn out.\r\nSuzuka: We decided it would be a better use of their talents putting people in roles they're more accustomed to.\r\nMaki: Musumi Kiyoka. I'd like for you to start working in your new position straight away.\r\nKiyoka: Ah... Understood! Of course I will!\r\nKiyoka: (I can't believe I get to serve guests at the maid cafe! I'm so glad I tried the executive committee!)\r\nPassing Guest: Excuse me, I want to go to the maid cafe. Can you tell me which way it is?\r\nKiyoka: In that case, I'll guide you there, master!\r\nSuzuka: Musumi-san immediately understands how to win a guest's heart. Having them switch positions was the right idea after all.\r\nMaki: Agreed. Everyone has something they're better cut out for.\r\n\r\nAnd like that, the school festival finished without incident--\r\n\r\nMaki: So it's already time to shut it down. I'm glad everything went smoothly.\r\nYomi: Because of my reassignment, I was also able to fulfill my duties until the end. Thank you very much.\r\nSuzuka: We received nothing but praise from both our guests and the presidents. Job well done, everyone.\r\nKiyoka: It's a little sad, saying goodbye already...\r\nYume: You looked like you were having a lot of fun being a maid, Onee-san!\r\nMaki: That's for sure. Even I was hearing about the reputation you built up among the guests.\r\nMaki: From helping with the preparations, to working security, to even serving guests, having you around was a huge relief. Thanks.\r\nKiyoka: You don't have to go that far... I just wanted to have a good time with everyone...\r\nSuzuka: Everything turned out so well in part thanks to those feelings. I'd like to thank you as well, Musumi-san.\r\nYume: Yeah, you helped me out a lot too! Thanks, Onee-san!\r\nKiyoka: Hearing that from all of you... Makes me glad.\r\nKiyoka: (I was nervous at first... But I'm glad I tried this...)"}, {"paste_key": "TGajJBrP", "title": "Take Back a Twinkling Christmas Eve!", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/TGajJBrP", "timestamp": "", "hits": "116", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9JTl61Px6I\r\n\r\n1: Take Back a Twinkling Christmas Eve! Prologue\r\n\r\n--On the night of Christmas Eve, the streets, which every year were covered in twinkling lights, were looking strangely empty this year.\r\n\r\nYui: Whyyy!? Why are all the lights off this year!?\r\nOld Salesman: W-Well, you see, we tried turning them on, okay?\r\nOld Salesman: But you know, as soon as we did, it started attracting aradama.\r\nYui: B-But in that case, we can get rid of them! So please, if you have a heart, turn the lights back onnn!\r\nOld Salesman: I wish I could help you out here, but... Look, when we put the ornaments up, the aradama got tangled up in them and dragged them away.\r\nOld Salesman: So we're out of ornaments, and I don't want any more aradama coming round. Maybe it's better just to give up on it this year?\r\nYui: ...I'll get... Them back...\r\nOld Salesman: Eh?\r\nYui: I'll get back every last one of the ornaments! And I'll get rid of all the aradama myself-!\r\nYui: Then you'll turn the lights back on for me, right!?\r\nOld Salesman: L-Look, I'm not the only one responsible here... Anyway, were you really looking forward to the lights that much?\r\nYui: Take a look at that!\r\nHigh School Girl Returning from Cram School: Aww, there's no lights up this year. This is the worst.\r\nHigh School Boy Returning from Cram School: I remember you loved seeing them last year.\r\nYui: And look over there!\r\nOL Returning from Work 1: Last year's lights were the prettiest thing to a lonely girl on Christmas, but it's even sadder if they're not doing them...\r\nOL Returning from Work 2: Come on now, let's go to the bar together~ Hey mister, pour two for us!\r\nYui: Do you see!?\r\nOld Salesman: ...Uh... See what??\r\nYui: This part of town is loaded with girls coming round to see the decorations!!\r\nYui: And they need to see those shining lights!! So I'm going to save Christmas!!!!\r\nOld Salesman: O-Ohh, I guess you're right...\r\nYui: Then I'll be right back after I hunt down those aradama! I'm counting on you to turn those lights back on!\r\nOld Salesman: Ah, hey! ...She's gone already. I don't have the authority for something like that though...\r\nOld Salesman: I guess I can try calling up the local officials and commerce association at least...\r\n\r\n--At the same time, a few streets away...\r\n\r\nMirja: Sigh... No sign of the Akabane sword here either, it seems.\r\nMirja: I suppose it won't be that easy after all.\r\n\r\n--Earlier on the same day, shortly after noon at Aoto-kan.\r\n\r\nAoto Youji: Yo, missy. I'm glad as can be you decided to pay me a visit today, but...\r\nMirja: What is it, Aoto Youji-san.\r\nYouji: Well, I mean, it's a bit sad seeing a pretty young lady like yourself hiding away looking at swords on Christmas Eve.\r\nMirja: I don't find it sad in the slightest. I'm off duty today, so I thought appreciating swords and their mountings would be a perfect use of my time.\r\nYouji: Haha, there's no stopping you, is there, missy.\r\nYouji: Oh right, speaking of Christmas and winter days, I wonder if you've heard this one before?\r\nMirja: Heard what?\r\nYouji: There's an okatana said to be as fleeting as the snow itself. Name's \"Sekka\".\r\nMirja: This is the first I've heard of it... Is there anything more you can tell me?\r\nYouji: Course. The blade itself is a pure blueish white, like snow crystals, and there's a rumor that, during the winter season, this okatana'll show a divine power one time if its owner asks.\r\nMirja: I see, that's an interesting story. If there is an okatana like that out there, I'd like to be able to see it for myself once.\r\nYouji: You know, it's part of the rumor that, this time of year, Sekka's one of those Akabane swords they find out of aradama.\r\nMirja: FWHA-!?\r\nMirja: ...Excuse me, is that true? Does it have to be any specific aradama, in any specific place, or will any do?\r\nYouji: Y-Yeah, I think anywhere'll do. Every couple of years you hear about someone coming across Sekka.\r\nYouji: I've never been able to witness it myself, but... Well, even if someone does find it, it doesn't seem to stick around for them to use it very long.\r\nMirja: I can't afford to waste any more time. I'll begin suppressing aradama right away.\r\nYouji: Sekka's nice and all, but don't you want to take a look at this? It's these special \"Holy Night\" mountings we've got just for the Christmas season, and...\r\nYouji: ......\r\n\r\nMirja: There's no use complaining about it. So long as I continue defeating aradama...\r\nMirja: Oh, more have appeared.\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui! What are you...\r\nYui: Ah, it's Mirja-san! Nnnn~, I'd love to stay and share my love with you, but I'm busy right now, so it'll have to wait till next time, sorry-!!\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui should have had today off as well... Could she be after Sekka too?\r\nMirja: Heh, then I have no intention of losing here. I'll be the first to find Sekka!\r\n\r\nYui: Pant, pant... There's still a ton of aradama left. I've gotta get those lights turned on soon!\r\nYui: Haah-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Take Back a Twinkling Christmas Eve! Epilogue\r\n\r\nYui: Pant... Wheeze... Not yet... Aradama... Gotta get rid of... All of them...\r\nYui: Ughh...\r\nYui: Guess that's it for me.\r\nYui: I'm falling apart. I can't get back up.\r\nYui: The lights still aren't on though... I can't let today end without finishing this.\r\nYui: There's no time for me to rest here.\r\nYui: So get up already!\r\nSomeone's Voice: ...shi...i!\r\nSomeone's Voice: ...mashiro...i!\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui! Can you hear me!?\r\nYui: Mirja... San...?\r\nMirja: You've regained consciousness. That's good.\r\nMirja: Just as I was impressed with how aggressively you dealt with those aradama, you suddenly collapsed in the street. I was worried, so...\r\nYui: Mirja-san was worried about me... I might faint!!\r\nMirja: Though it seems my concerns were unnecessary.\r\nMirja: Ahem... Anyway, have you found what you were after?\r\nYui: Huh? What I'm after...? Ah, the lights still aren't on, are they?\r\nMirja: Huh? Lights?\r\nYui: Right, once I remove all the aradama around here and get back the Christmas ornaments, they'll turn the Christmas lights back on!\r\nMirja: O-Ohhh...?\r\nMirja: (Does this mean I jumped to conclusions and unnecessarily made Yamashiro Yui my rival...?)\r\nYui: What's wrong, Mirja-san? You're blushing?\r\nMirja: I-It's nothing. More importantly, what about the lights? The aradama in the area have been largely cleared out...\r\nYui: I got a lot of the ornaments back too, so I was thinking it can't take much more...\r\nMirja: Hm... To tell the truth, I was here suppressing aradama for another reason... Why don't we combine forces to finish the job?\r\nYui: Ehhh-!? Just you and me in a tag team, Mirja-san!?\r\nYui: Hnng~! If only I knew there was a reward like that waiting for me! Hard work gets repaid after all!\r\nMirja: ...I feel like I'm losing more than I offered, but I'll let it slide. Let's move out.\r\nYui: Sure thing!\r\n\r\nYui: Mirja-san! Don't you feel like we're totally in sync today?\r\nMirja: It's true that our coordination is smoother than usual today. But I'm more surprised by that perseverance of yours, Yamashiro Yui.\r\nYui: I know, right! I thought I was at my limit back there, but now I feel like I can just keep on going!\r\nYui: It must be the power of our love that let us bust through those barriers!\r\nMirja: I'm certain that isn't the case, but let's keep up this momentum and continue the attack!\r\nYui & Mirja: WOAAAAH!!\r\n\r\nYui: Pant... Pant... Was that... All of them...?\r\nMirja: Pant... Yamashiro... Yui... Take a look... Around us...\r\nFemale Student: Ooohh. For real, they turned the lights on? That's perfect!\r\nDrunken OL: Wh-What, what!? They're doing the lights again? Ahhahaha! This's the best! Being single's the best!\r\nYui: Mmmm~, this is it! This energy! This is the real Christmas spirit! We did it, Mirja-san!\r\nMirja: Yes, seeing everyone pleased makes it all worth it.\r\nYui: Now that's what I call mission complete!\r\nYui: Oh, my phone. Sorry, I have to take this...\r\nYui: Mm, it's Onee-chan. Are you okay being up this late?\r\nYui: ...Oh, so you can see the lights from the hospital?\r\nYui: That's great. I know you were looking forward to it. Yeah, I can see them too.\r\nYui: They sure are pretty~... I hope we can see them together next year.\r\nYui: Mm... Okay... Oh yeah, for your present, you still want the same thing, right?\r\nYui: Yep, I already told Santa about it.\r\nMirja: I see... The power of love, wasn't it?\r\nYui: Ah, sorry that took a while. So what do we do now?\r\nMirja: Hm. More aradama could appear, so perhaps we should walk around and patrol the area, so they don't turn the lights off again.\r\nYui: Wait, that sounds like... Are you asking me out on a Christmas date!?\r\nMirja: I am not. Maybe we should patrol separately just to be sure.\r\nYui: I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I want to be with you, Mirja-san! Let's go!\r\nMirja: Hang on, who said you could wrap your arm around mine?\r\nYui: Just let this be my reward for saving everyone's Christmas! Just for a little bit!\r\nMirja: Honestly... Fine, for a little bit.\r\n\r\nMirja: And that's what happened... What's wrong, Aoto Youji-san? Are you crying?\r\nYouji: Yamashiro-chan, what a good girl, thinking of her sister.\r\nYouji: Oh right, what happened on your end, missy?\r\nMirja: With Sekka? I found it, and had it restored and polished. Like you said, it's an okatana with a dreamlike beauty...\r\nYouji: Ohh! Well I'm glad to hear it.\r\nMirja: Unfortunately, I wasn't chosen by Sekka, but other members of [your unit name here] are able to make use of it.\r\nYouji: At least that worked out. Ah, right, bring it by here sometime and I'll make some special mountings for it.\r\nMirja: I'd appreciate that.\r\nYouji: You might only have it for a short while, but you'll want to use Sekka the best you can!\r\nMirja: Right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: How Those Two Spent Christmas\r\n\r\nKofuki: Damnit... I've been looking all over, but she's not even at the Christmas party, is she.\r\nMai: Oh? Shichinosato-san?\r\nKofuki: Hey, it's Sayaka and her keeper. You two done with the party already?\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan's keeper...\r\nSayaka: We were going back to the party. ...Kofuki, what are you doing?\r\nKofuki: Ahh, just looking for someone. Seeya.\r\nMai: Did she lose one of her friends?\r\nSayaka: I think so... The research lab is that way.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: That should be it for the database of aradama that appeared during the Christmas Unified Mock Battle.\r\nTsugumi: With Shichinosato-san's help, collecting this information became much easier. I'll have to maintain that relationship.\r\nTsugumi: She must be enjoying herself at the party right about now.\r\nTsugumi: Fufu... There's aradama nearby?\r\nTsugumi: I had heard that, while the party is ongoing, the elite guard would be responsible for aradama countermeasures, so everyone's busy at the moment.\r\nTsugumi: In which case, I suppose I get to handle data collection here myself. Let's see, where's my okatana... Ah.\r\nKofuki: Oi, you planning on keeping all the aradama-chan to yourself?\r\nTsugumi: Oh, did the party finish already?\r\nKofuki: ...Of course not! Besides, you're the one who invited me, so why aren't you there!?\r\nTsugumi: ...?\r\nKofuki: What're you looking all confused for! If someone invites you somewhere, you'd expect them to go too!\r\nTsugumi: By any chance, were you looking forward to going to the party with me?\r\nKofuki: That's not... Whatever, I give up. Anyway, you're going to play with some aradama-chan, right?\r\nKofuki: Then I'm going with. It'll sure beat some lame party!\r\nTsugumi: You've changed, you know, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: I don't want to hear it from you of all people. You were bouncing up and down when you got that new sample before.\r\nTsugumi: Fufu, how perceptive of you.\r\nKofuki: I can figure out that much.\r\nTsugumi: You can? That's a little surprising.\r\nKofuki: So, where's the aradama-chan at? Let's go already.\r\nTsugumi: Don't be in such a rush. There should be enough aradama for the two of us tonight, probably.\r\nKofuki: The elite guard have been hogging them all day, so I wanna fight some as fast as possible. Got it?\r\nTsugumi: That's more typical behavior for you. Why don't we get to it then?"}, {"paste_key": "3gfipzTT", "title": "A Big Brawl!

They're looking excited, aren't they?\r\nKaoru: Well yeah. Exams just finished, and it'll be Christmas soon. They're all getting into it.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nEllen: Awww~...\r\nKaoru: What's with you? Normally you'd be all \"Christmas!\" and dancing around.\r\nEllen: Christmas is the problem! Hear me out, Kaoru.\r\nEllen: This year, everyone in my family has some other important business stopping them from getting together on the 25th...\r\nEllen: This was my chance to be with everyone, and I was really looking forward to it.\r\nEllen: Aww... Now I'll be spending Christmas all by myself.\r\nKaoru: Fine, since it's Christmas, I'll celebrate with you. Though it sounds like a lot of effort.\r\nEllen: Kaoru...! Friends have to stick together, right! We should start getting things ready for Christmas right now!\r\nKaoru: But I'm tired.\r\nEllen: Come on, let's go!\r\nKaoru: O-Oi, you don't have to pull so hard.\r\nEllen: First off, we should think of where to order the cake from.\r\nEllen: Ah, for the main course, instead of chicken, why don't we do it like in America and roast a turkey?\r\nKaoru: The two of us aren't gonna be able to finish a whole turkey...\r\nEllen: I just can't wait to spend Christmas with you, Kaoru.\r\nKaoru: That's my phone... I don't want to answer.\r\nEllen: Is it Sana-sensei? If you don't, it'll be worse later.\r\nKaoru: Fine... Hello?\r\nKaoru: Huhh? Hang on! I only just got back here!\r\nEllen: What's wrong? Kaoru?\r\nKaoru: I'll be on expedition duty Christmas day... Ughh.\r\nEllen: But... What about getting ready for our fun Christmas together!?\r\nKaoru: I can help you get ready for a lonely Christmas at least... I can't believe how hard they're overworking us...\r\n???: Ughhhh... Why is this happening to me.\r\nEllen: Come on, Kaoru. No matter how bad things are, don't you think you're laying it on too thick?\r\nKaoru: That wasn't me just now.\r\nEllen: Then, who...\r\nMihono: ......\r\nKaoru: That one.\r\nEllen: Yep, there's no mistaking that gloomy face.\r\nKaoru: Should we talk to her?\r\nEllen: Let's do it!\r\nKaoru: Oiii, what's wrong? You look upset about something.\r\nMihono: Oh, Ellen-san, Kaoru-san.\r\nEllen: I can't help but worry when I see you looking depressed, MihoMiho.\r\nMihono: Well... You see...\r\nMihono: I failed my exams... When I think about how the winter break I've been waiting on is gonna be filled with makeup classes and more exams, I can't help but be depressed...\r\nKaoru: That sounds pretty...\r\nEllen: ...Heavy, huh.\r\nMihono: This'll be my saddest winter break ever...!\r\nKaoru: I know how you feel... We should get to decide how to spend our own break!\r\nEllen: Instead of a white Christmas, it's looking like we'll all be having a black Christmas...\r\nPassing Toji A: Isn't Christmas coming up? Do you have any plans?\r\nPassing Toji B: Ahaha, of course I don't.\r\nPassing Toji A: Then, have you heard about that Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle they're doing on Christmas Eve?\r\nPassing Toji A: The one where the winner gets a reward from the head of the family.\r\nPassing Toji B: Nobody told me. What reward?\r\nPassing Toji A: They're saying you can wish for anything, and the head of the family will make it happen.\r\nPassing Toji B: Seriously!? That's Yukari-sama for you, I guess. I'll think about it.\r\nMihono & Ellen: ...!?\r\nEllen: I'm going to ask for more information! You two just wait right here-!\r\nMihono: If what they were saying is true... Then there's still hope!\r\nKaoru: Well, nobody wants to spend Christmas studying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Unified Christmas Mock Battle\r\n\r\nEllen: Getting right to it, both the Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle and Yukari-sama granting any wish are real!\r\nMihono: That's crazy!\r\nEllen: It's just limited to anything Yukari-sama can make happen.\r\nMihono: But that means Yukari-sama could cancel out my failing grades and makeup classes, right!?\r\nEllen: That's what it means. Yukari-sama's so generous.\r\nMihono: Then I might be able to win back my fun filled winter break... Probably!\r\nEllen: That's the spirit, MihoMiho!\r\nMihono: I should tell Chii-nee and the others about the mock battle!\r\nEllen: I think they're going to officially announce it soon.\r\nMihono: Oh, okay. So what are we supposed to do to win, anyway?\r\nEllen: They said they're going to announce that on the day of the mock battle.\r\nKaoru: If they're granting any wish, there's going to be a lot of people getting worked up over it.\r\nEllen: That's right, that's why I need you getting worked up over it too, Kaoru!\r\nKaoru: Sure.\r\nNene: Nene-!\r\nEllen: We might both end up rivals in the mock battle, but let's both do our best to get that Christmas present, MihoMiho!\r\nMihono: I'm not planning on losing!\r\n\r\nSayaka: Chew chew... Your cookies are always good. I like them.\r\nMai: I'll make more for you. Oh right, why don't we hold a Christmas party together? I can make you more than just cookies.\r\nSayaka: Mm... I'll look forward to spending Christmas together.\r\nSayaka: But... I can't help you get ready for the party.\r\nMai: You didn't have to worry about that, but why?\r\nSayaka: The day before Christmas, there's going to be a unified mock battle. President Takatsu told me to win it.\r\nMai: I have friends who are joining that too. The winner is supposed to get their wish granted by Yukari-sama.\r\nMai: I know you're strong, Sayaka-chan, but don't push yourself too hard.\r\nSayaka: Mm. If I got hurt, I wouldn't be able to spend Christmas with you. I'll be careful.\r\nMai: Okay, please do. So then, do you know what you want to wish for?\r\nSayaka: The president only told me to fight. It's like a mission.\r\nMai: Hmm... You should think up something, in case you win.\r\nMai: Something you want, or want to try doing.\r\nSayaka: I'll think about it. Thank you, Mai.\r\nMai: You don't have to thank me. But if there's anything you want from me, just ask, okay?\r\nSayaka: I want another cookie.\r\nMai: In that case... Here, say \"ahhh\".\r\n\r\nMaki: This Five Traditions Unified Mock Battle we're holding... It could be a good chance for toji to improve their technique and sense of awareness.\r\nMaki: But, I don't think there'll be a winner.\r\nYomi: I agree. Considering the victory condition, it's very difficult.\r\nMaki: We'll have to do everything we can to make sure this mock battle goes off without a hitch.\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the 24th of December. The day of the Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle has arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: An Out of Place Christmas Tree\r\n\r\nMaki: Silence-! Yukari-sama is about to explain the purpose of today's mock battle. Please, go ahead.\r\nYukari: To begin with, I want to apologize for making this announcement so shortly before the event begins.\r\nYukari: To all of you students, tomorrow you will be entering your winter break, sure to be a time of festivities as we enter the new year.\r\nYukari: However, for all of you toji, I would like for you to once more engrave your duty deeper into your minds. To that end, I have hosted this Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle.\r\nYukari: Though, I don't mean to be so strict with you today. I promise that, whoever can come out the victor of this mock battle, I will grant any wish I can make possible.\r\nYume: Basically, that makes Yukari-sama your Santa Claus this year~!\r\nYukari: ...Indeed, though my clothes aren't nearly as red, and I have hardly as many presents to reward you with.\r\nYukari: That will be all from me. There are those among you who won't participate in this assignment, but I hope you feel mutually encouraged by those aiming for victory.\r\nMaki: Now then, I'll be going over the rules and victory condition.\r\nMaki: First, to explain how we will decide the victor, I'd like for you all to look at the top of this tree.\r\nMaki: Do you see the star mounted on top? Whoever can take that star will be our winner.\r\nMai: So there was a practical reason for that big tree.\r\nSayaka: I just thought it was there to look pretty.\r\nMaki: You can defeat your rival toji first, or aim right for that shining star.\r\nMaki: But, those rivals won't be your only obstacle. Protecting that star will be--\r\nYume: Hiii, it's me and Suzuka onee-san!\r\nSuzuka: Yume, Maki-san was in the middle of her explanation.\r\nYume: Ehhh, but she was just gonna introduce us, so what's the difference?\r\nSuzuka: Sigh... Maki-san, please continue.\r\nMaki: Putting it simply... If you can't pass the defenses of the second and fourth seat of the elite guard, you won't be getting that star.\r\nMaki: And as far as time goes, you have until 10pm to accomplish that. That does it, as far as basic rules go.\r\nYomi: In addition, I will go over responding to any aradama that appear during the mock battle.\r\nYomi: In the case of an aradama's appearance, dealing with it will be our top priority. Of course, taking the star at that point will not count.\r\nYomi: Please do not forget your duty as toji.\r\nMaki: Then, Suzuka, Yume.\r\nMaki: Starting now, the Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle will begin-!\r\nYume: All of you can come at once, you don't have to be shy you know-?\r\nOrdinary Toji A: They might be the elite guard, but there's only two of them... If we all rush them, someone will be able to break through for sure!\r\nOrdinary Toji B: We don't have to beat them either... So long as one of us can grab that star--\r\nOrdinary Toji C: Let's all go together-!!\r\nYume: Too easy. I can't even call that a warmup~. If that's all you've got, you're just gonna annoy me making me fight you.\r\nSuzuka: You shouldn't speak to them like that. This is an exercise in improving their technique. You need to face them as proper opponents\r\nYume: Fineee. You can take a break, you know, Suzuka onee-san.\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, I'm afraid I can't accept that offer, but I'd welcome seeing you try your best, Yume.\r\n\r\nMihono: Nobody said I was gonna have to fight the elite guard for this!?\r\nChie: Considering the reward, I expected as much...\r\nSayaka: I've confirmed the victory condition... I'll secure the star now.\r\nMai: Hang on, Sayaka-chan. Why don't we wait and see how things play out first?\r\nSayaka: Understood. I know I can rely on you at times like this, Mai.\r\nEllen: Hmmm~, looks like we're really going to have to work to make this happen. But, so long as you're here Kaoru, I know we can do it!\r\nKaoru: I'm really losing interest in this whole wish granting thing though. It suddenly became a pain in the ass... Ahh, I could be eating kanpyo rolls under a kotatsu right about now.\r\nEllen: Just forget about everything else, and let's challenge ourselves a little!\r\nNene: Ne-ne! Ne-ne!\r\nKaoru: Alright, you win, but just a little.\r\nEllen: Now then. How do we go about getting past Yumecchi and HanaHana...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Distant Star\r\n\r\nMock Battle Participant A: Kyaa...!?\r\nSuzuka: You're all being far too careless.\r\nMock Battle Participant B: Wait... When did she-!?\r\nMock Battle Participant C: How are they this strong...\r\nSuzuka: No matter how many you bring, you won't reach the tree without a proper plan.\r\nYume: Aww, I thought I was gonna get to play with those onee-sans!\r\nSuzuka: You were dealing with another group, weren't you, Yume?\r\nYume: I wanted to count how many I could play with at the same time.\r\nSuzuka: Why exactly do you think we're here...\r\n\r\nMihono: The elite guard might be a huge wall in the way, but I'm not about to give up on Christmas and winter break... Mmmm, what do I do...?\r\nChie: It's true... Those two are unbelievably strong. But you don't have to defeat them. You only have to worry about getting the star from the tree.\r\nMihono: Oh yeah! If I don't have to beat them... Then getting out of makeup classes isn't just a dream!\r\nChie: That's right... With the right strategy, you might still win. Though, I'd be okay with helping you study for your exams, you know?\r\nMihono: If I can help it... I don't want to study!!\r\nChie: Honestly, as your onee-san, I'd rather you studied instead. But I promised I'd help you with this.\r\nChie: We'll just have to put our heads together and figure out how to get that star. \"Where there's a will, there's a way\", right?\r\nMihono: Yeah! Where there's a will, there's a way...!!\r\nChie: That's my Mihono-chan.\r\nKofuki: So you two were doing all that yelling. A will and a way's not gonna help you beat the elite guard.\r\nMihono: I know, but... Then you help too, Fukki!\r\nKofuki: Don't wanna. Call me when there's aradama-chan to fight instead of toji.\r\nChie: But I think if you helped us, our chances of winning would be much higher, Kofuki-chan.\r\nKofuki: I'm on standby. You guys can handle that mock battle yourselves.\r\nKofuki: Besides, Chichie, you baby Mihocchi way too much. I mean come on, her wish is getting out of makeup classes...\r\nMihono: ...Ughh!\r\nChie: You might be right, Kofuki-chan.\r\nMihono: ...Chii-nee.\r\nChie: But even so, if Mihono-chan is in trouble, I want to be there to help her. I'm her onee-san, after all.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee!\r\nChie: O-Oh... Mihono-chan... When you hug me like that... It's a little awkward.\r\nMihono: ...Ehehe. I made up my mind, there's no way I'm not getting that star!\r\nChie: Fighting those two directly will be tough, but I'll try to give you an opening.\r\nKofuki: ...Whatever, I won't be a third wheel. Ahh, when are there gonna be some aradama-chan around here.\r\n\r\nEllen: The star feels so so high up and far away.\r\nKaoru: I thought that Yume was obsessed with fighting, but even after teasing her she won't move away...\r\nEllen: And even if you did, HanaHana's still there.\r\nEllen: But still, we can't just keep hiding back here. Let's go get a close up look at the enemy!\r\nKaoru: I'll give it a shot.\r\nYume: Ahaha! You came out of nowhere, right from my blind spot! That's more like it!\r\nEllen: You're going to hurt my feelings, acting so casual about my surprise attack~\r\nKaoru: D'yaaah!\r\nSuzuka: At last, some opponents worth fighting have arrived.\r\nSuzuka: Though, doesn't that okatana give you trouble in close quarters?\r\nKaoru: Well, that much is obvious. But it doesn't matter.\r\nSuzuka: I see, so you're betting on her to win then?\r\nEllen: Yes, I'm here to take your star!\r\nYume: Nooope, I won't let you do that, Onee-san-!!\r\nYume: Haaaah-! I'll send you flying-!!\r\nEllen: Oh...! Combining that move with hachimanriki! Nice, Yumecchi!\r\nYume: Fufu~, seeya next time, Onee-san~!\r\nKaoru: Alright, time to retreat.\r\nNene: Nene!\r\nSuzuka: ...Huh!?\r\n\r\nKaoru: She launched you pretty far. You okay?\r\nEllen: I'm fine, thank you. I like when you get worried, Kaoru.\r\nKaoru: So, what do you think?\r\nEllen: They made some changes to the way they fought against us.\r\nEllen: Yumecchi's speed is an issue, but it seems like they're fighting to keep us away from the tree.\r\nKaoru: If they can't beat someone in one hit and a long fight breaks out, it must get a lot harder protecting the star.\r\nEllen: So it probably makes their job easiest if they keep using hachimanriki to bounce us away.\r\nEllen: Feels like Yumecchi is on top of her game today. This could be a real piece of work.\r\n\r\nYume: Geez-! Why'd they run after I only knocked her away one time-! That's so boring!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Various Desires\r\n\r\nYume: Sayaka-chan, play~ with~ me~!\r\nMai: Sorry, I'll be your opponent instead!\r\nYume: Nn~, then I'll leave Sayaka-chan for later. How long do you think you can keep up with me, Onee-san?\r\nSuzuka: If you're challenging me too, then I'll face you the same as the others.\r\nSayaka: Fighting you isn't my goal. So...\r\nSuzuka: Well, of course it wouldn't be. But--\r\n\r\nMai: In the middle of our fighting, I tried to lead Tsubakuro-san away from the tree. But it was no use.\r\nSayaka: Tsubakuro Yume moved a little away. It wasn't a bad plan, Mai.\r\nMai: I think Konohana-san... No, Tsubakuro-san too, they realized what we were doing. If I were on the defending team, it would never be a good idea to move far from the tree.\r\nMai: Maybe we should have tried a more direct offense before.\r\nSayaka: We won't be able to take the star that easily.\r\nMai: That reminds me, Sayaka-chan. Have you decided what you'll wish for when you get the star yet?\r\nSayaka: I forgot to think about it. My wish... What I want to do, what I want.\r\nMai: That's right. Yukari-sama seems like she would be able to make anything possible.\r\nSayaka: ...I thought of it... I want to eat Mai's cookies.\r\nMai: But Yukari-sama could ask a high class bakery to make you some delicious sweets. Why not ask for that?\r\nSayaka: No, I want yours. When I think about getting to eat the tasty cookies Mai made, I feel like I can work even harder.\r\nMai: In that case, I'll bake you the most delicious cookies I've ever made, I promise.\r\nSayaka: Mm, I want to try that.\r\nSayaka: But, to get that star, we can't just fight those two.\r\nMai: That's right. Why don't we look for an opportunity as we see how they move to intercept? We're sure to find an opening somewhere.\r\nMai: Hm?\r\nSayaka: What is it? Mai?\r\nMai: Tsubakuro-san, she left the tree? What are they planning... A trap?\r\n\r\nYume: Come onnn, nobody strong is showing up! This is too boring! Ever since the start, we've only been getting weaklings!\r\nSuzuka: You knew this would happen, though. There are few toji capable of entertaining you out there.\r\nYume: Well there was Sayaka-chan and some others, but they won't fight me for real.\r\nSuzuka: They seem to be coming up with their own plans.\r\nYume: I got it! Since I'm bored, I'll see if Maki onee-san will play with me!\r\nSuzuka: I supposed this might happen. I'll handle things while you're gone.\r\n\r\nYume: Hey, hey, fight me, Maki onee-san! I was about to die of boredom over there~.\r\nMaki: You know we can't do that now. You and I both have our duties here.\r\nYume: Boo. You just have to stay near Yukari-sama!\r\nYume: Ah! I just thought of something good. Yukari-sama~? If I can protect the star, I want you to grant my wish!\r\nMaki: That's already an important role Yukari-sama gave you. Don't start acting greedy with it.\r\nYukari: No, if that will keep Yume motivated, I'll allow it. If you can keep the star untouched, I'll grant your wish.\r\nYume: You mean it!? Hooray-! I wonder what I should wish for~?\r\nYomi: Wasn't that nice of her, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Yeah! It's my Christmas present~, my Christmas present~!\r\nYume: (Come to think of it, doesn't something happen around Christmas?)\r\nYume: ...Ah! It's Yomi onee-san's...!\r\nYume: (Yomi onee-san's birthday! I remember hearing it's on Christmas Eve!)\r\nYomi: My... What?\r\nYume: It's nothing, nothing at all-!\r\nYume: (I'll make Yomi onee-san all surprised by giving her a birthday present out of nowhere~!)\r\nYume: (What should I get for her~. What would make Yomi onee-san happy...)\r\nYume: !!\r\nYume: Hey, hey, Yomi onee-san, you love rice, right? You were eating a lot of rice balls the other day.\r\nYomi: ...Yes. Though, why are you asking?\r\nYume: No reason, I just remembered is all.\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYume: I should get back to the tree now! Nobody's gonna get that star from me, just you watch~.\r\nYukari: Yume is looking especially motivated now.\r\nMaki: You made the right call, Yukari-sama.\r\nYomi: Yes. Now it will be harder than ever for those participating to take that star.\r\nYukari: We can't say for sure how things will end. Let's watch as the toji show us how they've grown.\r\n\r\nYume: No matter how many times you try, it's gonna be the same, you know~? I won't go easy on you.\r\nSuzuka: You seem to be rather excited about your work now. Did something happen?\r\nYume: Yukari-sama promised me, if I can keep the star from getting taken, she'll grant my wish too~!\r\nSuzuka: Then I'll need to do my best to make sure your wish comes true, Yume.\r\nYume: Thanks, Suzuka onee-san!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Christmas Memories\r\n\r\nChie: Now's your chance, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Okay!\r\nYume: Are you thinking you can take me cause Suzuka onee-san's busy with other people? That's a little disappointing.\r\nChie: I'm not taking you lightly. But you can't win without risking it!\r\nSuzuka: No matter who you are, I won't be allowing you through.\r\nMihono: ...So fast! Even though she already had her hands full.\r\nChie: I won't let you stop her-!\r\nYume: You can't go getting distracted like that, Onee-san.\r\nChie: Eh?\r\nMihono: ...Chii-nee!\r\nMihono: Phew... I made it!\r\nYume: Ooh, that was a pretty good move! I wasn't expecting you to step in~.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee... Let's get out of here for now!\r\nChie: Ah...\r\n\r\nMihono: I grabbed your hand pretty hard back there. Was I too rough?\r\nChie: ...You didn't hurt me at all.\r\nMihono: You know, I'm sorry I dragged you into this on Christmas Eve, Chii-nee...\r\nMihono: Tsubakuro-san and Konohana-san were on us in a second. It put me in a cold sweat...\r\nChie: No, thank you for saving me. I'm supposed to be your onee-san... But I'm no help.\r\nMihono: What are you saying, Chii-nee? You're always helping me out.\r\nChie: Thank you. Maybe it's because of how you took my hand then, but you reminded me of when we were kids.\r\nMihono: Did something like this happen before?\r\nChie: I was about to start crying, and... You came straight over and led me away by the hand. It was just like this; you were a real hero of justice.\r\nMihono: I was? I think I remember something like that, but...\r\nMihono: But still, lately you really feel like an onee-san, Chii-nee. You're nothing like you used to be. And you help me out all the time.\r\nChie: It makes me happy to hear you say that, Mihono-chan. I mean it.\r\nMihono: You know, now that we're thinking back, remember that time when you were in elementary school and we had a Christmas party at your house?\r\nChie: I do. And I remember you were so excited that you dropped your cake on the floor. You got so upset over it.\r\nMihono: W-Well I was just a kid back then...!\r\nMihono: But then, you cut your cake in half and gave me some.\r\nChie: I think I was trying to act a little more like your onee-san.\r\nChie: You keep running into trouble, Mihono-chan, so I want to be there more for you to rely on me.\r\nChie: Besides, Christmas cake doesn't taste as good when you're eating it by yourself, right?\r\nMihono: Yeah! It was only half, but I remember it being really yummy.\r\nChie: Look at us, getting lost in the past. Why don't we come back to the present and think about how we're going to get that star down?\r\nChie: I want to spend another good Christmas with you this year, after all.\r\nMihono: For sure! I'm counting on you, Chii-nee!\r\nChie: You can help think too, Mihono-chan.\r\n\r\nChie: Because the members of the elite guard protecting the tree are stronger than expected, there are less and less toji trying for the star. Meanwhile, it's becoming easier for them to guard it.\r\nChie: In short, I think many people have given up already.\r\nMihono: Maybe that's why. Konohana-san worked through the people she was already fighting quicker than I thought, so...\r\nMihono: But, I also think it's a good thing there are less rivals now.\r\nEllen: I see you still haven't given up, MihoMiho. If only Kaoru could learn from that side of you.\r\nChie: Does that mean Kaoru-san quit already?\r\nEllen: Unfortunately, yes. It sounds like she's too tired from being on so many expeditions.\r\nMihono: She must have been on a lot...\r\nMai: Oh, you're here, Ellen-chan.\r\nEllen: I was waiting for you, MaiMai, Saaya.\r\nSayaka: Ellen, what did you want to talk about?\r\nMihono: Huh? What's going on?\r\nEllen: Fufufu~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Until You Get the Toji Star!\r\n\r\nEllen: We're holding a combined strategy meeting to settle this once and for all!\r\nMihono: Ooh!\r\nEllen: To start with, why don't we all share what happened the times we tried getting that star?\r\nEllen: When Kaoru and I made our move, I was going to use jin'i and hachimanriki to reach the top, but Yumecchi saw it coming.\r\nEllen: Kaoru was keeping HanaHana busy at the time. How did things go for you when you went up against those two?\r\nChie: You can be sure that if you take your attention off them for a moment, they'll be closing in.\r\nChie: If Mihono-chan wasn't there to protect me... I'm sure Tsubakuro-san would have taken me out.\r\nEllen: How about you, MaiMai?\r\nMai: Konohana-san keeps a close eye on Tsubakuro-san, and is always ready to follow up and coordinate with her.\r\nSayaka: It's hard to take the star while being Tsubakuro Yume's opponent. You don't get to focus on anything else.\r\nEllen: You're right about that. It feels like to push through their defense, I'd need another helping hand or two.\r\nSayaka: The time limit is also approaching.\r\nMihono: Then it sounds like we need to have everyone here fighting together?\r\nEllen: That's a nice idea, but everyone here wants the star for themselves, right?\r\nMihono: ...Oh yeah.\r\nEllen: That's going to make everyone joining forces sort of difficult.\r\nChie: That's true. I don't have a wish of my own, but I promised Mihono-chan I would help her with hers.\r\nMai: I'm sort of the same way.\r\nEllen: If we try our hardest, I'm sure things will turn out for the best for one of us.\r\nEllen: Let's all work hard and not worry about who's going to win!\r\n\r\nYume: Fufu~. It's looking like I'll be the one getting the star after all.\r\nSuzuka: You shouldn't have said that, Yume. Now they're here.\r\nMai: Hyaah-!\r\nYume: I'll play with both of you at once!\r\nSayaka: I'm going to take the star.\r\n\r\nChie: While they attack from the front, we'll move in from the other side.\r\nSuzuka: You didn't think it would be that easy, did you?\r\nChie: Mihono-chan, I've got this... And Tsubakuro-san is also...!\r\nMihono: Thanks, Chii-nee!\r\nSuzuka: I'm more than capable of handling the two of you as well.\r\n\r\nEllen: (Everyone's started making their moves.)\r\nEllen: (Even though we said we wouldn't work together, attacking in waves would be the most effective option.)\r\nEllen: (Hmm, Yumecchi should be better for this than HanaHana.)\r\nEllen: If only Kaoru were here, I could calm down and enjoy myself some more.\r\n\r\nEllen: Yumecchi! Don't you want to play with me?\r\nYume: Hmph... I'm a little busy playing with Sayaka-chan and this other onee-san right now, so come back later!\r\nEllen: But that's no good; I want to play with you now.\r\nYume: I told you, go away!!\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan!\r\nSayaka: !\r\nYume: Don't go anywhere, Sayaka-chan! I'll deal with this onee-san later... Haaah-!!\r\nEllen: ......\r\nSuzuka: (She's grinning? To begin with, why would she come to take Yume's attack head on like that?)\r\nSuzuka: (That's right... When she fought her last time, Yume used hachimanriki like this to knock her... Ah!)\r\nSuzuka: You can't do that... Yume! If you hit her away--\r\nYume: Huh?\r\nEllen: Just like I wanted, thanks a bunch!\r\nEllen: If I bounce up the tree with some help from hachimanriki, the star's right in my reach.\r\nEllen: Kohagura Ellen's got the star in her hands!\r\nMai: She actually used the kickback from being struck by Tsubakuro-san...\r\nSayaka: Ellen's amazing.\r\nMihono: Awww... I don't believe it.\r\nYume: That's not fair, big boobie onee-san!\r\nEllen: Ooph! It's perfectly fair. I put all my faith in how strong you are, Yumeechi!\r\n\r\nMaki: The winner is Kohagura Ellen. With this, the Five Traditions Unified Christmas Mock Battle comes to a close.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Ellen's Wish\r\n\r\nMai: That's too bad, huh.\r\nSayaka: Ellen's tactics won. I wanted those cookies, but I had fun fighting with you, Mai.\r\nMai: Fufu, don't worry. I'll still make you cookies and a cake for Christmas.\r\nMai: I know it isn't much compared to Yukari-sama granting you anything. But it's my Christmas present to you for trying so hard, Sayaka-chan.\r\nSayaka: I'm excited for tomorrow.\r\nYume: Boo. We almost made it...\r\nSuzuka: She did find a clever way to win, but it's frustrating nonetheless.\r\nYomi: I think you two fought well.\r\nYume: But I wanted to ask Yukari-sama to give Yomi onee-san a year's worth of Akita rice for her birthday present-!\r\nMaki: ...Yume.\r\nSuzuka: So that's what you were thinking about.\r\nYume: I just wanted to give her a present.\r\nYomi: It would be difficult to accept a year's worth, but thank you, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: You don't have to thank me, I couldn't even get you anything.\r\nYomi: That's not true... I'll make you some kiritanpo to eat, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Kiritanpo on Christmas? Ahaha, that's really weird-!\r\nYomi: If there's a kind of rice you like, please tell me. If not, I will choose a rice from Akita.\r\n\r\nKaoru: Yo, winner.\r\nEllen: Where have you been all this time?\r\nKaoru: So, what are you gonna wish for?\r\nEllen: For Yukari-sama to give you a vacation on Christmas. That's all I want!\r\nEllen: You can think of it as my Christmas present to you.\r\nKaoru: Huhh? You're the one who won. Use it for yourself.\r\nEllen: You could have just accepted it. But I love when you're considerate like that, Kaoru.\r\nKaoru: I'm just stating the obvious. Come on, isn't there anything else you want?\r\nEllen: Hmmm... Let's see. I only want to spend a nice Christmas together with you, so...\r\nEllen: ! I just had a good idea!\r\nEllen: I'll ask for a Five Traditions Unified Christmas Party. That way, everyone can have a good time together!\r\nKaoru: Why not, it sounds like fun.\r\nEllen: Is that okay, Yukari-sama?\r\nYukari: A Unified Christmas Party? It's short notice, but that won't be a problem. I'll begin the preparations.\r\nYukari: The elite guard will take charge of responding to any aradama incidents that may happen tomorrow.\r\nYume: No matter what aradama show up, you know I'm enough to beat them alone, Yukari-sama.\r\nMaki: We'll do as you order, Yukari-sama. The elite guard doesn't object.\r\nYukari: With that settled, tomorrow we will host the Five Traditions Unified Christmas Party.\r\nEllen: Kaoru gets the day off, and we get to spend Christmas together. It's two birds with one stone!\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nEllen: Normally in America we spend it with our families, but I heard in Japan you spend it with the person you love, so this year I'll try a Japanese style Christmas!\r\nEllen: Because you're the person I love, Kaoru!\r\nKaoru: Uh, when they say that, it's actually supposed to be more like a romantic thing... ...Well, fine. I get the day off, so I'll go along with it.\r\nMai: It sounds like Yukari-sama is hosting a Christmas party instead.\r\nSayaka: If Mai's going, I'll go too.\r\nMihono: ......\r\nChie: There's going to be a big Christmas party, Mihono-chan. So cheer up.\r\nMihono: The party sounds like fun, but... Makeup classes won't be.\r\nChie: I can't go to class for you, but I'll be right there helping you get ready for your exams.\r\nChie: That way, you should still be able to find some time to have fun over the break, right?\r\nChie: So let's forget about that for now and enjoy tomorrow's party, okay?\r\nMihono: WAAAAHH! I'm so lucky I have you, Chii-nee... No, you're all I have left, Chii-neeee!\r\nChie: Oh... You're exaggerating, Mihono-chan. There, there.\r\nKaoru: Looks like you made the right call with the party.\r\nEllen: Fufu, I'm glad you think so. Still, those two sure are close, aren't they."}, {"paste_key": "ACpZaMzA", "title": "Complete Your Day Off Mission!", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/ACpZaMzA", "timestamp": "", "hits": "91", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZFiQs-1TKo\r\nCovers both fall events.\r\n\r\n1: The Elite Guard's Time Off\r\n\r\nMaki: Everyone, the mission schedule for this month is ready.\r\nYume: Got it! Are we doing anything interesting this time? Hurry up and let me see, Maki onee-san!\r\nSuzuka: Last month we had fairly packed schedules; it was hard enough to find half a day to rest. How does it look this time?\r\nMaki: It's another pretty busy month, but it's arranged so each of us gets full days off at least.\r\nMaki: I'll send you all the data so you can go over it yourselves.\r\nYomi: Thank you.\r\nSuzuka: It's true, there's just enough gaps between missions for some time to ourselves.\r\nYume: So I get this day off, and this one too~? Huh? Suzuka onee-san, don't we have the same day off?\r\nSuzuka: Would you look at that; that's quite the coincidence.\r\nYume: Then, we should go play somewhere together!\r\nSuzuka: I'd be glad to. It's rare for our time off to match up like this, so we should take advantage of the opportunity.\r\nYume: I can't wait~! Maki onee-san, and Yomi onee-san too, if you have the same day off you should come with us!\r\nMaki: Well, there's no way our schedules would line up that conveniently...\r\nMaki: That's strange, I have the same day off...\r\nYomi: I do too...\r\nYume: Hooray~! Now we can all go out together! This is the best! This is the best!\r\nMaki: We never get the same day off like this, so what happened here...?\r\nSuzuka: Yukari-sama must be planning something.\r\nYume: Don't think so hard about it, onee-sans~! We all got the day off together, so we should just have fun with it.\r\nYomi: In any case, I'm going to confirm with Yukari-sama that this wasn't some mistake.\r\n\r\nYukari: All of you have the same day off?\r\nMaki: Yes. Since we don't get much time off, I'd think all of us getting the same day would never happen.\r\nSuzuka: I was wondering if you were planning something by this, Yukari-sama...\r\nYukari: I don't recall making any specific order here. Isn't it just that all of you happened to be without missions that day?\r\nMaki: It's true that all of us should have our work done for the time being that day...\r\nYukari: Then that day is simply the most efficient time to give all of you a break.\r\nYume: See, see~? I said you were overthinking it, didn't I?\r\nYume: Oh yeah! Can you take that day off too, Yukari-sama? Then we can all have fun together!\r\nYukari: Unfortunately, I have a pile of duties steadily accumulating that need to be dealt with. You'll all have to enjoy yourselves without me.\r\nYume: Well that sucks~. But at least the four of us are together, right!\r\nSuzuka: Yes, I'm glad we could clear up that it wasn't all some big mistake at least. Though...\r\nYomi: Will it really be alright for all of us to be absent on the same day?\r\nSuzuka: We can have our time off whenever, so wouldn't it be best if we adjusted the schedule now?\r\nYume: Ehh, but I thought we were all going to go hang out together...\r\nYukari: Wait, there's no need for you to change your schedule. If you go making adjustments without good reason, it would throw other people's plans into disarray.\r\nYukari: Since you have no work to do, you should enjoy your time off. So long as you fulfill the obligations you're given, you have nothing to worry about.\r\nSuzuka: Y... Yes ma'am.\r\n\r\nMaki: ...Yukari-sama might have said all that, but I'm still not sure about this.\r\nYume: Yaaay! Yukari-sama said it's okay, so we're all gonna go play together, right!\r\nSuzuka: Well, we did get approval from Yukari-sama... And it would be nice for all the elite guard to spend time together.\r\nMaki: You're right, you never know if we'll see another chance like this.\r\nYume: Alright-! So let's think of where we're going!\r\nYomi: ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: You Have the Day Off?\r\n\r\nOn the day everyone had off--\r\n\r\nYume: Maki onee-san, Suzuka onee-san! They're starting the line for the roller coaster! We should get up in front.\r\nSuzuka: Don't run like that, Yume. It's dangerous.\r\nYume: I'll be fine-! Who do you think I am!\r\nMaki: There sure are a lot of people who came to the amusement park today, aren't there?\r\nSuzuka: I know, it's already so crowded. If only Yomi had come along with us...\r\n\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYukari: Hm? Yomi, don't you have the day off?\r\nYomi: Yukari-sama. Good work. Is something wrong?\r\nYukari: To begin with, Yomi, I'm talking about you. What are you doing here?\r\nYomi: Yes, I was doing my usual duties, reviewing paperwork that needs to be settled...\r\nYukari: I'd heard Maki and the others went to an amusement park. You didn't go with them?\r\nYomi: They did invite me, but I remembered I still had paperwork to take care of.\r\nYomi: Approved, unapproved... Approved...\r\nYukari: That paperwork, it's not something that needed doing right now, was it?\r\nYomi: No...\r\nYukari: Then, on your day off, when your comrades invited you out, why would you refuse them and force yourself back to work?\r\nYomi: That's because...\r\nYomi: Yukari-sama. I appreciate your consideration for allowing all of us to take the day off at once... However, I can't bring myself to leave the Origami household without any members of the elite guard.\r\nYukari: Is that something you discussed with the others before deciding?\r\nYomi: No... They looked so happy planning where to go on their day off that I couldn't bring it up, so I told them I remembered I still had work left to do.\r\nYukari: I see. Yomi, your devotion to your duties is one of your admirable qualities, however...\r\nYukari: How about this. I have an assignment for someone as dedicated as you that needs to be taken care of today.\r\nYomi: Understood, I'll do whatever you ask of me.\r\nYukari: In that case, take the day off at once.\r\nYomi: Eh...?\r\nYukari: Making use of the breaks in your work to rest is an invaluable part of self-management. Your mission today is to enjoy your day off to the fullest.\r\nYomi: But, Yukari-sama...\r\nYukari: Put away those papers at once, and begin your mission. That's all I have to say.\r\nYomi: Yukari-sama! ...She's gone.\r\nYomi: Yukari-sama gave me this mission, so I have to carry it out, but how...?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Yomi's Day Off\r\n\r\nYomi: Enjoy my day off to the fullest... That's what Yukari-sama told me, but what does that mean, and where could I do it...?\r\nYomi: ...\r\nYomi: Ah, that's right. If I join Shidou-san and the others, who should still be at the amusement park, Yukari-sama must be able to accept that.\r\nYomi: First, to see if joining them is still a possibility. I'll call Shidou-san.\r\nYomi: She won't pick up... In that case, someone else...\r\nYume: Hey heyyy~! Yomi onee-san? It's Yume!\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, I wanted to talk to Shidou-san...\r\nYume: Maki onee-san went to go buy some ice cream. Get this, I'm about to ride a roller coaster with Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san!\r\nYomi: I'm glad you're having a good time. When Shidou-san gets back, could you please tell her to call...\r\nYume: Ah, she's back! I'll put her on!\r\nMaki: Hello, Yomi? Sorry I couldn't get back to you. This place has been packed all morning. I wish you could've been here with us.\r\nMaki: Anyway, what's the matter? Did something come up with work?\r\nYomi: No, it's not like that...\r\nPublic Announcement: Sorry to report... ber of visitors... restricting entry... der of the day...\r\nMaki: Oh, huh...\r\nYomi: What was that?\r\nMaki: It's nothing. I was just thinking it was so crowded today, when they announced they're restricting entry from now on.\r\nYomi: They're... Restricting entry?\r\nMaki: Ah, I think Suzuka has something she wants to ask you. I'm putting her on.\r\nSuzuka: Hello, it's me. Yomi, which do you prefer, chocolates or cookies?\r\nYomi: I don't mind either of them...\r\nSuzuka: When you answer like that, it only makes this decision harder... The souvenir shop here has all sorts of delicious looking sweets.\r\nSuzuka: It's a shame you aren't with us, Yomi. We could have had fun picking them out together.\r\nSuzuka: Oh, it's our turn to get on the ride, so I'll have to hang up now. We'll buy you souvenirs on our way back, so do your best at work, Yomi.\r\nYomi: ......If they're restricting entry, I won't be able to join them at the amusement park, will I...\r\nYomi: In that case, where could I go to enjoy my day off to the fullest...?\r\nYomi: Now that I think about it, I was never taught how to spend free time... What do I do...\r\nYomi: If I look into it at the library, I might be able to find a book that can help.\r\n\r\nYomi: Ways to spend free time... Ways to spend free time...\r\nPassing Toji A: Hey, next time we get a day off, wanna stop by Harajuku?\r\nPassing Toji B: Sounds good. Harajuku it is~!\r\nYomi: (I see, Harajuku...? I remember other toji often talking about having fun during their time off there.)\r\nYomi: (If I go to Harajuku, I might find a way to enjoy my day off to its fullest. I should go now, for the sake of my mission...)\r\n\r\nYomi: Sigh, I've finally arrived. This is my first time coming here outside of suppressing aradama. It's crowded during normal hours.\r\nYomi: Now that I'm here to enjoy Harajuku on my day off... What exactly should I be doing...?\r\nYui: Heyy, good looking~! Is something bothering you? Why don't I show you a good time~!\r\nYomi: A good time? Are you talking to me?\r\nYui: Ah-! You're from the elite guard... Satsuki Yomi-san!\r\nYui: My bad! You know me, as soon as I see some cute girl I can't help myself. I had no idea you were one of the elite guard...\r\nYui: I'm really sorry about this! Anyway, I'll leave you alone now...\r\nYomi: Please wait. Weren't you going to show me a good time?\r\nYui: Eh?\r\nYomi: In that case, by all means, let me accompany you.\r\nYui: EHHHH-------------!!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Yui's Day Off Lessons\r\n\r\nYomi: That is, will you teach me the fundamentals of \"a good time in Harajuku\"?\r\nYui: You should loosen up first, Satsuki-san!\r\nYomi: I'm sorry. I don't have a good understanding of what it means to spend free time.\r\nYomi: If you don't mind, I want to join you on my day off and have you teach me how to enjoy Harajuku. Would that be acceptable?\r\nYui: Hnnng, I couldn't be happier, getting a request like that! Of course I'm okay with it! It's my lucky day, taking Satsuki-san on a date around Harajuku~!\r\nYui: I'll give you the full tour, so you can see exactly how I get the most out of Harajuku~!\r\nYomi: I'll be in your care. What should we be doing first...?\r\nYui: When it comes to Harajuku, the thing that stands out most is crepes!\r\nYomi: I've heard about those before...\r\nYui: And observing cute girls eating them!\r\nYomi: Observing...? Is that right...\r\nYui: Of course! We shouldn't waste any more time! Let's head to where they're selling some~!\r\n\r\nYui: Okay, now we'll begin our lookout in front of that crepe stand!\r\nYomi: Understood. When it comes to observing girls eating crepes, what should I be looking for specifically...\r\nYui: Just trust in your instincts, and when you see a girl who grabs your attention, look verrry closely at her behavior and expressions!\r\nYomi: My instincts... I see.\r\nYui: Ah-, that one's so cute! No, wait! Her friend next to her's good looking too~. I don't believe it, are they twins~? That's adorable~!\r\nYomi: Stare...\r\nYui: So what do you think, Satsuki-san? Can't get enough of those glittering \"Which crepe should I eat\" eyes, can you~?\r\nYui: Just seeing that is enough to keep me coming back to Harajuku!\r\nYomi: I see, their eyes were glittering? Understood, I'll focus on that point from now on. Is there anywhere else I should pay attention to...\r\nYui: Let's see~, for example... Like if you see a cool looking girl suddenly start passionately explaining the appeal of chocolate mint, while she licks away at it!\r\nYui: Getting to see that kind of gap in attitude is the real thrill of coming to a crepe stand!\r\nYomi: The enjoyment of witnessing the moment schoolgirls categorize their tastes, contradicting your expectations... Am I understanding it?\r\nYui: Mmm~, you don't have to make it sound so complicated, or even really understand it. Just so long as it makes you feel good, it's all alright!\r\nYomi: To be honest, I can't seem to find the same excitement in this as you can, Yamashiro-san. But in order to make a meaningful report to Yukari-sama, I'll try my best.\r\nYui: Ahaha, you're so weird, Satsuki-san! I know! To celebrate us meeting up today, how about I buy you a crepe?\r\nYui: Sorry that took a minute. Here you go! I only have pocket change on me, so I had to buy the cheapest cream crepe though.\r\nYomi: Thank you for your consideration.\r\nYomi: Chew, chew... This is simple, but very delicious.\r\nYui: That's great~. I feel like I'm dreaming, getting to see Satsuki-san eating up close like this! Ahhh~ I'm being healed~.\r\nYui: This is what time off is all about! Thanks to you, I had the best vacation. Now I'm refreshed and ready to give my all starting tomorrow!\r\nYomi: (Yamashiro-san seems to have fully enjoyed her day off, but is this actually what Yukari-sama asked me to do...?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Help Arrives!\r\n\r\nYui: Satsuki-san, it's time for the next attraction: observing the girls standing in line at the bubble tea stand! Let's go!\r\nYomi: Understood.\r\nYui: You know, with the streets this packed, there's cuties every where you turn. Fun huh~.\r\nYomi: (I'm not sure if the way Yamashiro-san enjoys her day off will satisfy what Yukari-sama asked of me...)\r\nYui: Wait-! Those two cute girls that were together just now...\r\nYomi: Ah, Yamashiro-san, please don't leave me behind.\r\nYui: Sayaka-chaaan! Mai-chaaaan!\r\nSayaka: Yui.\r\nMai: Fancy running into you here.\r\nYui: I know, it's like I won the lottery today~! I'm about to start tearing up! So, so? What're you two doing in Harajuku?\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan and I had the day off, so we thought we'd go shopping here.\r\nSayaka: We drank bubble tea too.\r\nYui: Nnn~ I can't get enough of it~ This \"girls day out\" feeling! I can't believe I also managed to run into you two today~.\r\nSayaka: Also...?\r\nYomi: Good, I caught up with you. Yamashiro-san, why did you run away?\r\nSayaka: Satsuki Yomi...\r\nYomi: Yanase-san and Itomi-san.\r\nMai: You two are an unusual pair. What were you up to?\r\nYomi: Today, I was having Yamashiro-san teach me meaningful ways to spend my day off.\r\nSayaka: Teaching you how to spend your day off...?\r\nYui: Satsuki-san said she wanted to know how to have fun in her free time, so I'm coaching her in my way of enjoying Harajuku to the fullest~.\r\nMai: Coaching? What did you teach her? I want to know too.\r\nYui: Stuff like sitting in front of a crepe stand and observing the cute girls going by!\r\nSayaka: Observing...?\r\nYomi: I learned to watch a person's eyes as they make purchases. And that it's essential to measure the gap in deviation between a person's style and their tastes.\r\nYui: There's no better way to spend your day off than joining a cute girl to watch cute girls, don't you think~?\r\nMai: I-I guess that's one way to spend it...\r\nSayaka: Satsuki Yomi, did you have fun doing that?\r\nYomi: I'm diligently trying to. But I'm still unfamiliar with spending time off.\r\nSayaka: I don't think... That's how people normally spend their day off.\r\nYomi: That isn't normal?\r\nYui: Huhhhh? You're kidding? I do this stuff for fun practically every day though...\r\nYomi: If what Yamashiro-san does in her free time isn't normal, then what does a normal day off consist of...?\r\nYui: Satsuki-san, I'm sorry! I was having the best time with you, but I think I might've not really been all that helpful?\r\nYomi: ...\r\nMai: Um, if you don't mind, why don't the four of us enjoy ourselves together?\r\nYomi: Could I join you?\r\nSayaka: If Mai says so, we'll do it.\r\nYui: Eh, no way-! Somebody pinch me! I'm surrounded by cute girls! Forget having a good day off, I must be dreaming!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Another Helper\r\n\r\nYomi: Yanase-san, and Itomi-san too, I'll be counting on your guidance.\r\nSayaka: ...\r\nMai: To start with, why don't we wander about and look at the western clothes on sale?\r\nMai: This dress is cute, isn't it?\r\nYui: I know, right! I think it'd look good on Satsuki-san! Here, hold it up to yourself for a second!\r\nYomi: ...\r\nSayaka: Satsuki Yomi, do you not like it?\r\nYomi: The materials seem to lack durability, and the shape of the sleeves would get in the way of fighting.\r\nMai: Ah, y-you're right... I didn't think of it, from that perspective.\r\nMai: Th-Then why don't we look in that general store over there? They sell some cute and a little strange mascot accessories. It's a popular place.\r\nYui: Wow, look at this! This doll's so uglycute~! (dasakawa)\r\nYomi: Aradama!?\r\nYui: N-No! That's not what I said-! Not aradama, da-sa-ka-wa!\r\nYomi: Forgive me. To me, it sounded like you said something else.\r\nMai: I guess that's proof that your mind is always ready for action. That's the elite guard for you...\r\nYomi: ...\r\nMai: What's the matter, you're checking your phone. Is someone trying to get in touch with you?\r\nYomi: No, it's nothing important.\r\nYui: In that case, let's go to the next store! Forget about your phone!\r\nYomi: You're right. Let's go.\r\nYomi: ......\r\n\r\nSayaka: Satsuki Yomi, you checked your phone again.\r\nYomi: I feel like I might receive an urgent message...\r\nYomi: I'm sorry, it's my mission to enjoy my day off to its fullest, but aradama suppression is weighing on the back of my mind...\r\nMai: Maybe, because things are so busy here in the city, it's hard for you to feel at ease?\r\nYomi: What do you mean?\r\nMai: Everyone has different places they feel like they can relax in. In your case, Satsuki-san, if we move somewhere that's more rich with nature, you'll have a better day off, I think.\r\nYomi: I see, a place with more nature? It's true that Harajuku is so crowded it's difficult for me to calm down. I agree that we should move somewhere quieter.\r\nYui: In that case, where would be good~? When I think of cute girls in the great outdoors, it's gotta be the beach!\r\nSayaka: Yui, it's November...\r\nYui: Shoot. But I wanted to see all of you in swimsuits~.\r\nKofuki: Huh? What're you guys doing all hanging out here?\r\nYui: Whoa! Even Kofuki-san's here now! That's it! You should come mess around with us, Kofuki-san!\r\nKofuki: Mess around? I just got done doing that with some aradama-chan, so I'm headed back to Kamakura.\r\nYui: Ehhh, it's only noon. What's the harm in hanging out with us for a while~?\r\nKofuki: The harm's that I hate how packed the stations get at night. And the leaves are in their fall colors, so Kamakura gets a ton of sightseers this time of season.\r\nMai: Fall colors! That could do the trick. Why don't we all visit Kamakura and go leaf viewing?\r\nSayaka: That could be good... I agree with Mai.\r\nYui: Good looking girls under the red leaves! That's the kind of scenery you can't see any other time of year. I'm all for this plan~! What about you, Satsuki-san? What do you want to do?\r\nYomi: The Origami estate is in Kamakura, so I knew about the leaves in their fall colors. But the idea of visiting there with the intention of sightseeing is very interesting to me.\r\nMai: If we leave now, the stations shouldn't be crowded. Shichinosato-san, if it's not too much of a bother, could you show us some of the best spots to see the leaves?\r\nKofuki: Huhh? Why do I have to...\r\nSayaka: Kofuki. Please.\r\nKofuki: ...Ughhhh... Fine, have it your way. I'll show you around.\r\nKofuki: But let me say this, I'm not going anywhere near the usual tourist traps. I find some good places every now and then when I'm on missions, so that's all I'll show you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: First Fall Leaf Viewing\r\n\r\nMai: Wow, it's beautiful!\r\nSayaka: Amazing... The trees are all red.\r\nYui: Ooh~, that's crazy! It's as pretty as a painting! You know your stuff, Kofuki-san!\r\nKofuki: Right? If I say it's good, it's good. What do you think, Yomi-senpai?\r\nYomi: ..................\r\nKofuki: O-Oi, are you in there? Yomi-senpai?\r\nYomi: Ah-, excuse me! I was overwhelmed by the sight of all the leaves.\r\nYomi: This must have always been here in Kamakura, but this is the first time I've felt aware of it...\r\nYui: Gahhh~, I missed it, Satsuki-san losing herself in the fall colors! I'll get my camera ready, so please do it again!\r\nYomi: ...Even if you ask me to, it's difficult to repeat it now.\r\nYui: In front of a backdrop of autumn leavings, the seductive look of a slightly lost Satsuki-san! This works too~! A rare shot that can only be found this time of year!\r\nYui: Okay, okay~, it's your turn now, Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan! Try gathering up the leaves on the ground, and then whooshing them all up in the air~!\r\nMai: Eh? Ummm~... Like, this?\r\nSayaka: The leaves falling down... They're pretty.\r\nYomi: The ground and the air are filled with such pretty colors. It's beautiful.\r\nYui: Mmmm~, that's good, that's good~! Beautiful leaves and beautiful girls! Kofuki-san, you need to get in here too~!\r\nKofuki: No thanks, I'm fine over here!\r\nKofuki: But you know, if you guys are gonna be this happy about it, I guess it was worth getting dragged along.\r\nKofuki: Oh yeah, Yomi-senpai, you're from Renpu too, aren't you? Do you know any other good spots?\r\nYomi: That's right... There was a place I heard about during my time as a student. It should be around here.\r\nYui: Then, to thank us, you should take us there!\r\nMai: I don't think you should tell others to do things as thanks...\r\nYomi: Understood. I'll think back and try to lead you there.\r\n\r\nYomi: It should be this place.\r\nMai: Wow, it's beautiful here too.\r\nKofuki: Well what do you know, even Yomi-senpai has some good ideas!\r\nYomi: I'm glad to hear everyone likes it.\r\nYomi: Please excuse me...\r\nSayaka: Satsuki Yomi's stomach growls too.\r\nYomi: I'm sorry. Thinking back on it, the only thing I've eaten today was a crepe.\r\nMai: If I'd known we could have had a picnic together, I would have made some boxed lunches.\r\nYomi: If I'd known this would happen, I would have packed rice balls...\r\nYui: Well I thought something like this might happen! So while we were passing the shops just now, I bought some tasty looking stuff!\r\nKofuki: Hey, nice thinking!\r\nSayaka: Croquettes, senbei, dango. They all look tasty... Satsuki Yomi, which one do you want?\r\nYomi: In that case, I'll take a croquette.\r\nKofuki: I want a croquette too! The ones the shops sell here are nice and cold. You've got a good eye, Yui.\r\nYui: Yay~! I got complimented.\r\nSayaka: Chew, chew... This dango is tasty. Mai, let me try your croquette.\r\nMai: Here, you can have half. Can I try your dango too?\r\nMai: Ahh~, it's so good. Compared to eating crepes in Harajuku, this is wonderful in its own way.\r\nYomi: Yes. Eating here, surrounded by beautiful scenery, adds a different flavor than normal.\r\nYomi: I've visited this area many times while on missions, but now that I'm here on my day off, I'm finding things that make it feel like an entirely different place.\r\nSayaka: Satsuki Yomi, right now... You're enjoying your time off.\r\nYomi: ...This is what it means to enjoy your time off... I see, I think I finally understand it.\r\nYomi: Everyone, thank you for joining me today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Day Off Report\r\n\r\nThe day after their time off--\r\n\r\nMaki: Yukari-sama, thank you for giving us our day off yesterday.\r\nYukari: Were all of you able to enjoy yourselves?\r\nMaki: Yes. We met at 8:00 am outside the entrance to the Origami estate. Afterward, the three of us moved as a group to...\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san, you aren't delivering an aradama suppression report. Why don't we hand them their souvenirs before we tell them about our trip?\r\nSuzuka: For Yukari-sama, we picked out chocolate in the shape of the amusement park mascot. And for Yomi, these cookies.\r\nYomi: Thank you.\r\nYume: Yomi onee-san, let me have some of those later.\r\nMaki: Didn't you buy cookies for yourself, Yume?\r\nYume: They were too good, so I already ate them all! Anyway, let's talk about our trip~. What was your favorite part of the park?\r\nSuzuka: In my case, I won't forget the go kart competition we had.\r\nYume: Maki onee-san was stepping on the gas so hard it sounded like her kart was going to break.\r\nMaki: Y-Yume! You didn't have to tell them that!\r\nSuzuka: It was like watching a little kid, the way you kept trying to go faster.\r\nMaki: Not you too, Suzuka...\r\nYume: But I still won in the end. Next time, I wanna race Yukari-sama and Yomi onee-san too!\r\nYukari: Good, I'm glad to hear you enjoyed yourselves.\r\nYukari: How did you spend your time, Yomi? I heard you didn't go to the amusement park.\r\nYomi: Yes. I completed my mission to enjoy my day off to the fullest without incident, and have returned to make my report.\r\nYomi: The details of my report are written in this document, which you can read through if you wish.\r\nMaki: Mission?\r\nSuzuka: Report...?\r\nYukari: ...I see. You recorded not just the beauty of the scenery, but the flavor of the dango. This is a fine report.\r\nYomi: Does this satisfy your conditions for my assignment?\r\nYukari: Yes. Admiring the changing of the seasons through observing the fall leaves, and sampling the regional delicacies. I believe you fully enjoyed your day off.\r\nYume: Ehh, you went to see the fall leaves? What the heck, that's no fair that only Yomi onee-san got to go! You should've let me go with you~.\r\nMaki: Yomi, do you mind if we read through that report too?\r\nYomi: No, go ahead.\r\nSuzuka: Hmm. So this is what you meant by your mission. It sounds like it was a lovely time, going leaf viewing.\r\nMaki: Mmhm. Reading over this, it's making me wish we had gone to see it too.\r\nSuzuka: In that case, if we're lucky enough to get the same day off again, why don't we all go to see the fall colors?\r\nMaki: That sounds like a plan. Another coincidence like this could always come up, even it's unlikely.\r\nYume: When that happens, Yomi onee-san, you have to show us all the prettiest places!\r\nYomi: I will. We can all go together next time."}, {"paste_key": "qPR9zTpp", "title": "Fall's Main Event!

Great Leaf Viewing Operation Prologue\r\n\r\nWith autumn in full swing, toji of the STT have been called to action to suppress aradama appearing in a leaf viewing spot.\r\n\r\nHiyori: I can see why this spot is famous for leaf viewing.\r\nSayaka: Amazing... It's like the trees are on fire.\r\nHiyori: It takes some rude aradama to disrespect a place this beautiful.\r\nTsugumi: Well, what if that isn't the case? It's possible there are even some tasteful aradama here to enjoy the fall colors.\r\nHiyori: Ban Tsugumi, was it? You're here with us as a part of your induction training, right?\r\nTsugumi: That's right. Until not too long ago, I was often going out on missions...\r\nTsugumi: But in order to devote myself to my research, I temporarily withdrew from toji activities.\r\nTsugumi: However, with aradama incidents becoming more frequent lately, there's a shortage of manpower. I was soon ordered to return to the fighting. To put it simply, they're throwing me in the deep end.\r\nHiyori: Oi, that sounds rough...\r\nTsugumi: Well, I'm used to that sort of rough treatment. And besides, with Kitora-san here watching over me...\r\nMirja: I'm not exactly here to monitor you... However, I will be providing support as we work together.\r\nHiyori: Right, I'll be counting on you.\r\nSayaka: There they are. I'll remove them right away.\r\nTsugumi: Ah, please wait a minute. Don't you think they're acting strangely?\r\nHiyori: What are... They doing?\r\nTsugumi: They're kicking up the fallen leaves, and then covering themselves in them. Could they be playing? This is extremely interesting behavior we're seeing.\r\nSayaka: Was that a minute? I'll kill them.\r\nTsugumi: Ah... I wanted to observe them a little longer. Well, there's nothing to be done about it now, is there.\r\nTsugumi: ...Hmm? Everyone, please, look at this!\r\nHiyori: What is it? That's an unsettling pattern...\r\nMirja: It seems to be a leaf that was stuck to the aradama defeated just now.\r\nHiyori: U-Uwaah!?\r\nTsugumi: O-Ohh!? Th-Th-The leaf is wriggling around! Could this be the aradama's influence? This is a wonderfully valuable specimen!\r\nHiyori: Uh, it's giving me the creeps... So why are you looking so happy with it?\r\nSayaka: What should I do? Should I kill it too?\r\nHiyori: Uh... You too, why don't you try settling things without using your okatana for a while.\r\nSayaka: Okay. Then I won't kill it.\r\nMirja: Kohagura Ellen once told me she encountered something similar to this.\r\nMirja: They don't seem to pose any immediate danger, however, as we have no way of knowing what effects they may have on the area, it would be best if we collected any we find.\r\nTsugumi: Ah, then I'll be in charge of gathering them. If you find any more, please let me have them.\r\nHiyori: O-Okay... I'll leave you to that. With that settled, we should begin our mission.\r\n\r\nA little while after beginning their aradama suppression mission...\r\n\r\nHiyori: How are you all holding up? We could take a break.\r\nTsugumi: You're all even stronger than I thought. Thanks to your efforts, I've been able to safely focus on collecting leaves.\r\nSayaka: Tsugumi, you were very excited about collecting them.\r\nTsugumi: Of course. This is a rare find, so I thought I'd take them back with me for inspection and observation.\r\nHiyori: That's right, weren't you originally part of the aradama research department, Tsugumi?\r\nTsugumi: I was. Every day I would research aradama and worldly phenomena related to them, such as these \"red raging leaves\", in the laboratory.\r\nTsugumi: If you ever have any aradama related concerns, please don't hesitate to ask me.\r\nMirja: It isn't so much a concern, but aren't there an unusual amount of aradama in this area?\r\nHiyori: I noticed that too. And they're acting strangely.\r\nTsugumi: Ah, that reminds me, while you were working, I had the chance to speak with the people at the shrine over there...\r\nHiyori: Oi, what were you doing in the middle of a mission...\r\nMirja: Forgive me, I took my eyes off her for a moment and she was drinking tea with the priest.\r\nHiyori: You took a break to talk over tea...! W-Well, what's done is done. So? Did you learn anything useful?\r\nTsugumi: Yes. From the sound of it, in the past, four okatana were dedicated to this shrine...\r\nTsugumi: But recently they all went missing, and at around the same time the number of aradama outbreaks increased.\r\nMirja: Those okatana wouldn't happen to be \"Momiji\", would they?\r\nTsugumi: Ah, I think that was the name.\r\nSayaka: Mirja, do you know about it?\r\nMirja: Of course I do. Momiji were unsigned and their history remains unclear, but their blades were up to 60 centimeters, making them long for a wakizashi, and designed to capture the beauty of the fall colors with its...\r\nMirja: The characteristics of the sword are said to famously alter like a woman's heart or an autumn sky. Because its preferences in owners are also intensely difficult to match, receiving permission from the the Sword Administration Bureau is...\r\nMirja: I had heard that they were entrusted to the shrine here. Once we had finished our mission, I had planned to pay my respects to them, however it's disappointing to hear of their loss.\r\nTsugumi: (...She's talking so fast that I was only able to understand half of that.)\r\nHiyori: Do you think losing the okatana and the increase in aradama are connected?\r\nTsugumi: Hmm~... Hypothetically speaking, it could be a similar case to the okatana sunk off Uraga, the Akabane swords, which ended up being found within aradama...\r\nTsugumi: Do you think the cause might be that, somehow, Momiji became similarly encased in an aradama?\r\nMirja: I see. There is a tendency for other aradama to appear and group around a stronger aradama with an Akabane sword inside.\r\nHiyori: Then that would explain the increase in aradama. So that means, as we continue our mission, we could eventually recover Momiji?\r\nMirja: ...It's possible. Yes, it goes without saying, we should be doing everything possible on this mission to recover Momiji.\r\nSayaka: I understand. Every aradama I see, I'll kill.\r\nTsugumi: And just leave collecting up the leaves to me!\r\nHiyori: R-Right.\r\nHiyori: (A-Are things really going to be okay with this group...?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Fall's Main Event! Great Leaf Viewing Operation Epilogue\r\n\r\nHiyori: Good, this place is cleared out as far as I can tell.\r\nTsugumi: Good work, everyone. It's thanks to you that I managed to fill this garbage bag full of \"red raging leaves\".\r\nTsugumi: With these, my own leaf viewing is at an end.\r\nHiyori: It ended up being a pretty unsatisfying leaf viewing, didn't it.\r\nTsugumi: No, this is more than enough. When I get back, I'll have plenty of fun with these little things.\r\nSayaka: They make a lot of noise.\r\nHiyori: Mm, they don't want to settle down...\r\nTsugumi: I know, they're such lively leaves, aren't they? ...Ah, oh right, speaking of leaves. (Momiji is both the name of the sword and the word for fall leaves)\r\nTsugumi: I never expected the shrine to hand Momiji over to us.\r\nHiyori: Ahh, that's true. We'll have to thank the priest for his kindness.\r\nMirja: The Sword Administration Bureau even officially licensed it. As soon as we get back, we can appreciate them to our heart's content.\r\nHiyori: You're breathing pretty heavy, Mirja. I'm just going to say this, but don't even think about bringing Momiji out on the train.\r\nMirja: I-I wouldn't get that carried away.\r\nTsugumi: Nn? The train...?\r\nSayaka: Tsugumi, are you bringing those on the train?\r\nTsugumi: I didn't consider that. Hmmm, what to do. This is a minor public disturbance, isn't it?\r\nHiyori: Tsugumi... Sorry. I want to sit in my reserved seat and go home.\r\nMirja: If you do want to bring those with you, I think you might have to give up on taking the train.\r\nTsugumi: Maybe I can ask the conductor to let me hold them in the vestibule.\r\nSayaka: Tsugumi, good luck.\r\nTsugumi: ...You're all pretty humorless, huh.\r\nHiyori: Anyway, why don't we take in the fall colors one last time on our way back.\r\n\r\nOn a later day...\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Fufu. I finally managed to get you home, my \"red raging leaves\". It's time for some fun experiments together.\r\nTsugumi: Nn? Huh? Where did I put them...?\r\nKofuki: Yo. You're back. I baked some sweet potatoes. You want some?\r\nTsugumi: Ah, Shichinosato-san. Thank you. I'll try one.\r\nTsugumi: Oh, it's sweet and delicious. Chew, chew.\r\nKofuki: How'd that mission go? You hunt a lot of aradama-chan?\r\nTsugumi: Yes, plenty in fact.\r\nKofuki: Man-! Lucky you! I wanted to go play with 'em too.\r\nTsugumi: If you were there, you would have hunted them all down yourself and I wouldn't have gotten any training done, Shichinosato-san.\r\nTsugumi: Ah, by the way, I brought back these \"red raging leaves\" as spoils from that time... You wouldn't happen to have seen them around here, did you?\r\nKofuki: Nn? You mean all those dead leaves? They were getting annoying rustling around, so I made a bonfire and roasted these potatoes.\r\nTsugumi: PFFFFFFT---!!\r\nKofuki: The hell-! Hey, that's gross!\r\nTsugumi: I went to... Went to so much trouble... Getting them back here... My \"red raging leaves\"... And you roasted them...\r\nTsugumi: Roasted them...? Wait?\r\nKofuki: Oi, what's with you?\r\nTsugumi: (...These roasted potatoes, just how safe is it to eat them?)\r\nTsugumi: Ahem, Shichinosato-san. How many of those potatoes have you eaten?\r\nKofuki: Huh? Well, I ate one before you got here, and then there's this half of one I split with you.\r\nTsugumi: I see, I see. Ingested 1.5 units...\r\nTsugumi: Have you noticed any abnormal changes in your physical condition? Your heart beating faster, or suddenly breaking out in sweat, for example.\r\nKofuki: What? Nothing like that. I'm feeling full now, that's it.\r\nTsugumi: Okay, okay. Immediately after ingesting, no physical abnormalities have been noticed... Now then, to help your digestion, why not play with some aradama?\r\nKofuki: Yeah-! I'm all about it! Gimme the strongest one you've got!\r\nTsugumi: Understood. Then, let's get this \"Physical Test to Determine the Effects of Consuming Potatoes Roasted in Red Raging Leaves\" underway.\r\nKofuki: Nn? What's that about?\r\nTsugumi: Look, here come the aradama~.\r\nKofuki: Alright! Bring it on!"}, {"paste_key": "r8TWfnyL", "title": "Yamashiro Yui Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/r8TWfnyL", "timestamp": "", "hits": "365", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbzl6rlTElY\r\nhttps://youtu.be/a6wLA2_IHTA\r\nhttps://youtu.be/WUlpqEzhjx0\r\nhttps://youtu.be/f-Eb7Fydp_U\r\nhttps://youtu.be/pR7T3znqc5E\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Wuef7y1z6Q4\r\nhttps://youtu.be/mM0jQ11E1pE\r\n\r\n1: Let's Take This into the Bath!\r\n\r\nYui: --Ah-! Hiyori-san! Morning! You're looking as lovely as ever today!\r\nHiyori: .........\r\nYui: Huhh? Why are you glaring at me like that?\r\nHiyori: I can't stand that kind of empty flattery.\r\nYui: I'm not lying to you! I think you're beautiful, Hiyori-san! I mean it!\r\nHiyori: You go around telling that to everyone, don't you.\r\nYui: W-Well, I mean... That's because every toji is good looking!\r\nYui: And I have a disease that'll kill me if I don't compliment every girl I think is cute!\r\nHiyori: ......That's some disease. Well, it doesn't matter to me either way.\r\nYui: You're so cold to me, Hiyori-san!\r\nYui: But you know, I kind of like it when you treat me like that!\r\nHiyori: ...If you don't have anything more to say, I'm going back to my room.\r\nYui: Ehh-! Stay and talk with me for a while! I was thinking you and I could get closer--\r\nAcademy Intercom: Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--\r\nYui: Oh no, Hiyori-san! We should go together and help out!\r\nYui: And on our way there, we can talk about all kinds of things and deepen our bond with each other!\r\nHiyori: ...Third layer jin'i!\r\nYui: Hey!? Hiyori-san-!? Please don't leave me behind!! Is that how badly you don't want to talk to me!?\r\n\r\nKanami: Phew... Looks like that's mission complete!\r\nYui: Hiyori-saaaan~, I was so lonely~. Why did you run away and leave me all by myself on the way here~?\r\nHiyori: ...Oh, you were here too?\r\nYui: You didn't even recognize me!?\r\nKanami: Hey, Hiyori-chan! Even if you're joking, you can't be that rude!\r\nYui: Uuuu, not just cute, but kind on top of that. You're my angel, Kanami-chan...\r\nKanami: Eh-? U-Uh, thanks...\r\nYui: Anyway, since we worked up a sweat here, why don't we head for the baths! You've gotta come with us, Hiyori-san!\r\nHiyori: ...I know you have an ulterior motive, so I'm not going anywhere with you.\r\nKanami: What's wrong with you, Hiyori-chan! Yui-chan just wants to hang out together; she doesn't have any ulterior motive!\r\nYui: --Uh, yes I do?\r\nYui: I mean, for me, taking a bath together after a mission is the best part about being a toji.\r\nKanami: ...Huh? What do you mean...? Wait, then what's your ulterior motive...?\r\nHiyori: Kanami. In this world, there exist perverts beyond human understanding. This is one of them.\r\nYui: That's me, the pervert beyond human understanding~! Nice to meet you!\r\nKanami: Wh-Why do you look so happy being called a pervert...? I don't get it...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Yui's Little Sister\r\n\r\nEllen: Ah-! Yuiyui! I didn't think I'd run into you here!\r\nYui: Ellen-san! You're looking good again today!\r\nEllen: Oh! Thank you so much!\r\nEllen: I'm meeting Kaoru to get some parfaits from the coffee shop by the station. Do you want to join us, Yuiyui?\r\nYui: Ahh, sorry... I really want to go with you two, but my wallet's running tight this month...\r\nEllen: Your wallet...?\r\nEllen: You are getting your salary, right? Since us toji are civil servants, after all.\r\nEllen: Or did you spend it all on something big this month; is that what you mean?\r\nYui: No... I get my salary, but it's not like that...\r\nEllen: ? Do you have some kind of special circumstances?\r\nYui: .........I-I do...\r\nEllen: --Oh, sorry about that. If you don't want to talk about it, I don't want you to feel forced to.\r\nYui: ...No, I don't want to have to hide this from you, so I'll tell you about it, Ellen-san.\r\nYui: To tell the truth... My little sister has a serious illness, and the medical bills are really high...\r\nYui: So... Um...\r\nYui: It's hard getting by on just what my parents make, so whatever I get from my salary is gone right away too...\r\nYui: Sorry, you probably didn't expect me to bring up something so serious, did you...\r\nEllen: I had no idea...\r\nEllen: It's my fault for prying into it. I'm sorry about that.\r\nYui: Don't blame yourself. You didn't do anything wrong.\r\nEllen: ...That settles it! In that case, forget about the coffee!\r\nEllen: We'll go to my room instead, and we can all hang out and talk!\r\nEllen: I don't have a lot to offer, but I can make you some tea and sweets!\r\nYui: Ehh-!? You don't have to go that far; I'd feel bad if you changed your plans because of me.\r\nEllen: Don't worry about a thing! I didn't know your sister was sick!\r\nEllen: But I think it's incredible the way you're already helping to support your family, Yuiyui!\r\nEllen: And also, I'm really glad you felt like sharing that with me!\r\nEllen: So I want to know more and more about you, so we can get even closer!\r\nYui: Ellen-san... Thanks a lot!!\r\nYui: I want to get a lot closer with you too, Ellen-san!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Yui's Grades\r\n\r\nMirja: Final exams will be starting soon. Asakura Mihono, have you been preparing yourself?\r\nMihono: Mirja-san... I've been thinking. I've been working hard as a toji, so I shouldn't really have to study, right?\r\nMirja: We carry the duties of both a civil servant and a student, so neglecting your studies is out of the question.\r\nMihono: Uuuuuuuu... I thought I could get you on my side if I tried to pass it off as seriously asking for advice, but it's no use...\r\nMihono: By the way, what kind of grades do you get, Yui?\r\nYui: My grades? Aside from math, they're catastrophically bad!\r\nMihono: Really-! Thank goodness-! We're in this together-!\r\nMirja: I don't know that that's something to be happy about...\r\nMihono: But hey, why are you only good at math then?\r\nYui: Mmm, well, I use math all the time doing everyday things, so I guess I just picked it up naturally?\r\nYui: Back when I was in elementary school, I liked finding the discount stickers they use in supermarkets. I'd do the math for the prices in my head, and I just got better and better at it.\r\nMihono: Really? I like finding discounted stuff too, but I just bring them to the checkout without figuring out the price.\r\nYui: Math is useful, and it can really make life easier!\r\nYui: For example, if you're at a festival stall and they ask if you want to try the raffle, you can judge the price against the theoretical value of the prizes left over and decide if you should draw or not!\r\nMihono: Th-Theoretical...?\r\nMirja: To put it simply, it means calculating how much you stand to gain before deciding whether you should gamble.\r\nYui: Are you good at math too, Mirja-san?\r\nMirja: I am. I like to think all the scientific subjects are my forte.\r\nYui: You mean it!? If you're good at math too, it must really have been fate that brought us together!\r\nMihono: I saw Mirja's test results before, and it's not just math. She gets good grades in every science subject...\r\nYui: That doesn't change the fact that she's good at math though! The minor details don't matter here!\r\nYui: Let's cut right to the chase, Mirja-san! Why don't you come back to my room, and we can passionately talk about math alone together!?\r\nMirja: I have the feeling I'm in danger, so I refuse.\r\nYui: Th-This can't be happening... I managed to ruin my big chance because of the way I'm always acting...\r\nMihono: Yui-chan... So you know how bad you act, huh...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Protective Handkerchief\r\n\r\nMai: I've thought this for a while, but that handkerchief with the little chicks on it you always have on your arm is so cute, Yui-chan.\r\nYui: Thanks! Actually, my little sister, Miku, made it for me!\r\nMai: Wow, that's so nice! The stitching is so well done...\r\nYui: Ehehehe. Miku's been in the hospital ever since she was little, but she's really good at sewing~.\r\nYui: She even left a message on it, \"Onee-chan, thank you for everything\"!\r\nMai: You love your sister a lot, don't you, Yui-chan. Whenever you talk about her, your eyes light up.\r\nYui: Of course! She's my lovable little sister.\r\nYui: ...Miku loves to study, so every time I go to her hospital room there's always piles of thick books lying around.\r\nYui: Every one of them is just words words words, with no pictures anywhere. I give up on the first page whenever I try reading one.\r\nYui: ...I only heard this from the nurses, but Miku's dream is to someday be a schoolteacher.\r\nYui: Apparently, a few times a week, she gathers up the other kids who stay at the hospital like her and helps them with their studies.\r\nMai: She sounds like such a good girl.\r\nYui: And even though she's been hospitalized since she was young, she has all kinds of dreams for the future.\r\nYui: ...If her sickness gets better, she'll study a lot, then get into a good college, and fulfill her dream of becoming a schoolteacher.\r\nYui: And then she'll meet someone nice, get married, and become a good mother.\r\nYui: --But, her sickness is taking all of that away from her.\r\nYui: It's too unfair. Why'd that have to happen to such a good kid... If I could take her place, I would, but...\r\nMai: ......\r\nYui: Ah... Sorry! You were only asking about my handkerchief, but then all I could think about was Miku.\r\nYui: You know, I think aradama and illness are a lot alike. They both come out of nowhere, and they both take the futures from people who've done nothing wrong.\r\nYui: That's why I have to fight it!\r\nYui: I might not be able to make Miku better, but I can save people getting unfairly attacked by aradama!\r\nYui: To tell the truth, sometimes when I run into a big aradama, I feel so scared I want to run away.\r\nYui: But when that happens, I look at the handkerchief Miku gave me. And I imagine Miku with me, telling me to do what's right!\r\nYui: Like, \"Onee-chan, help save those people from the pain of losing their future\".\r\nYui: And then, all the people getting attacked by aradama look like Miku to me. And for Miku's sake, I'll fight off any aradama!\r\nYui: All my fears vanish, and when I swing my okatana, I feel like I could chop through every aradama in my way, like, URYAAAAA!\r\nMai: Really? So to you, that handkerchief is the ultimate protective charm.\r\nMai: I'm sure your sister is also feeling better, knowing how hard you're working as a toji for her.\r\nYui: Ehehe, I hope so!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: What's Always in My Bag\r\n\r\nKofuki: Ahh-! Practice's finally over-! Man, I'm starving now.\r\nKofuki: Kiyoka, you got anything to eat?\r\nKiyoka: I don't. We at the last of my gummies this morning...\r\nYui: Kofuki-san! If you're hungry, I've got just the thing in my bag!\r\nKofuki: Like what?\r\nYui: Tadah-! It's tako wasabi!\r\nKiyoka: --Ehhh!?\r\nYui: Nn? What's wrong, Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKiyoka: W-Why did you have tako wasabi in your bag...?\r\nYui: Well of course, that's because if I ever feel like having some, I can pull it out right away!\r\nKiyoka: B-But you're supposed to keep it refrigerated, aren't you...?\r\nYui: I keep an ice pack in there too, so it's nice and cold! Don't worry!\r\nKiyoka: You keep an ice pack in your bag!? Just for the tako wasabi!?\r\nKofuki: Hang on, it's already evening. If you put that in there before we started practice, isn't it all melted by now?\r\nKiyoka: I feel like there's bigger things to worry about than that, Kofuki-san...\r\nYui: It's fine! When we went back, I swapped it out for a new one!\r\nKofuki: Well, fine by me.\r\nKiyoka: You're okay with that...!?\r\nKiyoka: In the first place, why would you got that far to keep tako wasabi with you at all times...?\r\nKiyoka: Do you really feel like you have to eat some that often...?\r\nKofuki: Nn? What's weird about that? You keep gummies in your bag too, Kiyoka.\r\nYui: Right? It's the same thing!\r\nKiyoka: Ehhhh...? Tako wasabi and gummies aren't at all alike though...\r\nYui: But they feel the same in your mouth, don't they?\r\nKiyoka: Even if they do, everything else is completely different, isn't it...?\r\nYui: Anyway, Kofuki-san! Please try the tako wasabi I made!\r\nKiyoka: You made it yourself!?\r\nKofuki: Why's that surprise you? Mai gives out the cookies she makes all the time, doesn't she?\r\nKiyoka: She does, but making tako wasabi is on a whole different level from baking cookies...!?\r\nKiyoka: Uuu... When it comes to food, I can't get through to these two at all... Hono-chan, Chie-san, Mirja-san, help me...\r\nKofuki: --Ohh. This stuff's pretty good.\r\nYui: Isn't it! Here, you have some too, Kiyoka-chan!\r\nYui: Open wide and say ahh-!\r\nKiyoka: ...I-I'll just try one bite...\r\nKiyoka: (bite)\r\nKiyoka: ...! It's good! The octopus is fun to chew, and the wasabi gives it a nice flavor.\r\nKiyoka: I always thought of tako wasabi as something adults eat when they're drinking, but this is really tasty!!\r\nYui: See-? Now do you get why I like to have tako wasabi with me when I'm out?\r\nKiyoka: I do. Or at least, I can tell why you like it so much!\r\nKiyoka: I've never really had it before, so I had no idea it tasted so good...\r\nYui: Fu fu fu. I'm happy to turn you into a tako wasabi fan too, Kiyoka-chan-!\r\nYui: If you ever want some, come ask me anytime!\r\nKiyoka: Okay, thanks for offering! Then... Could I have another bite?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/a6wLA2_IHTA\r\nNew Year's 1: To Fulfill a Great Ambition\r\n\r\nYui: ...Pant, pant... Not good, I can't... I can't die in a place like this...\r\nKofuki: What? What are you even talking about.\r\nYui: I've been waiting, Kofuki-san! I just know you'd look great in a kimono...\r\nYui: Why aren't you wearing a kimonooo!!?\r\nKofuki: Cause putting one on's too annoying.\r\nYui: But I've been waiting so long for this... I was getting so excited I was on the brink of death...!\r\nMihono: I'm done-! Yui, Fukki-!\r\nYui: I waited, Mihono-chan! You look way too cute in that!\r\nMihono: Ehehe, thanks. Chii-nee helped put it on me.\r\nChie: Really, stop running around, Mihono-chan. What will you do if it starts coming loose?\r\nMihono: Ahh, oh yeah! Sorry, Chii-nee!\r\nMirja: I think it would be best if you remembered how to put it on yourself, so you can fix it if that happens.\r\nMihono: I-I can try, but... I'm not sure I can remember...\r\nYui: ......\r\nMirja: What is it, Yamashiro Yui?\r\nYui: Bravo-! Bravo, everyone! Could anyone else out there wear a kimono so well, nay, they couldn't!\r\nYui: ...Wait, hold on? Where's Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKofuki: She's still getting changed. She said she can't get it to fit right or something.\r\nMihono: She was still like that when we were done changing too.\r\nChie: That's true. She said she might need a little more time.\r\nYui: Hmm... So that means, Kiyoka-chan's still getting dressed all alone right now...\r\nMirja: That's how it is.\r\nYui: Guhe, guhehe. My big chance has arrived. It's time to make my dream come true!\r\nMihono: Your dream?\r\nYui: Yes, my dream! The humble Yamashiro Yui will go help Kiyoka-chan as she's getting changed!\r\nMihono: Kiyoka and Yui are pretty close, huh. Maybe I should go help her too.\r\nKofuki: She's not a little kid. One person's enough.\r\nChie: But still, is it really alright letting her go?\r\n\r\nYui: KI-YO-KA-CHWAAAN-!\u3000I'M- HERE- TO- HELP-, WITH YOUR KIMONO!\r\nKiyoka: GYAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Year's 2: It's Fine, Isn't It!\r\n\r\n[This needs a TL note. In period dramas, there's a cliched scene where the evil governor will tug the sash of a woman in a kimono, causing her to spin around as she comes undressed. You've probably seen something like it, but Yui is doing the whole act and really hamming it up.]\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan, why are you here....\r\nYui: \uff29\u2019\uff4d\u3000\uff48\uff45\uff52\uff45, \u3000\uff54\uff4f\u3000\uff48\uff45\uff4c\uff50\u3000\uff59\uff4f\uff55\uff0c\u3000\uff47\uff45\uff54\u3000\uff43\uff48\uff41\uff4e\uff47\uff45\uff44\uff0d\uff01\r\nKiyoka: Why are you talking so weird!?\r\nYui: Huff-! Huff-!\r\nKiyoka: A-Aren't you breathing a little heavy...?\r\nYui: That's just my excitement escaping through my mouth!\r\nKiyoka: Eek... Y-You're eyes are so bloodshot too... Aren't they?\r\nYui: That's just my excitement spilling out of my eyes!\r\nKiyoka: Either way, you're leaking!?\r\nYui: Thank you, kami-sama... No, GOD! Thank you, God! After all these years, today, you've made my dream come true!\r\nKiyoka: Your dream? I-I don't really understand, but... A-As you can see, I'm getting dressed now, okay?\r\nYui: And that's why I came!\r\nKiyoka: Eeh!?\r\nYui: It's okay, right, Kiyoka-chan? Since you're getting changed, it's okay, right...?\r\nKiyoka: I-I don't know what you mean, but it's not okay! I know whatever you're going to do, I'm not at all okay with!\r\nYui: It's fine, isn't it, it's fine!\r\nKiyoka: What is!?\r\nYui: Kiyoka-chan, I, Yamashiro Yui, have a dream. A dreaaam to play governor with a cute girl...!\r\nKiyoka: I didn't want to know!\r\nYui: Tugging on a cute girl's obi! Their sweet scent spreading as they spin! And she's left in an immodest state!\r\nYui: Playing governor is, GOD! Now then... Here we go!\r\nKiyoka: D-Don't... HYAAAAAAAAAA-!!\r\nYui: I'd like it if you'd shout \"Ohhh myyyy~!\" instead!\r\nKiyoka: Pant, pant... Th-That's just, too much...\r\nYui: Ahh, the way you're lying there, trying to cover your chest... Good!\r\nKiyoka: Nothing about this is good...\r\nKofuki: Oiii, are you done changing yet-? Wait, what are you getting naked for?\r\nKiyoka: Kofuki-san!\r\nMihono: Eh, you aren't finished changing yet? Hang on, I'll call Chii-nee over!\r\nKiyoka: ...I-I'm saved.\r\nYui: I wanted to keep playing a little longer, but I had my fun!\r\nYui: Kiyoka-chan, I'll help you get dressed too, okay!\r\nKiyoka: I don't want your help!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/WUlpqEzhjx0\r\n[Swimsuit 19: Start]: The Pool is Heaven\r\n\r\nYui: Tsugumi-san, want to come to the pool with me next Sunday?\r\nTsugumi: Just the two of us, Yamashiro-san?\r\nYui: You're fine with it just being you and me!? You're so adventurous, Tsugumi-san-!!\r\nTsugumi: I am not. Besides, wouldn't it be boring going to the pool with someone like myself?\r\nYui: Seriously-! I don't get it; how could a date at the pool all alone with a cute girl ever be boring?\r\nTsugumi: It's impossible to predict what will set you off, Yamashiro-san.\r\nTsugumi: ...Will anyone else be coming?\r\nYui: Uhh, as far as I've heard, there's Kanami-chan, Mai-chan, Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan...\r\nTsugumi: ...That's enough. I get the gist of it now.\r\nYui: So anyway, come to the pool with us! Or, is there some research you have to do?\r\nTsugumi: No, on Sunday, I'll be available.\r\nYui: Hooray-! Be sure to get an extra cute swimsuit ready for it, okay-!\r\n\r\nYui: What kind of swimsuit did you buy, Tsugumi-san?\r\nTsugumi: Just an ordinary one.\r\nYui: Did you really get a swimsuit just for this!? I'm so glad to hear it!\r\nTsugumi: There's nothing wrong with having a swimsuit handy.\r\nTsugumi: How much swimming do you plan on doing, Yamashiro-san?\r\nYui: You think we're going swimming!?\r\nYui: No wait, since we're going to the pool together, we should have fun with each other!\r\nTsugumi: But, isn't the purpose of a pool facility to let you swim?\r\nYui: That's what school pools are for. But we're here to enjoy the pool today!\r\nTsugumi: Enjoy it? ...I see, that is another way of looking at it.\r\nYui: That's right! And to that end, I, Yamashiro Yui! Have studied the pool to perfection!\r\nYui: What I recommend trying at this pool we're going to is the floating island attraction, Tsugumi-san!\r\nTsugumi: The \"floating island attraction\"?\r\nYui: That's right! It's an attraction featuring floating platforms in the pool that you try to cross over while dodging obstacles!\r\nYui: They have water slides and stuff too, but that sounded like the most fun to me!\r\nYui: So you should look forward to it, okay?\r\nTsugumi: It does sound like fun, doesn't it-.\r\nYui: Of course it does! I was getting so excited about it last night that I could barely sleep.\r\nYui: From the sound of things, Kanami-chan and Mai-chan got there ahead of us, so we should race on over there too!\r\nYui: I just can't calm down anymore~. The pool is seriously like visiting heaven!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Swimsuit 19: End]: This is What I Wanted to Do!\r\n\r\nYui: We've arrived at the floating island attraction! I will now explain the rules!\r\nKanami: The rules?\r\nYui: The difficulty of this attraction is designed for normal people, but we're toji!\r\nYui: That's why; don't you think we ought to make it more challenging?\r\nMai: You have a point. If it's too easy, it won't be very fun.\r\nYui: I knew you'd understand, Mai-chan!\r\nTsugumi: How exactly do you plan on making it more challenging though?\r\nTsugumi: Are we going to cross it while doing a handstand?\r\nYui: A handstand!?\r\nYui: Going upside down in swimsuits on the floating islands... Everybody's bodies wobbling around... Tsugumi-san, are you a genius...?\r\nMai: Hang on, wouldn't doing a handstand on it be dangerous? We have to set a good moral standard.\r\nYui: Ugh... If that's what your conscience as a toji says, then we'll just have to go along...\r\nYui: So, like I originally planned, we'll cross the floating islands in pairs while holding each other's hands!\r\nKanami: We have to hold hands... That sounds like it would really restrict our movements.\r\nMai: Not to mention, if one person lost their balance, it would be easy for both to fall in.\r\nTsugumi: That should make for a nice adjustment to the difficulty, Yamashiro-san.\r\nYui: Sure it does; I racked my brain coming up with it. Tsugumi-san, you and I should be the first pair to go!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: ...This takes an even greater sense of balance than I realized... Whoops.\r\nYui: Watch out, Tsugumi-san! Come and lean your body into me!\r\nTsugumi: Thanks for supporting me, Yamashiro-san.\r\nYui: I should be the one thanking you hereee.\r\nYui: (The perfectly legitimate reason I invented to press up against girls on the floating islands is a huge success!)\r\nYui: (Ahh, this is bad. I'm enjoying this so much it hurts! I wish time could stop here forever!)\r\nYui: Uhehe, uheheheheh!\r\nTsugumi: What's the matter, Yamashiro-san?\r\nYui: Nothing at all, just that the wonderfulness of the pool is getting to mee.\r\nTsugumi: True, I'm having a better time than I thought I would.\r\nTsugumi: ...Yamashiro-san, thank you for asking me to come with you.\r\nYui: Tsugumi-san smiled...\r\nYui: (Wait? The mood here... If I confessed to her right now, doesn't it seem like she'd accept?)\r\nYui: Tsugumi-san, I-- PHWAGH!?\r\nTsugumi: The water hoses have started up.\r\nYui: Did you really have to give me a cold shower nowwwwww!?\r\nTsugumi: Yamashiro-san!? You'll slip on the wet platform, moving like that...\r\nYui/Tsugumi: KYAAAAAAA!?\r\n\r\nTsugumi: We failed, didn't we...\r\nYui: But, I still had a lot of fun. Let's go again, Tsugumi-san!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/f-Eb7Fydp_U\r\n[Yuusha 2 Yui: Start]: Little Sister and Big Sister\r\n\r\nYamashiro Yui has been paired with Inubouzaki Itsuki to suppress aradama...\r\n\r\nYui: It's a pleasure working with you, Itsuki-chan!\r\nItsuki: Y-Yes, thank you for working with me, Yui-san.\r\nYui: What's that, are you feeling nervous?\r\nItsuki: Yes... A little bit.\r\nItsuki: Up until now, whenever I fought aradama, it was with a lot more people, so this is my first time with just one other person...\r\nYui: You don't have to worry about a thing, Itsuki-chan. I might not look like it, but I'm super strong!\r\nYui: I'll be there for you whenever you need it!\r\nItsuki: Okay, I'll be in your care.\r\nYui: -!!\r\nYui: (Wh-What is this, this feeling...)\r\nYui: (This is different from what I feel with everyone in the investigation team... Could this be, my motherly instincts!?)\r\nItsuki: Yui-san?\r\nYui: It's nothing at all, nothing at all.\r\nYui: [inhale]... [exhale]... Okay! While we're moving around together, you can feel free to think of me as your big sister!\r\nItsuki: You'll be my big sister, Yui-san?\r\nYui: I might not look like it, but I have a real little sister, which makes me a real big sister.\r\nItsuki: If she has a big sister like you, your little sister must be having fun every day.\r\nYui: Itsuki-chan... I love you!\r\nItsuki: Thank you.\r\nYui: I want to be the best big sister I can be, so you don't know how happy it makes me to hear that.\r\nYui: That reminds me, what's Fuu-san usually like? As a fellow big sister, I'm a little curious.\r\nItsuki: What's Onee-chan like? Onee-chan, she's... She's like that.\r\nYui: Doesn't change at all, huh...\r\nYui: If she came to a different world and she's still acting the same as always, that's amazing.\r\nItsuki: Yes, Onee-chan's pretty amazing!\r\nYui: Fuhehe, you're so cuteee...\r\nItsuki: Yui-san?\r\nYui: [drool]... Oops.\r\nYui: (Control yourself! I've gotta make big sister moves in front of Itsuki-chan!)\r\nYui: Aradama!? Itsuki-chan, get ready for battle!\r\nItsuki: Right!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Yuusha 2 Yui: End]: There's No Such Thing As a Little Sister Who Hates Her Big Sister\r\n\r\nYui: YAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOOOOOOO!\r\nYui: It's a real pain with this many of them! Are you doing okay, Itsuki-chan!?\r\nItsuki: Yes, I'm fine... Kyaa-!\r\nYui: Itsuki-chan!?\r\nItsuki: I-I'm alright! More importantly... Can ask you to handle things here for a minute?\r\nYui: Sure, but... Do you have some kind of plan?\r\nItsuki: I was thinking of setting up a trap. It might not go that well though...\r\nYui: Don't worry about that at all! If it goes wrong, I'll be there to back you up!\r\nItsuki: Ah... Just now, you sounded like Onee-chan.\r\nYui: I didn't just sound like one; right now, I am your big sister! So just leave things here to me!\r\nItsuki: Please go ahead!\r\n\r\nAradama: oooo...  \r\nYui: Phew, that should be all of them. Nice work back there, Itsuki-chan!\r\nItsuki: Right, you were working hard too, Yui-san! Now we can go back to see everyone else.\r\nYui: ...Wait? Why are you holding your arm like that?\r\nItsuki: Th-That's because...\r\nYui: Something's fishy...\r\nYui: Show me your arm for a minute! --Hey, you're hurt!?\r\nItsuki: I got hurt, but this much is nothing really...\r\nYui: No matter how small it is, any injury on a cute girl is life-threatening! Let me see it!\r\nItsuki: O-Okay.\r\nItsuki: ...I didn't want to make you worry. I'm sorry.\r\nYui: You might not think it, but I'm pretty sharp when it comes to things like these. Since my little sister has a bit of an illness.\r\nItsuki: I hope she gets better soon then.\r\nYui: ...Thanks. I'd like to be able to go on trips and stuff with her someday.\r\nItsuki: You love your little sister, don't you.\r\nYui: Yeah. I bet I love her just as much as Fuu-san loves you-.\r\nItsuki: In that case, your little sister must love you even more than that.\r\nYui: Eh-, why do you think that-? I love her more for sure!\r\nItsuki: Because... There's no such thing as a little sister who doesn't love their big sister! I'm absolutely positive she love love loves you!\r\nYui: ...Well, I guess I can't beat that then. Suddenly I feel like paying Miku a visit.\r\nItsuki: I feel like going to see Onee-chan too.\r\nYui: Okay-, the aradama are dealt with, so let's hurry on back!\r\nItsuki: Right!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/pR7T3znqc5E\r\n[Misogi - Yui: Start]: A Different Possibility\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Good work, Yamashiro-san. That's all I need from you for today.\r\nYui: Wait, are you sure?\r\nTsugumi: Yes. I need to set some aside for Shichinosato-san, after all.\r\nYui: Tsugumi-san, the way you look out for Kofuki-san... It's so precious I can't get enough!\r\nTsugumi: Only you could describe aradama management as precious, Yamashiro-san.\r\nTsugumi: The reason I do this is because, if there are no aradama around, Shichinosato-san starts to get cranky.\r\nYui: Oh come onnn, isn't that what makes it so precious~? Or, are you saying you get it?\r\nTsugumi: Hmm, I can just never tell how you'll respond to anything.\r\nTsugumi: There's many types of people among the investigation team that I'm unused to dealing with, but... Yamashiro-san, you're the most extreme of them all.\r\nTsugumi: Socializing is hardly my strong suit, but there's no one I've ever had as much trouble understanding as you.\r\nYui: That sounds like an incredible appraisal of me, doesn't it!?\r\nYui: If that's how you feel, then please go ahead and learn more about me! Read me like an open book; I'll answer any question you ask!\r\nTsugumi: Ah... Then, I have one question. I realize it's a little late to ask, but, why are you helping with my research?\r\nYui: Putting it bluntly, I'm doing it for the money.\r\nYui: I get to be together with a real beauty, and I get paid to do it. Working as a toji is seriously the best job there is!\r\nTsugumi: Your expression was different before and after you said that... Was there something about it you found hard to tell me?\r\nYui: Ahaha, not at all; I love a girl who's perceptive like that.\r\nYui: ...My little sister, she's sick. That's why I need as much money as I can get.\r\nYui: But, don't you think a reason like that's sort of too heavy to bring up? I mean, when you're fooling around with girls, it's best to keep things a little lighthearted and all!\r\nTsugumi: She's sick?\r\nYui: Ahaha, I shouldn't have told you all that. Please just forget it.\r\nTsugumi: No, it's good that I was able to see a new side of you.\r\nTsugumi: And also, Yamashiro-san. The experiments you're assisting us with... Their results might one day be linked to a cure for your little sister.\r\nYui: Will they really!?\r\nTsugumi: Speaking confidentially... Research is progressing on whether or not noro can be used to cure diseases.\r\nTsugumi: In fact, there have been rumors of a successful test case...\r\nYui: This research can... But, how does it work?\r\nTsugumi: It's only a rumor, so I'm not very clear on the details. At most, it should still only be at the fundamental research stage.\r\nYui: But still! It's possible that it could save my sister... It might be able to save Miku, wouldn't it?\r\nYui: ...Hearing something like that, there's no way I can sit still about it!\r\nTsugumi: Then... You might want to go and ask the elite guard about it.\r\nYui: The elite guard?\r\nTsugumi: Yukari-sama herself is involved with this research, so the people in the elite guard may know something more.\r\nTsugumi: Though, it's considered top secret, so I'm not sure if they will tell you...\r\nYui: That's enough for me! I'm going now!\r\n\r\nYui: The elite guard...\r\nYui: I guess I'll ask Suzuka-san, since she's from Ayanokouji Martial Arts School too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Misogi - Yui: End]: Things Are Best the Way They Are!\r\n\r\nYui: Hello! Is Suzuka-san home at the moment!\r\nSuzuka: ...This isn't my home, I'll have you know. Was there something you needed?\r\nYui: Actually, there's something I wanted to talk to you about...\r\nSuzuka: If it's a love confession, I'll refrain from hearing it.\r\nYui: You mean, somebody leaked my private information about how I love Suzuka-san!?\r\nSuzuka: Well now, was that actually true?\r\nYui: Ahh, so you were just kidding with me. Here I was getting rejected before I even asked you out.\r\nSuzuka: Don't you think it's your conduct that causes you to be treated this way? So? What was it you really came to see me about?\r\nYui: ...Do you think we could talk about this someplace else?\r\nSuzuka: It seems this is a rather serious conversation. ...Come with me.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: You won't have to worry about us being overheard in here.\r\nYui: Thank you very much! To tell the truth... I heard there were experiments in treating people's illnesses with noro, and I wanted to ask you if, maybe you knew anything about it... Or something.\r\nSuzuka: --!? Where did you hear about... No. More importantly, why do you want to know?\r\nYui: Actually... Umm, this is kind of hard for me to say, but...\r\nSuzuka: ...It's about your sister, isn't it.\r\nYui: You know about her?\r\nSuzuka: It's only natural we would gather that much information. You haven't spoken to anyone else about this... Have you?\r\nYui: N-No! As soon as I heard about it, I came right here...\r\nSuzuka: In that case, forget all about it.\r\nYui: ...! B-But, they're researching it, aren't they!?\r\nSuzuka: When you have no way of knowing how long it will take before that research can be used for practical purposes, there's no point in placing your hopes on it, is there?\r\nSuzuka: Your sister is desperately fighting to overcome her illness with modern medical care, and should be gradually getting better.\r\nYui: ...\r\nSuzuka: If you have any time at all to spare speaking about this with me, you should spend it visiting her instead.\r\nSuzuka: And, you can forget all about that research. I'm sure that... Even if that method could make her better, you would only come to regret it.\r\n\r\nYui: (...What Suzuka-san said is right. But, still...)\r\nYui: (If it can make her better, no matter what method it takes, I just want her to be healthy again...)\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui!\r\nYui: Eh?\r\nAradama: KEEHHHHHH!\r\nYui: Uwah!?\r\nMirja: HAAAAAH!!\r\nYui: Th-Thanks for that...\r\nMirja: ...You aren't acting like your usual self, Yamashiro Yui.\r\nMirja: What is it you're brooding over? Isn't your cheeriness your greatest asset?\r\nYui: ...I'm sorry.\r\nMirja: If something is bothering you, why not speak about it? Telling someone else may lead to you finding the means to resolve it.\r\nYui: Then... I heard they're researching a new kind of treatment that might cure my sister. But, someone who knows a lot about that treatment told me I shouldn't place my faith in it...\r\nMirja: It's true that they say progress in the field of medical research is fierce going. However... Is that the only method that can cure your sister?\r\nYui: No... It's going bit by bit, but she really is getting better now.\r\nMirja: Is that research something that will soon be available for use?\r\nYui: Umm... I think they said, it was still at the stage of fundamental research?\r\nMirja: Then, that well informed person was right in what they said. You can't be certain of when a medical treatment still in the stage of fundamental research will be made available.\r\nMirja: This is only in regards to new forms of medicine, but... I've heard new medicines can take over a decade of research before they are made for general use.\r\nYui: It can take that long!?\r\nYui: (If that's true, then... Going the slow and steady way might actually be faster...)\r\nYui: (I can't be getting all torn up over it now; I've got to keep going at it the best I can, for Miku's sake!\r\nYui: Thanks a lot, Mirja-san! I'm past it now!\r\nYui: The girls of the investigation team really are the best there is!\r\nMirja: ...A crying child will soon be laughing, I suppose. Well, if you've recovered your spirit, then let's leave it at that.\r\nYui: Right! Yamashiro Yui's going at it in full spirit for another day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Wuef7y1z6Q4\r\n[China - Yui: Start]: The Chinatown Date I've Longed For!?\r\n\r\nTsugumi: We've safely eliminated the aradama, so while we're here, why don't we take a stroll around Chinatown until the sun starts setting?\r\nMihono: I'm all for it~! There's still a lot more shops I haven't been to yet. Do you two wanna come with me?\r\nYui: Of course I do!\u3000It's a Chinatown date with two good looking girls at my side! This makes fighting off those aradama all worth it~.\r\nYui: Date~! Date~! Chinatown date~!\r\nMihono: You're sure in a good mood, Yui.\r\nYui: You know I am! Taking a beauty like you on a date through Chinatown; that's the kind of classic date course I've been dreaming of!\r\nTsugumi: ...\r\nYui: Hm? What's up, Tsugumi-san? Ah-- Don't tell me, you're getting jealous I'm giving Mihono-chan all the attention?\r\nTsugumi: No, not once this whole time have I ever felt anything like that...\r\nYui: Then, what's that uneasy look on your face for?\r\nTsugumi: Sorry, it might be senseless of me to ask, but... I was just wondering, what is the definition of a \"date\" to begin with?\r\nYui: Tsugumi-san, you're such a serious going girl. When it comes to things like this, it's all about \"Don't think; feel!\"\r\nTsugumi: Go with your feelings without thinking... Is that it. Then, coming up with feelings regarding dating... How exactly do you do that?\r\nYui: That's easy! Right now, I'll swap between taking you and Mihono-chan on a Chinatown date with me, to give you the dating experience!\r\nMihono: The dating experience?\r\nYui: Yeah! I've spent a lot of time mentally rehearsing for the ultimate heart-pounding Chinatown date, so I'll show you a good time for sure!\r\nTsugumi: If you're that sure then, Yamashiro-san... It might not be so bad to get an experience of the real thing.\r\nYui: That's the spirit! So then, to start us off... I think I'll take out Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Ehh-- Starting with me!? If you just tell me we're going on a date like that, I don't have time to get my heart ready...\r\nYui: Don't you worry about that, Honey. I'll escort you around just right. Why don't we find somewhere to get some delicious sweets first?\r\n\r\nYui: This place sells the apricot seed soft serve that's the talk of Chinatown! I don't have much pocket money on me today, so let's share one between us. Here, open wide.\r\nMihono: Ahhn. [chew chew]... It's yummy-!!\r\nYui: Alright, now it's your turn, Mihono-chan! I'll say \"ahh\", and you...\r\nMihono: Ah, look, look! In that general store next door! They've got cute panda things you can wear!\r\nYui: Ah, wait, Mihono-chaaan!\r\nMihono: Tadahhh! Check it out! See this panda hat I got! Does it look good?\r\nYui: Mmm~! It's good; so good~! Next up, let's try this Chinese hat~! Uwah~! This one looks good too~.\r\nTsugumi: ...\r\nTsugumi: Um, would it be alright if we stopped for a moment?\r\nYui: Hmmm? What's the matter, Tsugumi-san? Hahahn~, now are you feeling jealous of me with Mihono-chan...\r\nTsugumi: That's not it. It's just that, I've started to have my doubts about all this. Eating sweets together, and excitedly shopping. It's true that it does seem like you two are having lots of fun, but...\r\nTsugumi: It also seems as if nothing has changed from when the three of us were going around together before. Can you really call this an example of a date...?\r\nMihono: You're right. It was a lot of fun, but if I had to say either way, this isn't any different from everyone hanging out together, is it-?\r\nTsugumi: Yamashiro-san, is it really fine to classify this under the definition of a date?\r\nYui: Uuu~, when you put it like that, I'm losing confidence. Could I have a little time to think this over?\r\nYui: Get ahold of yourself, Yui. Remember the strongest Chinatown fantasy date plan you fantasized about over and over day after day. Chinatown... Chinatown... When I think of an ideal date in Chinatown, it's gotta be...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[China - Yui: End]: A Practice Run!? Yui's Fantasy Chinatown Date!\r\n\r\nYui: Chinatown date... Chinatown date... When I think of situations for the Chinatown date I've been dreaming of, there's...\r\nYui: That'll do~!!!!!\r\nMihono: You look like a lightbulb went off in your head, Yui.\r\nTsugumi: She does. And, it's somewhat unsettling...\r\nYui: Anyway, let's get back into it, and swap partners! I'll need you to be play my girlfriend now, Tsugumi-san!\r\nTsugumi: (Sigh, of course it would come to this. Though, I was the one who asked what a date was to start, so I can't back out now, can I...)\r\nTsugumi: Understood. Then, please go easy on me.\r\nYui: Just leave that to me! Anyway, let's start right off by holding hands! [squeeze~]. Woww, Tsugumi-san, your hands are so soft and warm~!\r\nTsugumi: Y-Yamashiro-san! What are you doing? You got too close all of a sudden!\r\nYui: See, I remembered. When you think of a date, it means the two of you are closer than friends! That means, the two of us need to have a closeness deeper than friendship.\r\nTsugumi: Deeper than friendship... Is that so.\r\nYui: That's right! For example, if, while everyone's watching, I gave you a deep kiss!\r\nYui: And then, and then, if I took you someplace where no one's around, like a park or back alley, and when it's just the two of us, we... Ehehe... Ehehe...\r\nTsugumi: I-Is that what it means...  I think I understand the gist of it now, so don't you think we can end our fake date here?\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah. I think so too... The sun's going to go down soon too, so why don't we head home for today...\r\nYui: Ehh-, just hang on! We were only just getting started-!\r\nYui: Uuuu... Just when it was looking like we were going to get into the juicy stuff; I'm such an idiot! I should have way more stuff in my stock of fantasies that'll make girl's hearts pound-!\r\nYui: Ah-! I know! I have the strongest Chinatown date plan in history here! Hey, you two-, wait for me-!\r\nYui: I thought up the strongest Chinatown date plan! So please! Will you at least hear me walk you through it? If this doesn't make your hearts throb, then I'll take this as my loss!\r\nTsugumi: We weren't competing to see if you won or lost in the first place... But, if you're that adamant about it, we can at least hear you out.\r\nMihono: Yeah. It's fine if you're only going to talk... And plus, I'm a little curious what the strongest date plan is like!\r\nYui: Thanks so much, you two! It's that kind side of you that I love so much! Anyway, I'll get right to my presentation!\r\nYui: Our date starts off at a China dress shop in Chinatown! We put on matching dresses, and head out on the town!\r\nTsugumi: Matching China dresses... We're sticking to the assumption that this is a same sex female couple then...\r\nMihono: Still, this sounds exciting! You'd be happy to wear a cute dress, wouldn't you!\r\nYui: Right? So then, we eat some tasty food in Chinatown, and have a good time going around to all the cute general stores...\r\nMihono: That'd be fun~! But...\r\nTsugumi: Things have gone back to playing out exactly the same as before, haven't they...\r\nYui: Hold your horses-! The main event starts right here!\r\nYui: While the two of us are having a good time on our date, a group of burly thugs shows up and surrounds us, then tells you this:\r\nYui: \"Hey, pretty little thing, want to come have a good time with us...\"\r\nYui: That's when the thugs try to take you away by force. But then, I shout, \"Get your hands off my girlfriend-!\" and give the guys a high kick while I'm still in my China dress!\r\nYui: To protect the girl I love, I start pumping out stylish moves, taking down the punks one after another. And, completely captivated by me, my girlfriend says:\r\nYui: \"Thank you! I owe you my life. To make it up to you... You. Can. Have. Me...\"\r\nYui: Kyaa-! Y'know, you're a lot bolder than I thought... But, what kind of woman turns down a woman's advances! Now's not the time to hold ourselves back! And then, the two of us spend our sweet time together... Eheheheh...\r\nYui: So, what do you think? Don't you want to go on a date like that?\r\nMihono: Ummm... I want to wear a China dress, but... Everything after that is a little...\r\nTsugumi: To begin with, it's hard to imagine such a convenient group of thugs would appear at such convenient timing...\r\nYui: Come onnn... But I came up with the strongest, most exciting Chinatown fantasy date plan in history...\r\nYui: Wawah, Yui's all depressed now...\r\nTsugumi: If we were to leave her like this, it would weigh on our conscience, wouldn't it. We have to come up with something to support her...\r\nMihono: Yui, I think everybody has their own different kind of date they dream about, but I got to have a lot of fun today because you were with us! So thanks.\r\nTsugumi: That's right. And, I was able to mostly understand what the definition of a date is too...\r\nYui: You mean it!? I'm so glad~! I should be the one thanking you two! Getting to go on a three girl date through Chinatown made me the happiest girl in the world!\r\nTsugumi: A three girl date...? Can you really call an outing with three people a date? Sigh... I'm understanding the definition less and less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/mM0jQ11E1pE\r\n[Pirate - Yui: Start]: After the Mission, We're Pirates!\r\n\r\nAradama: GGGII...!\r\nEllen: --YAAH!\r\nYui: Great work as always, Ellen-san! You look so cool swinging your okatana around; I can't keep my eyes off you~.\r\nEllen: You're not going to make anything happen like that, Yuiyui. But thanks all the same.\r\nYui: Cool older girls are a treasure of their own!\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan!? There's an aradama coming after you!\r\nYui: Thanks! Nice spot, Kiyoka-chan!\r\nYui: --ORYAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nKiyoka: That should be all the aradama around here for now.\r\nKiyoka: Sigh... You made me worried because you were looking away so much.\r\nYui: Sorry, sorry. My eyes'll stay glued to you from now on, so forgive me, Kiyoka-chan!\r\nKiyoka: You're not giving me any reason to forgive you at all.\r\nYui: Eh!?\r\nEllen: Ahaha. The investigation team really gets along, don't they.\r\nKiyoka: When we first met, I never thought it would turn out like this, but we're just fine now. It's fun being with everyone.\r\nYui: Mmhmm. I love all the girls in the investigation team, so I always want to be with them wherever they go.\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan... Stalking is absolutely off limits, okay?\r\nYui: You've got it all wrong. I'll be there at all times to protect my lovable investigation team from any perverts out there. It's a great idea!\r\nEllen: You sure do come up with some unique ideas, Yuiyui.\r\nYui: I knew you'd understand! I love you, Ellen-san!\r\nEllen: Yui~. I love you too.\r\nKiyoka: E-Ellen-san... Please, for our sakes, don't encourage Yui-chan too much...\r\nEllen: It would be a good idea though, if you didn't have to worry about Yuiyui's own health and safety. But there wouldn't be any time for Yuiyui herself to rest.\r\nYui: Keeping an eye on good looking girls would fill me up with power, so I think it has a chance to work!\r\nKiyoka: There isn't one, okay? You don't have a chance.\r\nEllen: You don't miss a beat playing off each other. It's perfect.\r\nMihono: Kiyoka~, Yui~, Ellen-saaan~!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan? Are you done over there too?\r\nMihono: Yeah! Akira-san was with me and all. And Satsuki-san knew just where the aradama would be going, so it made fighting easy.\r\nMihono: --But hey, that wasn't what I wanted to talk about. The person in charge of the amusement park asked, after we're done clearing out the aradama, if we wanted to play around in the park a little!\r\nMihono: And also, with this new attraction they just started! \"The Treasures of Pirates\"! You want to try it, right?\r\nEllen: Sure we will!\r\nYui: That's the one where they lend you pirate costumes, right? Boss would probably look so good in that! I wanna see it!\r\nKiyoka: It does sound kind of fun. But, what about Kofuki-san and Juujou-san?\r\nEllen: I think they'll be fine with it, but I'll check with them just in case.\r\nMihono: Ah, thanks for that! We'll go on ahead and meet up with Akira-san then!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pirate - Yui: Start]: Captain Yui's Treasures\r\n\r\nYui: Welcome to my band of pirates, Ellen-san, Kiyoka-chan! We're going to find the treasure for sure!\r\nEllen: Aye aye sir! Captain Yui! We'll have the treasure in our hands!\r\nKiyoka: You're really getting into this, Ellen-san!?\r\nEllen: You have to go all out with this kind of thing! You should enjoy it as much as you can too, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Alright! Then... Captain Yui! What treasure are we after this time?\r\nYui: The treasures that I'm after. That'd be--\r\nYui: The fine and dashing ladies of the pirate groups Captain Suu and Captain Boss are leading around!\r\nEllen: What!?\r\nYui: You can all be under my command... Eheheheh.\r\nKiyoka: Our objective is to find treasure pendants hidden by old pirates by using our maps before the time runs out...!\r\nKiyoka: If we steal the other team's maps, we'll get points, but girls don't get us anything.\r\nYui: If we get the girls, we get the maps too! That way we get all the spoils, Kiyoka-chan.\r\nKiyoka: Okay... I get it already.\r\nKiyoka: So stealing their maps is our first goal then?\r\nEllen: Does that we won't use the clues on the map we have to find the treasure until later?\r\nYui: Yep. The maps aren't all going to be real ones, and besides, doesn't plundering sound like a real pirate thing to do?\r\nEllen: Aye aye sir! We'll plunder with all we've got!\r\nKiyoka: Uhh... Aye aye sir...!\r\nYui: Then, we're setting off!\r\n\r\nYui: Ah, I've got eyes on Captain Boss's ship!\r\nKiyoka: Captain! If we take down their pirate flag, we'll get their treasure map! Should we board them?\r\nYui: Uwahh~~~~!\r\nYuui: Mihono-chan, Boss, Satsuki-san; they're all looking so good...! Ahhh~!\r\nYui: Boss's miniskirt...! Those tempting thighs...!\r\nYui: Ah! They're boarding us!?\r\nKiyoka: Honestly... Come down from the crow's nest and protect our pirate flag, Yui-chan!\r\nYui: Aye aye sir! I'll be there to protect you, Kiyoka-chan!\r\nEllen: Alright, let's do all we can to protect our captain and pirate flag!\r\nKiyoka: Right!\r\nAkira: You two're raring to go.\r\nEllen: We're not going to go down so easy, Inagon, Yomiyomi!\r\nAkira: Well bring it on!\r\n\r\nEllen: While we were fighting, Hiyoyon and them found the treasure.\r\nYui: We might've lost, but it was still fun-! And I got pictures of everybody's pirate cosplay!\r\nEllen: You always put everything into having a good time, Yuiyui. I think that's so nice.\r\nYui: Ehehe, how about we come have fun again someday! I want to keep getting more and more treasures for myself!"}, {"paste_key": "6f6CyCvx", "title": "Welcome to the Halloween Party!", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/6f6CyCvx", "timestamp": "", "hits": "92", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUIkSASCHRk\r\nCovers both Halloween events.\r\n\r\n1: It's Nearly Halloween!\r\n\r\nKanami: Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan, hurry up!\r\nMai: Wait for us, Kanami-chan. If you keep running like that you'll bump into something. Be more careful.\r\nKanami: But I'm just so excited that we're all out shopping together.\r\nKanami: Sniff, sniff... Something smells nice. Oh, they're selling crepes! Sayaka-chan, when we're done shopping, we should get some crepes.\r\nSayaka: Mm, they look tasty.\r\nMai: They have so many flavors that it seems hard to choose just one. Sayaka-chan, pick up a menu so we can take our time thinking about it while we're out.\r\nSayaka: Okay. They all look good... Nn? Pumpkin flavor... I've never seen that before.\r\nKanami: Look, look! That store over there is selling witch costumes and magic staffs. They look really well made.\r\nKanami: Ah, those pumpkin decorations over there are cute too.\r\nSayaka: More pumpkins... Why...?\r\nMai: That's right, it'll be Halloween soon, won't it?\r\nSayaka: I've heard of that, but I've never done it. Halloween... What is it?\r\nMai: It's a day where you put on costumes, go around town collecting sweets, and eat a feast of pumpkins.\r\nSayaka: Sweets... Feast... Gulp.\r\nMai: I know. Why don't we invite all the toji to a Halloween party?\r\nSayaka: Party?\r\nKanami: That sounds fun! Let's do it, let's do it, let's throw a big party!\r\nKanami: And while we're at it, why don't we get some costumes here too?\r\nMai: That could be fun! I wonder what kind of costumes would suit everyone.\r\nSayaka: I saw a black cat costume in that store earlier. Hiyori would look good in it.\r\nKanami: Now that you mention it... A black cat would be perfect for Hiyori-chan. I want to bring it back to her as a present now.\r\nMai: If Hiyori-chan is a black cat, Kaoru-chan would be... What about a wolf?\r\nKanami: Yeah, she's look so cute like that! Now Ellen-chan has such a nice figure, so anything would fit her... I know, she could be a miniskirt nurse!\r\nMai: Isn't that just cosplay, Kanami-chan...?\r\nKanami: Ahaha, you're right. But I still think it'd look good on her.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan, what kind of costume do you want to wear?\r\nSayaka: I'll just wear what I normally do...\r\nKanami: Ehh, but you could wear all kinds of cute clothes, Sayaka-chan.\r\nSayaka: You can't dress normal to a Halloween party?\r\nMai: You can wear whatever you want. Even if it's only a party with a big feast and lots of cookies, it'll be a lot of fun.\r\nSayaka: A feast with cookies... I want to try it.\r\nMai: Really? Then I can make some delicious Halloween food for you and everyone else.\r\nKanami: A party where Mai-chan's cooking! I know everyone will want to come. You don't have to wear a costume, Sayaka-chan, so you'll come too, right?\r\nSayaka: Mm. If I get to eat Mai's cooking, I'll go.\r\nMai: In that case, we should start the party preparations straight away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Shopping for the Party\r\n\r\nMai: Sorry to make you come grocery shopping with me, Kanami-chan, Sayaka-chan.\r\nKanami: Don't worry about it! We can't make you do all the preparations for the party by yourself, you know.\r\nSayaka: Mm. Kanami and I will do anything to support the feast you're making.\r\nMai: Thank you, both of you. If there's anything you can think of you want to eat, feel free to make any requests.\r\nKanami: Allllright. Then, I want fried chicken, and sushi, and ice cream, and...\r\nMai: None of that is very Halloween-y though... But I'll try coming up with ways to make those Halloween themed.\r\nSayaka: Mai, that apple pie looks tasty.\r\nMai: It does, doesn't it? I know, how about instead I bake you a pumpkin pie?\r\nSayaka: You can make pie from pumpkins...? If Mai makes it, I want to eat it.\r\nMai: Then, could you go and get me one pumpkin?\r\nSayaka: Okay.\r\nKanami: Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan, check out these fried croquettes. Don't they look good!\r\nMai: A pumpkin croquette could work too. Kanami-chan, could you get another pumpkin?\r\nKanami: On it!\r\nKanami: Here you go!\r\nMai: With pumpkin I can make pie and croquettes, then gratin... Thanks to you two, this menu is starting to come together.\r\nSayaka: It all sounds tasty. I'll get more pumpkins.\r\nKanami: I'll help you out. We should get one for pumpkin salad, one for pumpkin gratin, one for pumpkin pudding, one for pumpkin soup... And then some more too.\r\nMai: There's so many pumpkins in the cart. They all look good, but I don't know how we can eat this much...\r\nMihono: Huh? Kanami! And Mai and Sayaka too.\r\nChie: What a coincidence. Are you shopping too?\r\nKanami: Yep, that's right.\r\nMihono: But... What's up with your cart? What are you gonna do with all those pumpkins?\r\nKanami: We were thinking of doing a Halloween party, so this is for that. Do you two think you can come?\r\nMihono: Can we? Of course I'll be there! I'm going for sure. Can I invite the others too?\r\nMai: Go right ahead! I'll look forward to having more people sample my cooking.\r\nChie: Yanase-san, does that mean you'll use all those pumpkins in cooking for the party?\r\nMai: Yes. We mostly have the menu planned out now. But if there's anything else you want to eat, tell me and I'll write it down.\r\nMihono: What, all of these? You're really going all out on this party.\r\nChie: Yanase-san, are you planning on doing all the cooking by yourself?\r\nKanami: It's a lot of work to do alone, so Sayaka-chan and I were going to help her.\r\nMihono: Wow-! You can cook too, Kanami?\r\nKanami: W-Well, I'm not that good at it... What about you, Sayaka? You've got fast hands, so you seem like you'd be a natural at cooking.\r\nSayaka: Cooking... How do you cook?\r\nChie: Fufu. Yanase-san, if it's no trouble for you, do you mind if I help cook?\r\nMai: No, I can't make you do that. I want everyone to enjoy this party, but if you're stuck helping out it defeats the purpose.\r\nChie: Don't worry about that. Besides, if you want everyone to enjoy this party, you should be having a good time too, shouldn't you?\r\nChie: If you wear yourself out doing all the cooking, you'll be too busy to enjoy the party, Yanase-san.\r\nMai: Setouchi-san...\r\nMihono: You should take her up on that, Mai. Chii-nee's cooking is super yummy, you know?\r\nMai: In that case, could I please ask you to help me get things ready?\r\nChie: Sure, just leave it to your onee-san.\r\nMihono: Nice. Between Chii-nee and Mai's home cooking, there's no way I'm missing this party!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Mai and Chie's Cooking Classroom\r\n\r\nKanami: Ahh, we're finally back... I never thought the supermarket could feel so far away from school before.\r\nMihono: Pumpkins sure are heavy. Are you really going to be able to use all these?\r\nChie: Don't worry, Yanase-san and I will be sure to turn them all into delicious food. Right, Yanase-san?\r\nMai: That's right.\r\nChie: Now then, why don't we get to work on getting these pumpkins ready?\r\nMihono: I'll lend a hand. What do you need help with first?\r\nMai: We need to cut the pumpkins for every item on the menu, so... How about this! Before we start cooking, why don't we all make jack o' lanterns?\r\nChie: Good idea, we need to scoop out the insides for cooking anyway.\r\nKanami: And it'll start feeling more like Halloween!\r\nSayaka: Mai, how do you make a jack o' lantern?\r\nMai: First, you need to cut out the bottom of the pumpkin. Then you use a spoon to pull out all the seeds and everything inside.\r\nChie: It's tough, so be careful not to hurt yourself with the kitchen knife.\r\nMihono: Okay, I can handle that!\r\nKanami: Yeah, let's give it a shot.\r\nKanami: Nngh... Ughhh, she's right. I can't get the knife through the outside...\r\nMihono: Mmghhh, I got the knife in, but I can't go any further than that... Ughh, where there's a will... There's a way!\r\nMihono: Aghhh, I give up. It's not budging an inch.\r\nSayaka: Mai, I finished cutting through the bottom. What do I do now?\r\nMai: You finished already, Sayaka-chan? Eh, that's amazing! You cut through it so cleanly.\r\nChie: You're really good at this, Itomi-san; cutting through the tough pumpkin like that.\r\nKanami: How'd you do that, Sayaka-chan? Show us your secret!\r\nSayaka: Secret?\r\nSayaka: If you use your okatana... It's easy.\r\nMai: S-Sayaka-chan...\r\nMihono: Oh yeah, I didn't think of that.\r\nKanami: Yep, with my okatana, I'm not afraid of any pumpkin! Let me try.\r\nChie: Ha-Hang on a minute. It's true that okatana are sharp, but why don't we try sticking to kitchen knives for cooking?\r\nMai: I agree! Since we have the chance, wouldn't using a cooking knife make for good practice in the future...?\r\nSayaka: If Mai says so, then I'll do it.\r\nChie: I'll help show Mihono-chan and Etou-san how, so why don't you look after Itomi-san, Yanase-san?\r\nMai: Alright. Take care of Kanami-chan for me.\r\nChie: Mmhm, just leave it to your onee-san.\r\nMai: (Setouchi-san is so reliable and wonderful...)\r\nSayaka: Mai, how should I hold the kitchen knife?\r\nMai: Let's see, when you're cutting something tough, put your hands on the back of the knife and the handle, and little by little push down using the weight of your body.\r\nSayaka: I'll try that. Nng... It's hard.\r\nMai: You're doing it, Sayaka-chan. Just like that, nice and slowly.\r\nChie: Ah, the phone. Yes, hello... Eh, there's aradama nearby? Okay, we'll be right there.\r\nMihono: Aradama? I was just getting used to the kitchen knife, but it sounds like it's time to trade it back for my okatana.\r\nKanami: Right. We should all go.\r\nChie: Wait, it sounds like there aren't many aradama this time, so there's no need for every one of us to go.\r\nKanami: Okay then. Why don't the three of us go, and you and Mai-chan can stay and cook?\r\nMihono: Sounds good to me. We'll take care of the aradama, so Chii-nee and Mai can keep cooking up that feast!\r\nSayaka: I won't lose to aradama. I'm going.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Cooking Time With Two\r\n\r\nChie: Are those carrots going in the pumpkin stew? I like the cute shapes you cut them in.\r\nMai: When they look like this, even children who won't eat carrots might eat them. My little sisters are picky, but I can get them to eat this way.\r\nChie: You're a good sister, Yanase-san.\r\nMai: I-I don't know about that...\r\nChie: I'll get the pie crust ready, so could you take the pumpkin that's in the steam cooker out and crush it?\r\nMai: Okay.\r\nChie: And, counting backwards from when we need it freshly baked, it might be better to start heating up the oven now.\r\nMai: Good idea.\r\nMai: (Setouchi-san is amazing. She isn't only good at cooking, but her instructions are perfect too.)\r\nMai: (Compared to her, I have such a long way to go... I have to pick up the pace so I'm not holding her back.)\r\nMai: Setouchi-san, I'll chop the onions for you.\r\nChie: Oh, you're so good with that knife. But you shouldn't be in such a hurry. Your eyes won't hurt as much if you give them time to recover.\r\nMai: Thank you for your concern. But, I feel fine.\r\nMai: (My eyes actually do hurt a little... But if I take a break, then Setouchi-san will get worried about me. I just need to bear with it a little longer.)\r\nChie: You really are good at this though, I mean it. It's beautiful the way you can go so fast, yet they all come out the same size.\r\nMai: Thank you very much. I use a kitchen knife every day, so I'm used to it...\r\nMai: Ow-!\r\nChie: Eh, Yanase-san, what's wrong!? Are you okay?\r\nMai: Sorry, I was just a little clumsy.\r\nChie: Did you cut yourself?\r\nMai: I'm fine. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you like that.\r\nChie: I'm just glad to hear you're okay. You don't need to rush yourself.\r\nMai: I know. Then, I'll get back to work now.\r\nMai: (Uuuu, the cut is stinging... But, it's too embarrassing telling Setouchi-san I cut myself while I was trying to show off to her, so I just have to hold it in...)\r\nChie: Yanase-san? Let me see your hand. Ah, like I thought, you're bleeding.\r\nChie: We have to take care of that, so it doesn't leave a scar. The band-aids are... Ah, there they are. I have to disinfect it now, so bear with me for a moment.\r\nMai: I'm sorry. We should be working now, but...\r\nChie: You don't have to apologize for anything. Everyone makes mistakes once in a while.\r\nMai: I really am sorry. I, I wanted to take the lead like you do, so I started working faster, but now I'm just wasting time...\r\nChie: I see. Yanase-san, I think it's wonderful the way you're always so considerate of others. There there, good girl.\r\nMai: S-Setouchi-san... You're rubbing my head...\r\nChie: Ah, I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself. You just looked so cute trying so hard, Yanase-san.\r\nChie: But, you know... When you're with me, you can let me spoil you a little. After all, I'm everyone's onee-san, you know.\r\nMai: Onee-san...\r\nChie: That's it, Yanase-san, is there something you want to eat we should put on the menu?\r\nMai: I'll eat anything, so I'm happiest just cooking the others what they want.\r\nChie: You shouldn't be so selfless. We want you to enjoy the party too, Yanase-san.\r\nChie: Can you keep it a secret between the two of us? There must be something you want to eat, isn't there, Mai-chan?\r\nMai: (Somehow... When Setouchi-chan says it like that, I feel like letting her spoil me...)\r\nMai: What I want to eat... Then, maybe hamburg steak or omelette rice. My family always tries to eat healthy, so we mostly eat Japanese dishes, but sometimes I feel like eating those.\r\nChie: In that case, I'll make a special hamburg steak for you, Mai-chan. Look forward to it.\r\nMai: Thank you so much! Chie-san.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: The Strongest Cosplay?\r\n\r\nMihono: We can't let these aradama ruin a fun Halloween. We have to beat every last one of them!\r\nKanami: Yeah. There's a party waiting for us when we get back, so let's give it our all!\r\nSayaka: We have to be done... Before the feast gets cold.\r\nMihono: Then, to keep everyone motivated, why don't we talk about ways to enjoy Halloween while we head over there?\r\nKanami: Sounds good. When you're talking about Halloween, you have to go trick or treating.\r\nSayaka: Trick or treating... I've heard of it, but what is it?\r\nMihono: It's a big event on Halloween where you put on costumes and go around to all the houses in the neighborhood, telling them if they don't give you candy you'll play a prank on them. So you threaten them like that and they give you candy.\r\nSayaka: That sounds like a dangerous event...\r\nMihono: But that danger is a part of what makes it fun; it's the thrill of Halloween. You can be a ghost, or a witch, or a zombie, and you make a really good costume and walk around town with a bunch of other people. It's so much fun.\r\nSayaka: Then, what about an aradama costume...?\r\nKanami: Good idea, Sayaka-chan. I hadn't thought of that.\r\nMihono: If you made it look real, it'd definitely scare a lot of people. That could work.\r\nKanami: Alright! Let's hurry up and see the real thing so we can get some ideas.\r\nMihono: Yeah. I'm getting fired up!\r\nSayaka: The faster I eliminate them, the faster I can eat Mai's cooking.\r\n\r\nMihono: This is the place. Huh? I don't see any aradama...?\r\nKanami: Looks like they're gone. They disappeared from the spectrum finder too.\r\nYomi: If you're looking for the aradama, we already eliminated them.\r\nYume: You onee-sans are too slowww~. I cleared them out in a snap~.\r\nYomi: I'm sorry you came all the way out here, but it's taken care of, so you're free to go.\r\nSayaka: Okay. Kanami, Mihono... Let's go.\r\nKanami: Mm, I'm just glad they were dealt with before anyone got hurt. Though... We didn't get to see the aradama up close, did we...\r\nMihono: That's right. It's a good thing everyone's safe, but I'm sorta disappointed I didn't get a good look at how they move or what they look like.\r\nKanami: Oh well, why don't we just try drawing an aradama from memory?\r\nSayaka: How will we draw it?\r\nMihono: There's a nice patch of dirt over here, so if we get a stick we can draw on the ground. Let's see, I'll start with the outline... Does that look good?\r\nKanami: Hmm, it's more jagged than that, isn't it? And the eyes would be around here, wouldn't they?\r\nMihono: No wayyy, they stick further out, right? As for the legs... How about that?\r\nKanami: Good, that's it! ...I think, but, umm...\r\nSayaka: Is that an aradama? It doesn't look like one at all...\r\nMihono: We're always fighting them, but now that I try to picture one, I can't get it right.\r\nYume: Onee-san, what're you doing?\r\nMihono: Tsubakuro-san! We were trying to remember what an aradama looks like and draw one. But it's tougher than it sounds, making it look good.\r\nYume: Why would you wanna draw an aradama~? You could be drawing something way cuter~.\r\nKanami: We were going to make Halloween costume. So we were thinking, if we dressed up like an aradama, it'd totally scare everyone.\r\nYume: Eh! A Halloween costume? That sounds like fun!\r\nYomi: Sigh...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: The Elite Guard's Halloween\r\n\r\nSeveral hours before Yume and Yomi encountered Kanami and the others, they were--\r\n\r\nYume: Why are we stuck at home again~? It's so boring~! Yomi onee-sannn, let's go play outside~.\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, remaining on alert is an important duty. As members of the elite guard, we could be called upon at any moment, so we must always be ready to act.\r\nYume: Geez~, I know that already. But it's so lame doing nothing but housesitting every single day~!\r\nYomi: Even so, we cannot abandon a mission Yukari-sama has given us without permission. Why don't you try thinking of a way to cure your boredom without going outside?\r\nYume: Something fun to do without going outside? If there were something like that, I'd...\r\nYume: Wait! I've got it! Let's have a Halloween party for the elite guards and Yukari-sama!\r\nYomi: A party...? That could be difficult. Shidou-san and Konohana-san are out on assignment every day, and Yukari-sama has very little free time.\r\nYume: Booo~, just when I had a great idea. You do something about it, Yomi onee-san. I wanna have a party~!\r\nYomi: Even if you ask me, right now, we're the only two in here. I cannot make that happen on my own.\r\nYume: Mmmm... It's only us two here...\r\nYume: Ah-! I came up with a really great idea this time! Since it's only us two here, that means we can set up a Halloween surprise!\r\nYomi: Sigh...\r\nYume: We can dress up like ghosts, and then we'll scare Yukari-sama and the others, and then they'll give us candy! It'll be a lot of fun~!\r\nYomi: Like trick or treating... You mean...?\r\nYume: Yeah, that! Since that's what we're doing, let's get our ghost costumes ready!\r\nYomi: I didn't say we were doing that... In the first place, how are we meant to find ghost costumes in here?\r\nYume: We've got all sorts of stuff we can use! Like, what if we take these curtains down and wrap ourselves up in them~!\r\nYume: Look, look, I'm a ghost~! Yomi onee-sannn, I'll put a curse on you~! But only if you don't give me candy-!\r\nYomi: ...\r\nYume: Hey, Yomi onee-san! Were you paying attention?\r\nYomi: Yes. I was watching you, but... Tsubakuro-san, do you really plan on using such a simple costume?\r\nYomi: I don't mean to disappoint you, but Yukari-sama, Shidou-san, and Konohana-san, who routinely face aradama, won't be scared by something of that level.\r\nYume: Booo~. Then, what should we use?\r\nYomi: If that's what it takes, I could prepare some actual aradama... Fufufu...\r\nYume: Wah, don't do that! When you say it like that, I can't tell if you're joking, Yomi onee-san~!\r\nYomi: Fufu, it was a joke. However, as members of the elite guard, we should be prepared to do whatever it takes to achieve our goals.\r\nYume: But I want to throw a cuter and happier party than that! Geez~! I thought it was a good idea too, but this is so boring~!\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, where are you going?\r\nYume: I'm bored, so I'm playing outside!\r\nYomi: Sigh...\r\nYume: Yomi onee-san, big news! Big news-!!\r\nYomi: You came back quickly. What happened?\r\nYume: Just now, I heard this from the girls walking outside, but the girls at Minoseki are having a Halloween party, and they're inviting everyone from the other schools!\r\nYomi: I see...\r\nYomi: (Somehow, I don't like the sound of this...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: I Want to Go to the Party!\r\n\r\nYume: We should go too, Yomi onee-san~! To the Halloween party at Minoseki~!\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, the elite guard exist at all times to serve Yukari-sama. If we were to receive orders now...\r\nYomi: Excuse me, my phone is ringing.\r\nYomi: Yes, this is Satsuki Yomi. ...Understood. We will leave at once.\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, that \"if\" has come very soon. Aradama have appeared in the nearby hills. We need to go.\r\nYume: Fufu, those are some unlucky aradama, showing up at a time like this~. I'm feeling ready to cut them to ribbons!\r\n\r\nAradama: GUAAAAAAAAA!\r\nYume: EIIIIIII!!!!\r\nAradama: OO OOOooo ooo...\r\nYume: Huhh, was that the last one? They're too weak~.\r\nYomi: That was an even more impressive display than usual, Tsubakuro-san.\r\n\r\nMihono: This is the place. Huh? I don't see any aradama...?\r\nKanami: Looks like they're gone. They disappeared from the spectrum finder too.\r\nYomi: ...!\r\nYomi: (Those toji are from Minoseki. They might be attending the party Tsubakuro-san mentioned earlier...)\r\nYomi: (In that case, it would be safest to withdraw before the topic of the Halloween party is brought up... I cannot allow Tsubakuro-san to say she wants to go.)\r\nYomi: I'm sorry you came all the way out here, but it's taken care of, so you're free to go.\r\nSayaka: Okay. Kanami, Mihono... Let's go.\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, we should leave as well. If I remember right, there's still one pudding left for a snack.\r\nYume: Really!? Then we should go home fast. Pudding~, pudding~. Huh? What are those Minoseki onee-sans crowded around? I wonder what they're doing.\r\nYume: Onee-san, what're you doing?\r\nYomi: (Ahh, she made contact...)\r\nYume: Eh! A Halloween costume? That sounds like fun!\r\nMihono: Yeah, we're going to throw a really fun party for sure. Oh yeah! Do you guys from the elite guard want to come too?\r\nYume: Can we!?\r\nYomi: Thank you for the invitation. However, it may disappoint you, but as members of the elite guard, we need to be ready at any moment in case Yukari-sama gives us an order...\r\nYume: I'll call Yukari-sama and ask!\r\nYume: Hello? Yukari-sama? I can go to a Halloween party, can't I?\r\nYomi: T-Tsubakuro-san...!\r\nYume: Don't worry, Yomi onee-san will be with me. I'll be a good girl, I promise! So can't I~? Yukari-sama, pleaseee!!\r\nYomi: Sigh...\r\nYume: Okay, got it~! Bye!\r\nKanami: What'd Yukari-sama say, Yume-chan?\r\nYume: As long as Yomi onee-san is there watching over me, she said I can go!\r\nMihono: Hooray! Satsuki-san, you'll come too, right?\r\nYume: ......Yomi onee-san, come on, come onnn! I really wanna go to the party!\r\nKanami: Satsuki-san, could you just stop by for a little while at least? If a mission comes up, we'll help you deal with it.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee and Mai are cooking up a tasty feast too. I'm sure they'd want all of you and Yukari-sama to try it, so please just stop by!\r\nYume: See, see~! They want us to come too~! So let's go~, Yomi onee-sannn!\r\nYomi: ...I understand. With Yukari-sama's approval, I'll take you up on your offer for a little while.\r\nYume: Yes-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Welcome to the Halloween Party!\r\n\r\nMai: I don't believe it! Look at all the people here.\r\nChie: Mihono-chan and the others reached out to everyone they could. Ah, there's even members of the elite guard here.\r\nMai: It's a good thing we made so much food, isn't it.\r\nKanami: Mai-chan, it looks like everyone's here.\r\nChie: Now then, everyone, may I have your attention! Right now, the organizer of this party, Yanase-san, would like to say a few words.\r\nMai: Hey, Chie-san! Where's this coming from, I can't...\r\nChie: I know how much you wanted everyone to have a good time, so this is your chance to share those feelings with them, Mai-chan. Don't worry, your onee-san is here with you.\r\nMai: O... Okay. You're right... I'll try!\r\nMai: A-All of you, thank you very much for coming to this Halloween party. Please relax and have a good time.\r\nEveryone: We will-!\r\nKanami: Whoa, look at all these pumpkin dishes! And they all look so good.\r\nMihono: Chew, chew... Y-Yummy! But it was made by Chii-nee and Mai, after all. Itomi-san, here, try a bite of this.\r\nSayaka: Chew, chew... It's good... Huh? Kanami, Mihono, you aren't wearing your costumes.\r\nKanami: Uhh... Well. We tried making them after that, right...? Hahaha.\r\nMihono: They were nowhere near ready, so we gave up on it...\r\nYume: Om nom nom! This pumpkin pudding and this stew are so good~! I wish Yukari-sama and them could have come too~, don't you, Yomi onee-san!\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, please remember your manners.\r\nYume: I know, I will~! Hey hey, Onee-san, can we bring this home with us later?\r\nMai: A jack o' lantern? I don't mind, but what do you want it for?\r\nYume: I'm gonna scare Yukari-sama!\r\nKaoru: Origami Yukari, getting scared by a pumpkin? I'd pay to see that...\r\nKaoru: Mind if we pay a visit to the Origami household?\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nYume: Sure! Everyone should come~! With enough pumpkin ghosts, Yukari-sama will really be scared~.\r\nEllen: Wow! Then, I want to see that for sure~.\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, if you don't behave in a way fitting of the elite guard, Shidou-san will be harshly scolding you later.\r\nYume: Another lecture from Maki onee-san... But I'm sorry, Yomi onee-san! Please keep this a secret!!\r\nMai: Everyone, the pumpkin pie is ready now!\r\nChie: Come get it while it's fresh from the oven.\r\nMihono: Whoa, it's huge! And it looks so good! I'll have a slice.\r\nKanami: Chew, chew... Mmm, it's delicious!\r\nSayaka: Chew, chew... Another slice. Chew, chew, chew... Another slice...\r\nKaoru: Oi, Sayaka! Eat too much and you'll get a stomachache.\r\nSayaka: Chew, chew... If it's Mai's cooking... I can handle eating any amount.\r\nMai: Thank goodness. Everyone's having a good time.\r\nChie: Fufu. It's because you're such a hard worker, Mai-chan. I'm glad too.\r\nChie: And there's something I want to show you, Mai-chan. Will you come with me for a minute?\r\nMai: What is it?\r\nChie: Here, it's a present from me to you.\r\nMai: Hamburg steak, omlette rice, and spaghetti! They're laid out in such a cute way, and they all look delicious. What's all this about? These dishes.\r\nChie: They're a reward for all your hard work getting things ready. Just a special made party platter for you, Mai-chan. Keep it a secret from the others.\r\nMai: Just for me... Is that okay? I, I haven't done anything for you, Chie-san...\r\nChie: You don't have to worry about that. After all, I'm everyone's onee-san.\r\nMai: Thank you so much! I'll have this.\r\nChie: So? How do you like it? Mai-chan.\r\nMai: Mm, it's very tasty!\r\nMai: Thank you. Chie...

That is correct.\r\nYomi: At the party, Tsubakuro-san had the idea to put a jack o' lantern on her head, and made that a part of our plan to scare Yukari-sama.\r\nYomi: To make that happen, Tsubakuro-san strongly insisted that we go get enough pumpkins for all of us.\r\nKaoru: Right, that's what I thought. ...So, does somebody want to explain to me what's going on?\r\nEllen: What do you mean, what's going on?\r\nKaoru: I mean, why're we just marching off out into the quiet countryside!\r\nYume: Because there's a pumpkin patch out here.\r\nKaoru: Huh? You're not seriously planning on borrowing pumpkins from some farmer, are you?\r\nKaoru: It's scary what goes through a middle schooler's head...\r\nYume: You don't get it~! You sure are bad at listening. The STT made a request to exterminate the aradama out here!\r\nYume: There's a pumpkin patch around here that aradama have been ruining, so we need to get rid of them.\r\nKaoru: Okay. But suppressing aradama won't make them give us pumpkins.\r\nYume: Fu fuu. You really don't get it, Onee-san.\r\nYume: Pumpkins come out of the aradama messing this place up.\r\nKaoru: Huh? ...The heck is she saying?\r\nYume: I'm telling the truth! They said it's okay if we take pumpkins that come from the aradama!\r\nYomi: I've reviewed the same request. Whatever the reason, the aradama here seem to be consuming the field's pumpkins...\r\nYomi: When the aradama are purified, the pumpkins can be recovered. However, they aren't fit for selling anymore, so we've been asked to discard of them if possible.\r\nKaoru: Huh... And you want to take those pumpkins and make jack o' lanterns to scare Origami Yukari, right?\r\nYume: That's what I've been saying this whole time!\r\nKaoru: ...You've really gotta work on your communication skills when it comes to not swinging an okatana around.\r\nYume: Eh~, what's that supposed to mean~?\r\nAradama: KISHASHASHASHASHA!\r\nYume: Spotted one already! Tou-!\r\nKaoru: Wh-Whoa... Seriously? The aradama actually dropped a pumpkin.\r\nYume: See! Just like I told you!\r\nKaoru: Nn? ...Hold up. There's something kinda wrong about this pumpkin, isn't there?\r\nEllen: What do you mean? Let me see too.\r\nEllen: Oh! It looks just like an aradama!\r\nYomi: On top of that, it's faintly glowing. Did the noro cause this?\r\nKaoru: Well... They're definitely not gonna be selling these.\r\nEllen: But these creepy pumpkins just might do the trick in scaring Yukari-sama!\r\nKaoru: Probably. I like that it saves us the effort in making anything too.\r\nYume: I know, right! Let's get a whole bunch so we can scare Yukari-sama~!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Great Halloween Surprise Operation Epilogue\r\n\r\nYume: The pumpkin's... All sticky... It won't come off... C'mon...!\r\nEllen: Yukari-sama won't be able to work in here with it covered in pumpkin guts! We should make sure her office is nice and tidy!\r\nKaoru: Sigh... Working my body outside of a mission... I feel like my guts are gonna come out too...\r\nEllen: Quit complaining and come lend a hand! It's our duty as Team Scare!\r\nKaoru: Why does it seem like you're having a lot of fun with this.\r\nYomi: I never would have thought things could turn out like this either.\r\nKaoru: Ahhh, my back... So after all that, did we actually scare Origami Yukari?\r\nYomi: I can't say for certain. After all, the moment we jumped out from the mountain of aradama pumpkins wearing jack o' lanterns, she used dragonblade*. (the name of Yukari's ougi)\r\nEllen: She didn't even let us finish shouting \"Happy Halloween!\"...!\r\nKaoru: Wasn't it right around the \"llo\" part that we ended up coated in pumpkin?\r\nEllen: I got all the way to \"wee\"!\r\nYume: But Yukari-sama didn't even twitch an eyebrow, did she? Awww, I really wanted to see her face all surprised...\r\nYomi: However, regardless of how it turned out, we still had to do a great deal of apologizing.\r\nYomi: When it comes to Yukari-sama, maybe she shows her surprise by immediately leaping into action.\r\nKaoru: Maybe you're right. Well, so long as we surprised her, I got what I wanted. I'll gladly take this punishment in that case.\r\nKaoru: ...You know, you didn't have to stay with us till the very end. I feel bad for dragging you along.\r\nYomi: You shouldn't be concerned with me. I was complicit ever since I was unable to stop Tsubakuro-san. And, besides...\r\nYomi: (Besides, I mabbe was likin it......)\r\nKaoru: Besides... What? Nn? Were you just smiling a little?\r\nYume: Ehh-!? Yomi onee-san, did you smile just now!?\r\nKaoru: Yeah.\r\nYomi: I did not smile.\r\nYume: Yomi onee-san's smiling is just as crazy rare as Yukari-sama looking surprised!\r\nKaoru: Seriously?\r\nYomi: It is not.\r\nYume: It seriously is! Aww, I wish I'd seen it~. Next time, you have to tell me when you're going to smile, okay!\r\nYomi: That's an unreasonable thing to ask of me.\r\nEllen: Pfft ahaha! Halloween sure is a lot of fun!\r\nKaoru: For sure. Now if only this cleaning would be over...\r\nEllen: That's right. Let's give it one last push!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Halloween Party Prequel\r\n\r\nOne week before the Halloween party took place...\r\n\r\nYui: Found you, Kiyoka-chan! What're you two reading that's got you all excited?\r\nMihono: Oh hey, it's Yui. Welcome back from your mission! Take a look at this!\r\nKiyoka: The Halloween party's coming up, and remember how we were all going to get costumes? Well this magazine just happened to be doing a special feature on them!\r\nYui: Ooh~, what have they got?\r\nKiyoka: I was thinking, wouldn't I look cute in this Red Riding Hood outfit!\r\nYui: ...Nice... That's nice, that's the best, Kiyoka-chan!\r\nYui: The way you understand your own type just makes me want to squeeze you tight, I mean it!\r\nKiyoka: Ahaha...\r\nMihono: There sure are a lot of different kinds of costumes though, aren't there-! This one would look so good on Chii-nee! And Mirja-san could probably wear this nurse outfit...\r\nYui: Mihono-chan, a nurse outfit isn't going far enough. Mirja-san would really make you shiver in a doctor's uniform, wouldn't she?\r\nMihono: I guess... You're right? I don't really get what you mean...\r\nYui: Ahh-! Hiyori-san has to wear this black cat costume!\r\nYui: If I saw Hiyori-san with those cat ears, I'd bury her in a mountain of candy! Ahh~, it's just too much...\r\nKiyoka: You sure have an active imagination...\r\nAcademy Intercom: Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--\r\nMihono: Eh!? Right near here!? Kiyoka, Yui! We've gotta go!\r\nKiyoka & Yui: Right!\r\n\r\nChild: Mamaaaa--!!\r\nMihono: There's a kid on the battlefield!? Everyone was supposed to get to shelter!\r\nKiyoka: Wh-What're we supposed to do...\r\nYui: I'll draw the aradama after me while you two get them to safety! I'm going!\r\nMihono: Got it! Be careful!\r\nYui: Ha... With all these after me, they should be able to get away...\r\nYui: Now I just have to... Alright. How bout I clean you up myself?\r\nYui: *Inhale*...\r\nYui: URYAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nYui: Mission complete. Though, I can't forget to call in noro recovery and make a suppression report.\r\nMihono: Yui-! We got them out of danger! -Wait, did you beat them all yourself!?\r\nYui: Did I do good-? I've gotta try my best not to get left behind by everyone.\r\nYui: And thanks for getting that kid out of harm's way, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: No way, that was all thanks to you distracting the aradama!\r\nMihono: Besides, it's amazing you managed to beat them all like that by yourself!\r\nKiyoka: Pant, pant... Sorry, I couldn't do anything to help again...\r\nYui: You took care of that kid, didn't you? You helped out plenty, Kiyoka-chan!\r\nKiyoka: But...\r\nYui: Hmm, then, how about I ask you to do something for me, Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKiyoka & Mihono: Like what?\r\nYui: You can wear that Red Riding Hood costume later, but first, you should be a mummy all wrapped up in bandages! And you'll have to take everything off! And I'll help you get changed, of course!\r\nKiyoka: Ehhhhhhh----!? I don't want to!!\r\nYui: Don't be like that, okay? Come on, Kiyoka-chan~."}, {"paste_key": "YMUfNj4Q", "title": "Spending Time at the Amusement Park, the Toji Way", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/YMUfNj4Q", "timestamp": "", "hits": "86", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfSUNS36VAs\r\n\r\n1: Maki and Suzuka's Unexpected Day Off\r\n\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOOO!\r\nMaki: Suzuka, it went that way!\r\nSuzuka: Leave it to me.\r\nAradama: OO OOoo o...\r\nSuzuka: Oh? Is that the end of them?\r\nMaki: Seems like it. I expected this to be tougher, but I'm glad we eliminated them quickly.\r\nSuzuka: We should be able to make it back sooner than planned. Since we're so far out in the mountains, let me confirm our location on my phone.\r\nSuzuka: Oh my! Maki-san, will you look at this map? On the way back to the Origami household is...\r\nMaki: Did something happen?\r\nSuzuka: Yes, something big. An amusement park!\r\nMaki: Amusement park? That's all...? Don't scare me like that.\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san, this is a rare opportunity, so would you like to go visit it together?\r\nMaki: Where's this coming from, Suzuka?\r\nSuzuka: We all need some relaxation every now and then.\r\nMaki: Ha... That's the sort of thing Yume would say.\r\nMaki: Though, we did finish our mission early, so it can't hurt. Let's go see what it's like.\r\n\r\nMaki: Hang on, Suzuka. Shouldn't we take a little break?\r\nSuzuka: Is that all it takes to tire out Shidou Maki, first seat of the elite guard?\r\nMaki: No, I still have plenty of stamina to go. But your clothes and hair are still wet from the water coaster, aren't they? Here, I'll use my handkerchief.\r\nSuzuka: Oh, you're right about that.\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, thank you very much. Your hair is wet too, Maki-san. Let me use my handkerchief.\r\nMaki: Thanks. I didn't think there'd be that much water splashing down, but the intensity of it all was exciting.\r\nSuzuka: You don't mean you were scared, do you?\r\nMaki: Of course not. I wouldn't be scared by something like that...\r\nSuzuka: You say that, Maki-san, but you were screaming so loud on the roller coaster, remember?\r\nMaki: Haha, oh, that? That wasn't fear; just my kind of etiquette.\r\nMaki: Isn't screaming on a thrill ride the highest form of respect to its creator? That's why, when I'm enjoying one, I let it all out and scream as much as I can.\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, I don't think you need to be that conscientious... But, it's quite like you.\r\nSuzuka: You know, with the two of us having a good time like this, we must look like ordinary high school girls.\r\nMaki: You're right. It's been a long while since we had the time to purely play around like this. What should we ride next?\r\nSuzuka: That's true. Next, let's get on the merry go round.\r\nMaki: You have some unexpectedly girlish tastes, you know.\r\nSuzuka: Horseriding has always been one of my specialities since I was young, so I'd like to take this chance to show my skills...\r\nMaki: Well I'd love to see that. Let's go, come on.\r\nSuzuka: Ah, you took, my hand...\r\nMaki: What's wrong, Suzuka? Your face is red. Are you feeling sick?\r\nSuzuka: I-I feel just fine.\r\nMaki: Good then.\r\nMaki: Hm? My phone's ringing. Yes, this is Shidou Maki. More aradama? Understood, we'll be right there.\r\nMaki: Suzuka, aradama have appeared in the area. We need to deal with them.\r\nSuzuka: What unromantic aradama, arriving at a time like this.\r\nMaki: If we defeat them and head right back, we should still have time to go on rides.\r\nSuzuka: That's right, let's get them taken care of!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: How Toji Enjoy an Amusement Park\r\n\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan, check it out! They have a roller coaster, and go karts, and even a water coaster!\r\nHiyori: Mai's parents are impressive, knowing the owners of such a large amusement park.\r\nKanami: I wish Mai-chan and the rest could've come with us...\r\nHiyori: Mai said she had plans with her family, so there's nothing we can do about it. And Kaoru, Ellen, and Sayaka are all on missions.\r\nHiyori: She already gave us the tickets, so we should enjoy this place to its fullest and have something good to tell Mai about later.\r\nKanami: That's a good point. We need to have enough fun for all of them!\r\nHiyori: Still, don't let your guard down, Kanami. We might be off duty, but if aradama appear, we should help deal with them right away.\r\nKanami: Yeah, of course!\r\nHiyori: Good. Then, what should we ride first?\r\nKanami: Ahaha, you're getting into it too, aren't you, Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: W-We came all this way to the amusement park, so of course we're going to ride something.\r\nKanami: You're right. So why don't we get on the roller coaster first?\r\nHiyori: Mm, that's not a bad idea.\r\nKanami: Alright! Let's go.\r\nHiyori: Oi, wait, Kanami! You're leaving me behind.\r\n\r\nHiyori: That was one intense roller coaster, especially when it went up high.\r\nKanami: Yeah. I was screaming so much my throat's sore. My eyes are all dried out too.\r\nHiyori: Nn? Your eyes are dry?\r\nKanami: While we were riding, I didn't want to blink, so I kept my eyes open the whole time.\r\nHiyori: ...Why would you do that?\r\nKanami: Roller coasters go so fast, so I figured, if I don't close my eyes, wouldn't I be able to train my dynamic vision?\r\nKanami: It'll turn into swordfighting experience, I'm sure of it! Roller coasters are so much fun!\r\nHiyori: Your idea of fun is definitely wrong...\r\nHiyori: Well whatever. What should we ride next?\r\nKanami: Why don't we go in the haunted house? It's a different kind of thrill than a rollercoaster.\r\nHiyori: A different thrill...? That sounds profound. Let's go in.\r\n\r\nHiyori: It was all bark and no bite, that haunted house.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chaaaan~... A haunted house isn't the kind of attraction you go in to fight the ghosts!\r\nHiyori: It's not?\r\nKanami: You're supposed to get scared when you see the ghosts, but you shouted \"There you are, ghost!\" and tried to beat them. You're the one who scared me.\r\nHiyori: But, if they're going to threaten us, it's our right to fight back.\r\nKanami: You're the one who doesn't know how to have fun, Hiyori-chan...\r\nKanami: Ah, phone call.\r\nKanami: Yes, this is Etou Kanami. ...Okay, understood.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan, there was an aradama outbreak near here!\r\nHiyori: I see. That haunted house was a good warmup. Let's go!\r\n\r\nHiyori: Hm? Isn't that Kiyoka and Mirja over there?\r\nMirja: Etou Kanami, Juujou Hiyori. Were you also on your way to defeat the aradama that appeared?\r\nKanami: Yeah, they just called me about it. We happened to be nearby, so we could come deal with it right away. Were you two also in the area?\r\nKiyoka: We came to look into the Akabane swords around here.\r\nMirja: It would be reassuring, having the two of you with us. Let's head toward the scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: We Can't Be Seen?\r\n\r\nMirja: All clear, extermination complete.\r\nKiyoka: Pant, pant... We managed to beat them...\r\nKanami: I'm glad we ran into you, Musumi-san, Kitora-san. Hiyori-chan, it's not closing time yet, is it?\r\nHiyori: It should still be open.\r\nKiyoka: Open? What are you talking about?\r\nKanami: There's an amusement park near here that we were playing in.\r\nHiyori: We have tickets that are valid for today only, but the others were all too busy to come.\r\nKiyoka: That doesn't surprise me. An amusement park, huh... That sounds like fun...\r\nKanami: If you want, you and Kitora-san should come with us!\r\nKiyoka: Can we?\r\nHiyori: We have enough tickets for four people. And it'd make Mai happy to know they didn't go to waste.\r\nKiyoka: Then I want to go!\r\nKiyoka: Mirja-san, we took care of the aradama, so...\r\nMirja: I see nothing wrong with it. Our mission is completed, and this is a good stopping point, so we may as well.\r\nKiyoka: Yes!\r\nKanami: They're closing soon, so we should race back there!\r\nKiyoka: Okay!\r\n\r\nAt that time, the two from the elite guard were--\r\n\r\nSuzuka: We made it back safely before the park closed.\r\nMaki: It's a good thing we dealt with them so quickly.\r\nMaki: You seemed stronger than usual today, Suzuka. Did you want to ride the merry go round that badly?\r\nSuzuka: I always put all my efforts into suppressing aradama.\r\nMaki: Right, that was rude of me. Anyway, we're back now, so let's pick up where we left off.\r\nMaki: And this is the place. Ready to show me those horseriding skills you're so proud of?\r\nSuzuka: Of course; let's get on that white horse over there. Hah-!\r\n\r\nKanami: Huh?\r\nKanami: Over there, isn't that... Shidou-san and Konohana-san!?\r\nHiyori: Wha, am I hallucinating?\r\nMirja: The Shidou Maki and Konohana Suzuka are...\r\nKiyoka: Laughing and riding the merry go round together...\r\nKiyoka: Ah-, they're getting off. Hide!\r\nHiyori: I went along with it and hid, but...\r\nMirja: Why should we need to hide?\r\nKiyoka: Sorry, I just felt like we saw something we weren't supposed to be seeing...\r\nKanami: Well why don't we just watch them like this for a while?\r\nSuzuka: I had a good time on the merry go round. On top of that, I now have this photo of Maki-san riding a white horse to make as my phone's background.\r\nMaki: Wh-When did you take that picture!? If anybody else saw me like that...\r\nSuzuka: And with this, I have Maki-san's weakness in the palm of my hand.\r\nMaki: You wouldn't!\r\nSuzuka: Ufufu, I'm only joking~.\r\nKiyoka: They're like completely different people from when they're fighting...\r\nKanami: Yeah, they look like they're having a good time. Why don't we try calling out to them and joining up?\r\nMirja: Etou Kanami, that wouldn't be very tactful of you. The two of them must rarely get to spend time like this together, so we shouldn't disturb them.\r\nHiyori: Ahh, I agree... I have no idea how I'm supposed to react to them...\r\nKanami: Mmmm, that's a good point. Then, why don't we go ride something else?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: It's Always a Serious Competition\r\n\r\nKiyoka: So many attractions look like fun that I can't make up my mind. What can the four of us do together...\r\nKanami: Ah! Let's race the go karts over there! It'd be cool to have a showdown with each other.\r\nHiyori: A showdown? That could be good.\r\nMirja: I agree, I'll join in.\r\nKiyoka: If everyone wants to do it... Me too.\r\nHiyori: Hmm... I thought it would be more intended for children, but that looks like a proper course.\r\nMirja: The kart's frames look to be the latest model. This should be a good environment for a conclusive showdown.\r\nKiyoka: Are we going to be driving these...? I wonder how safe it is...\r\nKanami: Musumi-san, you can drive as safely as you feel like.\r\nHiyori: That's right, you shouldn't feel pressured to drive any faster than you're comfortable with. Just go at your own pace.\r\nHiyori: However-- I'm going on an all out offensive. I'll start from the innermost track. Does anyone mind?\r\nKiyoka: Eh? Does it matter where you start from? They all go the same way.\r\nHiyori: That's naive, Kiyoka. Starting closer to the inside gives you a shorter route to the goal. You need to take the course considering the fundamentals of racing.\r\nKanami: Ooh, Hiyori-chan's eyes are lighting up like when she's going into battle...!\r\nKanami: Wait, then I want to start from the inside too! I won't lose to Hiyori-chan!\r\nKanami: We should do a game of rock-paper-scissors to decide who starts there.\r\nHiyori: Hm... Fine then. Our showdown begins with rock-paper-scissors. There's no way I'm losing.\r\nKanami: Me neither!\r\nKiyoka: (Wow... Those two, they're so serious about this...)\r\nHiyori: Hm? By the way, what happened to Mirja? I haven't seen her since we got here...\r\nMirja: Excuse me, I kept you waiting.\r\nKiyoka: Where'd you go, Mirja-san?\r\nMirja: To the park office, so I could borrow some tools.\r\nKanami: Tools? For what?\r\nMirja: For modifying the engine.\r\nKiyoka: Ehh!?\r\nMirja: In the world of competition, it's only natural to take every available avenue towards seizing victory.\r\nHiyori: I get it... Not just thinking of where you start, but the machine you start in. Not bad, Mirja.\r\nKiyoka: Should you really be impressed by that!?\r\nKiyoka: This is looking like an even more dangerous competition than I thought...\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Maki and Suzuka were walking nearby--\r\n\r\nSuzuka: That's an incredible noise they're making.\r\nMaki: That must be the engines of the go karts over there.\r\nMaki: Th-They're fast! I didn't think karts these days could reach those speeds.\r\nMaki: I want to try driving one, but the park's about to close.\r\nSuzuka: In that case, why not come back here again? We were on a mission today, so we're still in uniform, but we can dress up and come back next time we have a day off!\r\nMaki: Ahh, I'd like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Amusement Park Memories\r\n\r\nYui: Oh yeah, Kiyoka-chan, when the investigation team has time off, where do you go for fun?\r\nKiyoka: Hmm... Everyone gets different days off, so it's hard getting us all together.\r\nKiyoka: Ah, but not too long ago, I went with Mirja-san to an amusement park after a mission.\r\nYui: Mirja-san went to an amusement park!? I'd never have guessed you're into those!\r\nMirja: I'm willing to go to amusement parks. And, at the time, Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori offered us tickets.\r\nYui: Oh, really? That sounds like a good time, everyone at the amusement park.\r\nKiyoka: Yes! It was! You should come with us next time, Yui-chan!\r\nYui: Ah... Sorry! I'm super happy you invited me, but I won't go to amusement parks...\r\nKiyoka: Eh? Why not?\r\nMirja: Are you not good with the rides?\r\nYui: It's not like that...\r\nYui: To tell the truth, for years now, my little sister's been sick in the hospital.\r\nYui: When she was first starting elementary school, we went to an amusement park together.\r\nYui: But she was still really short at the time, so she couldn't ride the roller coaster.\r\nYui: So on the way home, I promised her that, when she's tall enough to ride, we'd go together again.\r\nYui: ...But my little sister isn't ready for that promise yet.\r\nYui: Even now, she still brings it up. When she's better, she wants to go with me.\r\nYui: So I made up my mind too; that until she's feeling better I won't go to an amusement park with anyone.\r\nMirja: Is that a form of offering?\r\nKiyoka: Offering...? What do you mean?\r\nMirja: When making a prayer, you vow to give up something you enjoy. The idea is that through abstinence, your prayer becomes stronger.\r\nYui: I see~! That's sort of like it! I must be feeling superstitious.\r\nYui: ...Hey, cut it out, you two. You don't have to go feeling all sorry for my sake~.\r\nYui: After all, there's not a doubt in my mind my sister's going to get better!\r\nYui: So once she gets out of the hospital, let's all go to an amusement park together!\r\nKiyoka: --Sure!\r\nMirja: Okay. I'll look forward to it."}, {"paste_key": "wAvJ2G3M", "title": "2-10 The Three Goddesses", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/wAvJ2G3M", "timestamp": "", "hits": "119", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0bKHugwrXA\r\n\r\n1: Identity\r\n\r\nSuzuka: --That's not her. As far as I can tell from the footage, the strange hooded person who attacked those toji wasn't Maki-san.\r\nSuzuka: However, there do seem to be two different hooded toji. I don't doubt that one of them is Maki-san.\r\nSuzuka: More than likely, what Mashiko-san and Itomi-san saw was the result of the unknown one's attack, and Maki-san immediately chasing after her.\r\nSuzuka: She's always like this... If you'd only stayed and explained yourself, you wouldn't be a suspect right now.\r\nAkane: ...So you came to the same conclusion after all.\r\nSuzuka: On that note, do you have any ideas as to the identity of the other hooded toji?\r\nAkane: ...She may have an okatana, but that doesn't mean she has to be a toji.\r\nSuzuka: ? What do you mean?\r\nAkane: The strange hooded girl who has been attacking toji is none other than Tagitsuhime.\r\nSuzuka: What--!? Tagitsuhime was driven back to the netherworld though...!?\r\n\r\nAfter encountering the classified hooded toji, Mihono and the other members of the former investigation team completed their reassignment to Renpu Girls' School.\r\nAt which point, they were made aware of that toji's identity--\r\n\r\nMihono: You mean, that toji was Tagitsuhime!?\r\nMirja: If the hooded toji we faced was actually Tagitsuhime, how would that be possible?\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan and I don't know much more than what Akane-sama explained to us, but...\r\nHiyori: ...After our attack on her, the great aradama within Origami Yukari seems to have split into three. Tagitsuhime, Takirihime, and Ichikishimahime.\r\nHiyori: Right now, the three of them don't appear like normal aradama, but are instead going around looking like people. Each with their own free will.\r\nHiyori: And Tagitsuhime has been collecting noro from wherever she can.\r\nKiyoka: The great aradama split into three, and they're all acting on their own...!? Can it really do that...!!\r\nChie: What about the other two, Takirihime and Ichikishimahime. Do you know where they are or what they're up to?\r\nHiyori: Takirihime and Ichikishimahime are both separately kept under government protection. I should mention, Kanami and I met Takirihime the other day.\r\nMihono: You and Kanami did!?\r\nKofuki: Mannn, I wanna meet her too. I'd love to smash up another human shaped aradama, like Suruga.\r\nYui: If they're toji, then that means they're girls, right? If the great aradama's a girl...\r\nHana: Is that really all you picked up on, Yui? Here, take this 100 yen and go buy some ice cream. I'll call you back when the serious conversation is over.\r\nYui: Ah, I won't mess around anymore! I want to be with my friends-!\r\nHiyori: ...Can I continue now?\r\nChie: Sorry. Please go on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Tagitsuhime's Objective\r\n\r\nHiyori: After we fought it, the great aradama split into Tagitsuhime, Takirihime, and Ichikishimahime. You're all clear on that much, right?\r\nMihono: Yeah. So it sounds like Tagitsuhime was the one who stole our noro just a little while ago.\r\nKofuki: Who'd have thought that was the great aradama. If I'd have known, I would've have chased her down and kicked her ass.\r\nMirja: Is it safe to assume Tagitsuhime is gathering noro to recover her lost power?\r\nKanami: That's probably what's happening. After all, Takirihime said \"Tagitsuhime is gaining strength.\"\r\nKanami: And also, when Hiyori-chan and I met her, she demanded we bring her Ichikishimahime.\r\nChie: Ichikishimahime...? What does Takirihime plan on doing if she gets her? Isn't it possible that Takirihime could be trying to recover her lost strength too...?\r\nYui: Like, if Takirihime is trying to combine with Ichikishimahime? And then if they combine with Tagitsuhime, they can get all the power that was split up back together... Or something like that?\r\nKiyoka: I don't believe it... Just when we thought it was sealed in the netherworld...\r\nHana: The situation is starting to sound awfully complicated. What are we supposed to be doing about this, anyway?\r\nHiyori: Don't panic. There's still more to explain.\r\nKanami: Actually, not too long ago, Hiyori-chan and I fought Tagitsuhime. I mean, the Tagitsuhime who came after they split into three.\r\nMihono: Ehh-!? When did that happen!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Maki's Request\r\n\r\nKanami: We just happened to be at the Ministry of Defense, when Tagitsuhime attacked the place.\r\nKiyoka: You just happened to be at the Ministry of Defense... That's a pretty amazing story...\r\nHiyori: Takirihime is being safeguarded at the Ministry of Defense. That's what Tagitsuhime was after.\r\nChie: You mean, even though they were all one before, they're fighting with each other?\r\nMirja: So in attempting to absorb Takirihime, Takirihime wants to take back her power while retaining her own will? Is that how it is?\r\nKanami: Right. When she split into three, it seems like each of them became their own individual.\r\nKanami: I can't really explain it, but, when I talked to Takirihime, she seemed different from the Tagitsuhime we all fought before. I think, maybe she isn't our enemy right now.\r\nYui: An aradama that isn't our enemy... So like Nene, who's always with Kaoru-san?\r\nKanami: And also, when the two of us fought Tagitsuhime, she was so strong that neither of us could do anything to her.\r\nMihono: Even with you and Juujou-san together!?\r\nKofuki: That's the best... I wanna try fighting her too...!!\r\nKanami: But then Shidou-san came to back us up. With her help, we were able to get a bit of an advantage, but then Tagitsuhime suddenly disappeared in the middle of the fight.\r\nHiyori: ...After the battle, Shidou Maki spoke to us. Saying she had two objectives right now.\r\nHiyori: One was suppressing Tagitsuhime. And the other was recovering something vital to making that happen.\r\nHana: Vital to suppressing Tagitsuhime? Recover what?\r\nKanami: Right. What Shidou-san said was...\r\nKanami: \"I want to save Tsubakuro Yume from the netherworld.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: A Single Possibility\r\n\r\nKiyoka: There's a way to bring back Tsubakuro-san after she died? Are you serious...?\r\nMirja: I don't believe it. How would you even begin to...\r\nSuzuka: We'll take over the explanation from here.\r\nHana: -!? Konohana Suzuka-san, Shidou Maki-san...!!\r\nMaki: To combat powerful aradama, we in the elite guard injected noro into our bodies.\r\nMaki: To make that power our own, we accepted, used the noro.\r\nMaki: ...And still, Yume lost her life.\r\nSuzuka: Yume's passing wasn't something we could take so easily... We couldn't help but search for anything we could do...\r\nSuzuka: At the end of it all, there was one possibility we found.\r\nSuzuka: With your help, Yume may still be able to be sa--\r\nChie: Why should we help you!?\r\nMihono: Ch-Chii-nee!? What's gotten into you!?\r\nChie: That girl, Tsubakuro-san, was responsible for the destruction of Mokusa. Saving someone like that... I want nothing to do with it.\r\nMaki: ...We didn't know the truth back then.\r\nChie: That doesn't mean I'm going to forgive you!\r\nYui: H-Hey, calm down, Chie-san. Why don't we at least hear Suzuka-san out all the way to the end?\r\nChie: ......I know. I know, that this is just my own selfish feelings. Please, keep going.\r\nAkane: Then, why don't I be the one to explain to you all?\r\nKanami: --Eh-!? Akane-sama!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu\r\n\r\nAkane: There's a possibility that Tsubakuro-san, who accepted strength from aradama, could still be living on in the netherworld.\r\nAkane: And, using the utsushi of Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu that Setouchi-san possesses, there's a chance we could call Tsubakuro-san from the netherworld back to our own.\r\nChie: The utsushi of Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu...!?\r\nAkane: Sixty years ago, the real Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu was used to defeat the great aradama-- To make things easier, we'll call it \"Kai\".\r\nAkane: Tethered to this Kai, in the depths of the netherworld, should be the real Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu.\r\nAkane: What you have... No, what remains in the present world, is the utsushi of Kagemitsu. So long as it remains here, that must mean the original continues to exist in the netherworld.\r\nAkane: As for the method of saving Tsubakuro Yume-san. To put it simply, Ichikishimahime will act as a medium-- Guiding you into the netherworld.\r\nAkane: And, using that utsushi of Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, you will need to defeat Kai.\r\nAkane: In doing so, the real Kagemitsu, bound to Kai in the netherworld, should be returned to you.\r\nAkane: Then, with the real Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, if you could find and break the chains binding Tsubakuro-san to the netherworld, it's possible we could call her back here\r\nAkane: The Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu which sent Kai to the netherworld sixty years ago had that much power within it.\r\nAkane: However, with no precedent for this, this possibility is ultimately no more than conjecture upon conjecture.\r\nMirja: I-If something like that works... To begin with, this Kagemitsu wasn't a replica, but an actual utsushi...?\r\nYui: ...Mihono-chan. Are you getting any of this?\r\nMihono: B-Bits and pieces...\r\nKiyoka: I don't exactly understand it all either, but, can people from the real world actually travel into the netherworld...?\r\nKofuki: Yeah, is it really safe for us to go into the netherworld like that? There's gotta be a chance we can't make it out either, right?\r\nAkane: For those concerns, we're depending on Ichikishimahime's assistance. With her help, this plan becomes possible.\r\nHana: ...Chie-san, what will you do? From listening to their proposal, at the very least, Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi is an absolute requirement.\r\nChie: ......\r\nMaki: I won't ask you to forget all the things we've done.\r\nMaki: But please, won't you consider helping us to recover Yume? This is all to help in defeating Tagitsuhime.\r\nSuzuka: Yume capabilities surpass even Maki-san. In the fight against Tagitsuhime, Yume's strength will be critical.\r\nMaki: I'm begging you! So long as there's a chance, we have to take it!\r\nSuzuka: Please, consider it!\r\nChie: (...What am I supposed to do? Was this why President Souraku left Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi under my supervision, so I'd be forced to make a choice like this...?)\r\nMirja: (...Something's not right about this proposal. This operation revolves around the usage of Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu's utsushi...)\r\nMirja: (And yet, why is Origami Akane the one proposing it, and not President Souraku, who formed the investigation team and entrusted Setouchi Chie with the utsushi of Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu...?)\r\nMirja: (What's happening to Ayanokouji Martial Arts School, to President Souraku...?)"}, {"paste_key": "R3D1VRXQ", "title": "Steady as She Goes!

This is where the JMSDF ships are.\r\nChie: Sorry, you three. Did we keep you waiting?\r\nKanami: Ah, Setouchi-san! And Shichinosato-san too!\r\nKofuki: I heard we were getting backup, but I didn't think it was you, Sayaka. And Kanami and Kaoru too. Just so we're clear, don't get between me and my prey.\r\nKaoru: Yeah, actually, take as much as you want. Here's hoping I won't have to lift a finger.\r\nChie: Thank you for helping us on this mission. I know the Special Task Team has been shorthanded lately.\r\nKanami: You don't have to thank us! Defeating aradama is a toji's job, after all!\r\nSayaka: It looks like there's another person here...\r\nMatsunaga Yurina: ...First year in high school at the Heijou Institute, Matsunaga Yurina. ...I'll be joining you on this mission.\r\nKanami: So they got 6 of us ready this time.\r\nChie: No, there's more. The lacquerer from the mountings department, Terashimo-san, and Hashi-san, who's taking preparatory courses in engineering, are coming too. They should already be on the ship.\r\nChie: If it's okay with everyone, we should get on board. The trip shouldn't be long.\r\nKanami: Okay!\r\nYurina: ......\r\n\r\nTerashimo Hoozuki: Ah, over here. We were waiting for you.\r\nHashi Keiko: Um, nice to meet you...\r\nChie: Yes, it's nice to meet you two.\r\nChie: Terashimo-san. I hate to ask this right off the bat, but could you explain the details of today's mission? We haven't heard anything yet.\r\nHoozuki: Sure, straight away. Our mission is to go around to lots of islands and get rid of the aradama there.\r\nHoozuki: But it sounds like we also have to find the points where all these aradama came from.\r\nKaoru: This mission sounds like it could drag on for a while...\r\nKofuki: Kuku... All those aradama-chan crowding about. Sounds like a good time waiting to happen.\r\nKanami: You're feeling motivated, aren't you, Shichinosato-san!\r\nKofuki: You know it!\r\nSayaka: Kofuki likes fighting aradama.\r\nYurina: .........\r\nKanami: Hm? What's wrong, Matsunaga-san? Is there something stuck to my face?\r\nYurina: ...No, it's nothing.\r\nKanami: (Matsunaga-san... If I remember, she has extremely quick and beautiful swordsmanship. I can't wait to see her fighting up close.)\r\nChie: Now then, that's the details of our mission. We should be leaving port soon.\r\nChie: I've been appointed as leader here, so let's all get along.\r\nKanami: Okay! I'll follow you, leader!\r\n\r\nKaoru: ...It's been a while now since we set sail... Ugh... I'm not good with staying cramped like this for so long. My Nenekirimaru needs room to breathe.\r\nKanami: That's just because your okatana is so big. The blade of my Chidori is short, so I'm totally fine in here.\r\nKaoru: Small swords must be handy at times like this.\r\nSayaka: You have a small body, Kaoru, so you shouldn't have a problem.\r\nKaoru: What was that?\r\nChie: Everyone, we're about to arrive at the first island, so get ready to disembark. According to the investigation by STT members who got here before us, the aradama should have originated from the mountains on the island.\r\nKofuki: There's mountains out here in the middle of the ocean? Well, I don't really care so long as there's aradama to hunt there!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Trouble's Brewing!\r\n\r\nChie: ...Mm, that should do it. Thank you, Itomi-san. I wouldn't have been able to put together this progress report before we left for the next island if it wasn't for your help.\r\nSayaka: All I did was talk to all the people on the island. Chie, does this mean today's mission is going well?\r\nChie: I think we're making good progress. Nothing worth mentioning has gone wrong so far...\r\nHoozuki: S-S-Setouchi-san, we need help! Etou-san fell in the ocean!\r\nChie: Eh-!?\r\nHoozuki: Mashiko-san's okatana wasn't long enough to reach down to the water from the deck either...\r\nSayaka: Even for Kaoru's Nenekirimaru, that's too far...\r\nChie: There should be a lifesaver on the deck! Use that!\r\nChie: Hoozuki-san, go tell the JMSDF personnel not to start the ship!\r\nHoozuki: Yes ma'am, I'll go as fast as I can!\r\nKofuki: Man, what the hell were they doing?\r\n\r\nJMSDF Official: Is it alright if we get the ship moving now?\r\nChie: Yes. I'm very sorry we cost your time like this.\r\nJMSDF Official: Don't worry, all that matters is that Etou-san safely got back on board.\r\nKanami: Achoo! Uuu, the air conditioning is making it feel even colder...\r\nChie: I'm just glad that's the worst that came of it. If you'd fallen off after we'd departed, you could have gotten caught up in the propellers.\r\nYurina: ...Sorry. It was my fault...\r\nSayaka: What do you mean...?\r\nYurina: ...At the tournament, I saw Etou-san's swordfighting. She fought so well... So I wanted a to challenge her to a bout myself...\r\nKaoru: And while they were fighting, Kanami lost her balance and splashed right in the water.\r\nKanami: It's my fault too, for accepting your challenge. And I'm the one who fell in...\r\nChie: So that's what happened... At any rate, you're not allowed to fight each other up on the deck anymore. You caused trouble for the JSMDF officials, and we're meant to be on a mission right now.\r\nKanami: Got it! I'm sorry.\r\nYurina: ...Understood.\r\nSayaka: ...Kanami, why did you fall in the water?\r\nKanami: Huh?\r\nSayaka: Normally you would never lose your balance in the middle of a fight.\r\nKanami: Oh... Well, actually... Ever since this mission started, I've been feeling a little off.\r\nKanami: You know how the ship's always swaying, right? I think it's throwing off my senses...\r\nSayaka: When you were fighting, the ship was still in port... You could still feel it swaying?\r\nKanami: Yeah. Even in port, I could still feel it a little, the effect of the waves on the ship.\r\nKaoru: I can't feel it at all...\r\nYurina: ...I don't feel it either.\r\nChie: Etou-san must have sharper senses than most people... That's why she's affected by it.\r\nKaoru: Kanami's got the senses of a wild beast, after all.\r\nKanami: A wild beast... You could have phrased that a little nicer.\r\nKanami: Mmm... But, I hate that I couldn't fight at full strength while we were up on the deck. I might have to fight aradama at some point in a place that's swaying like that.\r\nKaoru: You're taking it too seriously. Like you're ever going to end up fighting in such specific circumstances.\r\nHoozuki: Ah, Kanami-san, your okatana is still dripping wet. Do you mind if I look after it? If we don't give it some maintenance soon, the guard and handle could be damaged.\r\nKanami: Whoa, you're right. Then, can I leave it to you?\r\nHoozuki: Sure, it won't take long.\r\n\r\nHoozuki: There, Chidori's all taken care of.\r\nKanami: That's amazing! It's even easier to get a grip on than before! Thanks!\r\nHoozuki: It's nothing, I was glad to help. I'm here on this mission in case something like this happened, after all.\r\nKanami: I feel a lot better having a specialist like you around!\r\nKanami: ...Ah, that's it. Just like how I had you look at my okatana, I need an expert on fighting in unstable conditions... I just need a specialist with a lot of experience to give me some tips!\r\nSayaka: A specialist...?\r\nChie: Everyone, we're about to arrive at the next island, so please get ready. According to reports, aradama have been appearing in caves in the mountains there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Sayaka's Request\r\n\r\nKaoru: There's just no end to this mission, is there. Though, when we're sailing around like this there's not much to do, so we get a bit of a break. And the curry they make is super good.\r\nKanami: Yeah, the curry's good, isn't it...\r\nSayaka: Kanami, you sound sad. Is something wrong?\r\nKanami: That's because... I went to talk to Shichinosato-san earlier, to see if she'd teach me how to fight better without losing your footing. But she told me she's not the right person to be teaching anybody...\r\nKanami: Shichinosato-san has a lot of experience in actual combat, and she's so light on her feet even though she's dual wielding, so she must have a great sense of balance. So I thought I'd ask her to teach me the hang of it...\r\nKaoru: Ahh, so Kofuki's the specialist you went for?\r\nSayaka: You want to learn from Kofuki, Kanami?\r\nKanami: Yeah... But, it's no use. Aww, I thought it was a good idea too...\r\nSayaka: ...Okay, I understand. I'll ask her.\r\nKanami: Eh? You will?\r\nSayaka: Kofuki and I go to Renpu Girls' Academy together, so we aren't strangers.\r\n\r\nSayaka: Kofuki, are you busy?\r\nKofuki: Huh? Oh, it's you, Sayaka. ...And what, you're back again, Kanami?\r\nKanami: Sorry to bother you. But I really want to learn from you, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: Didn't I tell you last time? I'm no good at that teaching stuff.\r\nSayaka: Kofuki, will you say no even if I say please?\r\nKofuki: What?\r\nSayaka: I want you to teach Kanami... Please.\r\nKofuki: Ugh, don't lower your head like that. If President Takatsu finds out you're doing this, she's gonna make a big stink about it later.\r\nSayaka: Kanami's in trouble right now. So... Kofuki, please.\r\nKofuki: ...Seriously...\r\nKofuki: Tch... Okay, I get it already. You're really not giving me a choice here.\r\nKanami: Eh, so you'll teach me...!?\r\nKofuki: Don't get the wrong idea. I can't teach anybody.\r\nKofuki: So when we're on the next island, just stay close to me while I'm fighting. If you can pick up anything from the way I fight, go right ahead.\r\nKanami: Shichinosato-san... Thanks! That's enough for me!\r\nChie: Ah, there you are. Etou-san, Itomi-san, Kofuki-chan. We're about to arrive at the next island. It seems like we could be fighting right away, so please get ready.\r\nKofuki: Alright, let's go, Kanami.\r\nKanami: Okay! I can't wait; I didn't think I'd get a chance to see your swordfighting up close so soon.\r\n\r\nKofuki: Kuku... All these beautiful aradama-chan crawling about, it's too much. Try to keep up, Kanami!\r\nKanami: Yeah, I'll watch you as close as I can!\r\nKanami: I get it... Moving with your center of balance in mind like that, if your stance is ever unstable, you can correct it right away. There's no chance of falling...\r\nKanami: Wait? But, how should I swing my okatana? Like this? Or, like this?\r\nKofuki: ...No, you've gotta get your footwork right first.\r\nKanami: Eh? My footwork? Hmm, then I'll pay close attention next time.\r\nKofuki: Next time... Are we gonna keep doing this?\r\nKanami: Of course! As long as you'll let me, Shichinosato-san!\r\nSayaka: Kofuki, please.\r\nKofuki: ...Sigh, fine. Do whatever you want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Young Sailors\r\n\r\nChie: Good work, everyone. I've confirmed that all aradama have been exterminated. Our work in the Izu islands is done.\r\nKaoru: Geez, finally. Ahh, that took forever.\r\nKofuki: What, that's all of them? I could keep going if there's more aradama-chan around.\r\nHoozuki: Wow, you two are total opposites.\r\nKanami: Shichinosato-san, thanks for your help today. I learned a couple techniques thanks to you.\r\nSayaka: Kofuki. Thank you.\r\nKofuki: You're throwing me off, so cut it out.\r\nYurina: ......\r\nKaoru: What're you up to, Yurina? You keep staring at Kanami. You weren't looking for another match against her, were you?\r\nYurina: ...!\r\nKaoru: Oi oi, so I got it right...?\r\nKanami: Excuse me, Setouchi-san? Would it be alright if I fought Matsunaga-san one more time up on the deck?\r\nKanami: Our match was unfinished since I fell off last time, and it's been bugging me ever since.\r\nYurina: ...Me too.\r\nKaoru: I already had Kanami figured out, but I guess Matsunaga's the same level of swordfighting idiot.\r\nChie: Mmm, well...\r\nSayaka: I want to see them fight too.\r\nKofuki: I don't really care either way. But if Sayaka wants to see it, I guess I'm siding with her?\r\nChie: Fufu... Honestly, there's no getting around it, is there. If that's what you want, then let's all go out on the deck.\r\nKanami: Yes! Thanks, Setouchi-san!\r\n\r\nKanami: Terashimo-san! Thanks a lot for doing maintenance on our okatana before the fight!\r\nHoozuki: You're welcome! Do your best, Kanami-san, Matsunaga-san!\r\nChie: Now, are you two ready? ...Then, let the match begin!\r\nYurina: Fu...\r\nKaoru: Oh, Matsunaga instantly closed the distance?\r\nSayaka: Don't worry. Kanami is ready now.\r\nYurina: ...I'll cut you down.\r\nKanami: Kh...! Her sword's as fast as I remember...!\r\nYurina: ...You dodged...!\r\nKofuki: Haha... Kanami, she seriously stole my moves. That girl's crazy.\r\nKanami: Now it's my turn!\r\nYurina: ...Gh, ugh.\r\nChie: That's enough! The winner of this match is Etou-san!\r\n\r\nKanami: Thanks for the fight, Matsunaga-san! It was so exciting!\r\nYurina: ...It's frustrating. Still, I'm glad we fought too...\r\nKaoru: Now that that's over, we can get back out to sea. It'll be a while before we get back to the Port of Yokosuka and they can send us on another mission, so might as well kick back and relax.\r\nChie: Kaoru-san, about that... We aren't going back that way, you know.\r\nKaoru: What?\r\nChie: The JSMDF appreciated our work here today, and asked us to accompany them all the way out to the Bonin Islands, where reports of aradama have come in.\r\nKaoru: The Bonin Islands... Isn't that way off in the other direction? No way, there's no way I'm going!\r\nSayaka: Kaoru, your phone's ringing.\r\nKaoru: ...I don't want to answer it... Ugh...\r\nManiwa Sana: It's me.\r\nKaoru: Of course it's the president... What's this about?\r\nSana: Just now, I was approached directly by the Special Task Team HQ. I don't want to hear a word of complaint, just do it. Bye.\r\nKaoru: Hey...!\r\nKeiko: Um, everyone...\r\nHoozuki: Oh, what's up? You haven't come out of the engine room since we started, Hashi-san.\r\nKeiko: The guys in the JSMDF told me to give these to you...\r\nKanami: Wow! These are female sailor uniforms, aren't they?\r\nKaoru: Damnit, she had this all planned! She pulled all the strings to get me out here...!\r\nSayaka: Kofuki, what will you do? If we ask, I think they'll let us go home.\r\nKofuki: Who do you think I am? No matter how far, if there's a fight against aradama-chan, I'll be there.\r\nSayaka: Okay... Then, I'll go too.\r\nKanami: Great! Then I'll use this chance to study even more on how Shichinosato-san fights!\r\nKofuki: Kanami... Are you still gonna be following me around?\r\nKanami: Yeah! Can't I?\r\nKofuki: ...Sigh~, suit yourself. I'm the one who said you could watch and copy me, after all.\r\nKanami: Awesome! Thanks, Shichinosato-san!\r\nKofuki: Man, I'm starting to get why the people around you call you a sword otaku."}, {"paste_key": "xPDdBhJb", "title": "Toji and the Dungeon", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/xPDdBhJb", "timestamp": "", "hits": "89", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK-DkM29FI8\r\n\r\n1: Awakening in a Dungeon\r\n\r\n--How am I meant to become stronger than I already am? Whenever I'm training, that's always on my mind.\r\nStill, what should I be doing besides swinging my okatana? What should I be doing besides polishing what I already know? Is there something else, something I'm missing?\r\nAgain and again, I can't get it out of my mind. But I still haven't found the answer...\r\n\r\nKaoru: Jeez. They said there's a huge outbreak of aradama in these hills, but the spectrum finder hasn't picked up anything since we got here. Yoo, Hiyori, how's your thing doing?\r\nHiyori: Nn? Ahh... My spectrum meter hasn't reacted either.\r\nEllen: Hmm, this is strange. The report said they were right around here.\r\nMihono: You think maybe, they ran away...?\r\nKiyoka: But, the STT officers have the area surrounded. If they saw something, surely they'd call us about it...\r\nKaoru: Hey, why don't we just head back to the command post and check? We're only wasting our time walking in circles out here.\r\nHiyori: ...You're right. That's probably for the best.\r\nMihono: Okay. You lead the way, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: Alright. Umm, if I remember right, the command post was this way... ...Huh? What's that sound?\r\nMihono: Uhh, beats me? Actually, can you feel the ground shaking?\r\nHiyori: You two, watch where you're standing! The ground's collapsing!\r\nKiyoka: Eh...? Wah, kyaaaaaaa-!\r\nMihono: Kiyoka...! Ah, I'm falling tooooooo!\r\nKaoru: Whoahh, it's even happening over here!\r\nEllen: Ahh, I can't escape!\r\nHiyori: Kh... If I use jin'i...!\r\nHiyori: N-No use... My balance...!\r\n\r\nHiyori: ..................ugh...\r\nKaoru: Oh, Hiyori's awake.\r\nMihono: Juujou-san, are you okay!? Did you get hurt anywhere!?\r\nHiyori: Ahh, I'm fine... But, where are we...?\r\nEllen: We're in some kind of cave system.\r\nKiyoka: But, it's weird... The ground under our feet collapsed, yet...\r\nHiyori: There's no hole in the ceiling...!?\r\nKaoru: That's not all that's weird. Take a look around the cave. Isn't it strangely bright in here?\r\nHiyori: Now that you mention it... Those crystals have some kind of glow to them. What do you think they are...?\r\nKaoru: We can't get through to call for rescue, and it's anyone's guess which way we should go to get out... Aghh, why does this have to happen to me.\r\nMihono: Huh? Any of you guys hear that?\r\nKiyoka: That sound... It sounds like someone's fighting!\r\nKaoru: Nnn? Aren't we supposed to be the only toji out here?\r\nEllen: Then maybe that's our rescue.\r\nHiyori: Whoever they are, we can't ignore them. Let's go, everyone.\r\n\r\nHiyori: They're close! Right up ahead!\r\nMihono: I think I see them...! Wait, huhhh!?\r\n???: Hmph...!\r\n???: Unleashed streak of light, bow limbs of the holy tree. You are an expert of the bow. Shoot, sniper of the fairies. Penetrate, arrow of absolute accuracy...\r\n???: Arcs Ray!\r\nAradama: GUAAAAAA...\r\nKaoru: W-W-W-Wh-What the hell!?\r\nEllen: There's a beautiful girl in armor, and an elf, and magic!!\r\nHiyori: Magic...!? That's not real though...!?\r\nAradama: GUAAAAAA!\r\n???: Ais-san, there's more of them!\r\nAis: Get back, Lefiya... I'll get rid of these monsters...\r\nMihono: Look out! They're getting surrounded!\r\nHiyori: If we use jin'i, we can get there in time! All of us should be able to force the aradama back!\r\n\r\n\r\n2: An Echoing Scream in Another World\r\n\r\nAis: Tempest!\r\nHiyori: (What... That girl, wind came and surrounded her body...!)\r\nAis: ...!\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOO...\r\nMihono: That's amazing! The rest of the aradama were beaten in no time!\r\nKaoru: Yeah... I can't believe what I'm seeing. She used the wind to cut them up.\r\nEllen: It's actual real magic power!\r\nKiyoka: Seems like they didn't need our help after all...\r\nAis: Phew...\r\nLefiya: That was fantastic, Ais-sama! Nicely done!\r\nAis: Nn, you too, Lefiya... And the rest of you too...\r\nLefiya: Thank you for your assistance. And, those weapons... Did you come from the far east, by any chance?\r\nMihono: Far... East...?\r\nAis: ...?\r\nLefiya: Eh? Am I wrong?\r\nKaoru: Ah, uhh, that's right. We're from the far east alright, you can't mistake it.\r\nHiyori: Oi, Kaoru...!?\r\nKaoru: Just play along for now. I've got no clue what's going on, but if we cause some misunderstanding these two could be big trouble for us, okay?\r\nHiyori: Well, you have a point...\r\nLefiya: We received a request from the guild, to investigate those monsters we were fighting just now... What brings all of you here?\r\nEllen: Right. We got a request from the guild too, to investigate the a... The monsters, you know.\r\nKaoru: Yeah, yeah. But, while we were investigating, we got lost. I hate to ask, but could you help show us the way back out?\r\nLefiya: Adventurers like yourselves got lost this close to the entrance...?\r\nEllen: I know, right! But all of us have a terrible sense of direction!\r\nMihono: Wow...! They just keep lying their way through everything...!\r\nKiyoka: Shhh. Don't say that so loud, Hono-chan.\r\nLefiya: A bad sense of direction...? Hmm... Ais-san, what should we do?\r\nAis: Nn, we should head up too... We've finished our investigation, after all...\r\nLefiya: That's true. Very well then, everyone. It's this way. We can exit together.\r\nHiyori: Ah... Thanks, and sorry to bother you.\r\nLefiya: It's no bother, Ais-sa--\r\nLefiya: --You're not Ais-sama!? I'm so sorry, I mistook you for her!\r\nHiyori: ...How?\r\n\r\nLefiya: We're going to make our report to the guild now, but what will you all do?\r\nKaoru: We were supposed to meet somewhere else first, so we'll stop by the guild later.\r\nEllen: That's right!\r\nLefiya: I see. Then, we'll be parting here. Let's go, Ais-san.\r\nAis: Nn...\r\n\r\nKaoru: ...Are they gone?\r\nEllen: All clear.\r\nKaoru: Then there's no point holding it in anymore...\r\nKaoru: What the hell's going on around hereeee!? Where the hell are we anywayyyyy!?\r\nEllen: I'm about to have a panic attack! Actually, I'm pretty sure I've been having one this whole time!\r\nMihono: Wawa, calm down, you two! Though it's not like I can calm down either!\r\nKiyoka: Elves, magic, guilds, monsters, adventurers... And the outside world looks like this... I think, maybe, we...\r\nHiyori: Did you figure something out, Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: Umm... Normally you wouldn't expect something like this to happen, but I read about it in novels a lot... We might have been sent to a parallel world...\r\nHiyori: Parallel world...?\r\nKaoru: Oi oi, seriously...?\r\nMihono: But, why? Weren't we just on a hillside?\r\nKiyoka: Well... When that hole opened under us, it might have been a link to another world, I think...\r\nEllen: Then, how are we supposed to get back to our world?\r\nKiyoka: Um... I don't know that much, exactly...\r\n???: Wawawa, what're you doing? Come on, let go of me!\r\nHiyori: Nn? What's going on?\r\nAradama: GUAAAAAA!\r\n???: Hyaaaa! I'm under attackkkk!\r\nMihono: Oh no! Those aradama are dragging that girl into the tower!\r\nKaoru: Wait, isn't that were we just came from!?\r\nHiyori: Let's get after them! We have to save her before we lose sight of them!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Goddess Hestia\r\n\r\n???: Oh boy, you girls saved me. I never expected to get attacked by monsters while I was working this part time job.\r\nHiyori: As long as you're safe. By the way, who are you...?\r\n???: I haven't introduced myself yet, have I? I'm Hestia. As you can see, I'm a goddess!\r\nMihono: A... Goddess...?\r\nEllen: Err, you're working a part time job even though you're a goddess?\r\nHestia: Uuu... There's a really good reason for that. But it'd take a while to explain, so you'll just have to trust me.\r\nKaoru: Oi, Kiyoka. Is she really a goddess? I mean, normally speaking, she does have a pretty ridiculous body type.\r\nKiyoka: I-I don't think her body matters... But this is a parallel world, so anything could be possible.\r\nHestia: Hmm? What're you whispering about? And, now that I look closer, I've never seen anyone like you before...\r\nHestia: ...Oh, I think I get it. Hmmhmm. I see, that's how it is.\r\nKaoru: Nn? That's how it is, what's how it is?\r\nKiyoka: D-Don't look at me...?\r\nHiyori: By the way, Hestia. Could you tell us about what's been going on in this town? We're, um, ahh, how should I put it...\r\nEllen: We just came back from a long journey, so we aren't up to date on how things have been going.\r\nHestia: Hmm, a long journey, huh? Okay. Well I'll go with that explanation for now.\r\nHestia: In that case, you girls must be surprised too, right? These past few days, this town's lost a lot of its liveliness.\r\nHiyori: Lost its liveliness...?\r\nHestia: Well you know, this town is made up of merchants and the adventurers who get compensated by them to defeat the monsters in the dungeon, right?\r\nHestia: But a few days ago, those weird monsters from before are the only thing people can find in the dungeon.\r\nHestia: Even when you beat them, they don't drop any items that can be turned in for money at the guild. So now the adventurers have had their supply of income cut off.\r\nHestia: Thanks to them, it's a mad dash for any part time jobs people can grab around town. Even my darling Bell-kun is out working against his will, far away from home...\r\nHestia: Awww... Bell-kun, come back and see me soon...\r\nMihono: Sounds like the aradama are putting the people here through a really hard time.\r\nHiyori: I guess that's why the two we met in the dungeon before were investigating them.\r\nKiyoka: Ah, then maybe...!\r\nEllen: Did you figure something out, Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: Yes. I think we might have been brought here to eliminate those aradama. So, once we clear them all out...\r\nMihono: I get it! Then we can go back to our world!\r\nMihono: Ah, but... Before we get sent back home, I kinda want to see for myself what they have around this world...\r\nKiyoka: Even if it's just once, I want to use magic.\r\nEllen: Oh! Good idea! Don't you think so, Hiyoyon?\r\nHiyori: I... Both the okatana and training my mother left me are all that I need...\r\nKaoru: Look at you, acting all serious. You know you can tell us you're way more into it than anyone, right? I saw the way your eyes were glued to them when they were casting magic back there.\r\nHiyori: Th-That was...\r\nKiyoka: Um, Hestia-sama? How would we go about using magic? None of us know how to...\r\nHestia: Hmm, magic, huh. There's a technique to it, but... Nn?\r\nHestia: Hello there? Who's feeling up my butt?\r\nKaoru: Butt? It isn't one of us.\r\nAradama: KISHAAAAAA-!\r\nHestia: Wawawa, there's another more! Hey, let go! Uhyaaa, I'm being kidnappedddddd! Outsiders, h-h-help meeeee!\r\nMihono: Ahh!? She got carried into the dungeon again!?\r\nKiyoka: Besides that, she called us \"outsiders\" just now...\r\nKaoru: They just keep going straight for that goddess, don't they?\r\nEllen: Aradama were enshrined as gods in the past, so maybe they think she's one of their friends?\r\nHiyori: Save it for later! We need to get Hestia back right now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Little Guide\r\n\r\nHestia: I can't thank you enough, really. Guess I shouldn't be going anywhere near the dungeon for a while.\r\nHiyori: That's probably a good idea...\r\nHestia: Still, you girls... Like I thought, you seem used to fighting those monsters.\r\nMihono: Eh? You can tell?\r\nKiyoka: And weren't you calling us \"outsiders\" before...?\r\nEllen: So did you figure out that we're from another world?\r\nHestia: Fufu, didn't I tell you? I'm a goddess. I knew all about that right from the start.\r\nKaoru: So then, the one who called us to this world is...\r\nHestia: Wait wait, that wasn't me. Gods using their powers on the lower world is off limits, as a rule.\r\nHestia: Though with the way things are around here, it's causing problems between the gods too, so one of them besides me might have tried getting clever with the rules.\r\nHestia: Anyway, with that out in the open, just what are you outsiders? I can tell a lot, but not quite that much. And can you tell me what you know about those monsters too?\r\nHiyori: Sorry for keeping this a secret from you, Hestia. In our world, we're known as \"toji\".\r\nHiyori: And those monsters are \"aradama\". They're native to our world.\r\nMihono: Our job as toji is to defeat aradama. But when we were on a mission doing that, we fell in a hole... When we woke up, we somehow came into this world.\r\nKiyoka: We don't know how the aradama got here either.\r\nKiyoka: Still, at the very least, it seems pretty likely one of the gods summoned us here.\r\nHiyori: Right. These \"okatana\" we're using have the power to purify any aradama.\r\nHestia: Mmmmm...!\r\nKaoru: O-Oi... Is something wrong, goddess?\r\nEllen: Did you get a stomachache?\r\nHestia: Then that means, you outsiders really are my savior!\r\nMihono: Uwah, that made me jump!\r\nHiyori: Your savior...? What are you saying, Hestia?\r\nHestia: I mean, you are, aren't you? You're here to defeat those arawhatevers, which means...\r\nHestia: Once the dungeon's back to normal, my darling Bell-kun will come back home!\r\nHestia: If that doesn't make you my saviors, what would!?\r\nKaoru: O-Okay... No, I don't get it at all.\r\nEllen: But it's plain as day how happy she is about it.\r\nHestia: Go ahead and ask me for anything you need, foreginers! If it'll help you get rid of those arawhatevers, I'd be happy to lend a helping hand or two!\r\nKiyoka: W-Will you really!? Then, can you teach us how to use magic!?\r\nHiyori: ...!\r\nHiyori: (Can we actually use it too...?)\r\nHestia: Ah, sorry. I can't teach you how to do that so suddenly.\r\nKiyoka: O-Oh, okay...\r\nHestia: Yeah, but is there anything else?\r\nHiyori: ...How about this. Our number one problem in clearing out the aradama is that none of us know our way around the dungeon.\r\nMihono: Yeah, you're right about that. The moment we got in there we got lost.\r\nHestia: Hmmhmm... Then you want me to find a guide for you?\r\nHestia: Leave it to me! I know just the person who can help you!\r\n\r\nLilly: Now then, everyone, will you follow me. Ah, I'm Liliruca Arde. You can call me Lilly.\r\nHiyori: Sh-She's a kid...?\r\nLilly: I am not a kid. I'm from a race known as the Pallum. For what it's worth, I'm 15.\r\nMihono: Eh-!? She's older than me!?\r\nKaoru: She looks like that, but she's almost me and Ellen's age... Seriously?\r\nEllen: Mmm, it's a parallel world after all.\r\nHiyori: Um, by the way, Lilly...\r\nLilly: Yes, what is it?\r\nHiyori: Can you... Use magic too?\r\nLilly: Yes, a bit. Though it's not the kind that's useful in combat.\r\nKiyoka: Then, what kind of magic is it? Is it like the kind that lets you fly through the air?\r\nLilly: No, it's nothing that impressive...\r\nLilly: I guess... This is a secret from everyone besides Bell-sama and them, but since you're all from another world, I think I can tell you. However, please keep this a secret from anyone else you meet here.\r\nKiyoka: Okay, we won't tell anybody!\r\nLilly: I use transformation magic. So long as my body stays mostly the same size, I can transform myself to look like anything I want.\r\nHiyori: I see, there's transformation magic...\r\nKaoru: What's wrong, Hiyori? I thought you said you weren't interested in magic?\r\nHiyori: N-No... It's not like that...\r\nKaoru: I can understand though. If you could use transformation magic, you could do something to cover up that eternal part of yours.\r\nHiyori: Kh... I'm done talking about this. We need to keep moving forward. We don't have time to talk if we want to destroy all the aradama deeper in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: A Bad Feeling and Jagamaru-kun\r\n\r\nHiyori: Haaaaah-!\r\nAradama: GAAAAaaaa...\r\nMihono: Pant... Pant... Nice one, Juujou-san...!\r\nLilly: You're all so strong! You completely overpowered those mosnters!\r\nHiyori: Still, the spectrum meter is reacting to something. We aren't done here.\r\nKiyoka: I don't see any more aradama around though...\r\nHiyori: Kaoru, does your spectrum finder show anything?\r\nKaoru: Yeah, I'm checking it now... Tch, so that's how it's going to be.\r\nHiyori: Nn? What's wrong?\r\nKaoru: They're down, below us. It's picking something up under here. And it looks like there's loads of 'em.\r\nLilly: There's dozens of floors to this dungeon, so they must be deeper in.\r\nMihono: There's that many floors...!?\r\nKaoru: Don't worry. As far as I can tell from this thing, we shouldn't have to go that deep. Though they also don't seem to be right next to us... They couldn't make it easy.\r\nEllen: Are you feeling tired, Kaoru?\r\nKaoru: Yeah... There's open spaces here and there, but fighting in these cramped tunnels can take a lot of extra effort from me.\r\nEllen: Nenekirimaru's no good for fighting in here, huh. It's true that if you went all out, you'd cause more trouble than it's worth.\r\nKiyoka: There's a lot of side tunnels as well, so you never know where aradama could come from... It's mentally exhausting...\r\nMihono: I know what you mean...\r\nLilly: Would you all like to take a break here? With that little glowing rock of yours you can tell if the monsters come near us, right?\r\nLilly: And also, it's a rule we follow to avoid exhaustion at all costs. Because in the worst case scenario, it means you might be unable to come back out.\r\nHiyori: ...I see. Thank you, Lilly. Let's take a quick break, everyone.\r\nLilly: In that case, I can provide you with food and drinks. It's another rule of the dungeon to recover properly as you progress.\r\n\r\nMihono: Whoa, this is yummy! The outside is cold and crunchy, but the inside's still nice and hot!\r\nLilly: Those are Jagamaru-kun, which Hestia-sama herself gives all of us to eat.\r\nLilly: Please try a drink of this as well. It's effective in recovering your stamina.\r\nKaoru: Gulp, gulp... Phwaa-! Ahh, I feel alive again-!\r\nKiyoka: You know, the adventurers really are amazing. I can't believe they always come down into the dungeon like this. And you too, Lilly-san, supporting them like this.\r\nLilly: Ehehe, you think so? Though I think it's equally amazing the way you've been able to adapt coming down here for your first time.\r\nEllen: You're such a good girl, Lilly. I wish we could take you back to our world.\r\nHiyori: Uh, I think that would cause problems...\r\nHiyori: Anyway, Lilly. Could you tell us a bit more about the dungeon we're in now?\r\nLilly: Ah, I can do that. Where should I start.\r\nLilly: As I told you before, this dungeon is structured in a way with many dozens of floors. We are currently on the first floor.\r\nLilly: And as you go deeper in the dungeon, the area of each floor grows larger. For that reason, exploring each layer becomes more and more difficult.\r\nMihono: Oh. So that's why you said it's important not to waste your stamina as you keep going.\r\nLilly: Right. Ordinarily, the early floors have weaker monsters, while the stronger monsters are only found the deeper you go. However, those monsters are unthinkably strong to be appearing on the first floor.\r\nEllen: And according to the spectrum finder, there's a lot more waiting for us up ahead.\r\nKaoru: Nn? Hang on... What if the aradama keep getting tougher the deeper we go in too...? They shouldn't, right?\r\nLilly: I have no way of knowing...  The investigation the guild requested only covered the first floor.\r\nLilly: So it's unknown how much stronger those monsters could be on the next floors...\r\nKaoru: Ughh... This has bad idea written all over it.\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah...\r\nHiyori: Still, we might not be able to return home until we destroy all the aradama...\r\nHiyori: Lilly, can you give me one of those \"Jagamaru-kun\" too? It sounds like I'll need to build my stamina for the fighting ahead.\r\nLilly: Yes, here you go. There's plenty more left, so if any of you want some, feel free to ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Longing for Power\r\n\r\nKaoru: Pant... Pant... Pant... Damnit, the aradama really are getting stronger the lower we go...\r\nKiyoka: And with the floors getting wider, we have to move that much further... It's exhausting, isn't it...\r\nKaoru: At least this looks like the last floor we need to clear out. I'm not picking up any aradama lower than this...\r\nEllen: Even so, there's still lots of them left on this floor...\r\nMihono: Wheeze... Wheeze... Wheeze...\r\nHiyori: Are you okay, Mihono...?\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah... I-I can keep fighting...\r\nLilly: Everyone, you can't push yourselves to your limits. Why don't we return to the last floor, where it's safe, and have another break...\r\nHiyori: Ahh, we should... Nn? What? The spectrum meter is having a big reaction to something?\r\nKaoru: Not good, Hiyori! The aradama started moving in our direction! On top of that, I'm picking up a really big one in the middle of them!\r\nHiyori: Kh... We have to hurry, all of you!\r\nKiyoka: It's no use! The aradama are already here!\r\nAradama: GUAAAAAAAAAA-!\r\nEllen: Shit! They're coming from all sides!\r\nKaoru: Tch, what got their attention so fast...!\r\nHiyori: You don't think they were luring us in, do you...!?\r\nMihono: W-We have to fight, guys...! We can't afford to lose here...!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan...! Right, I can still...!\r\nKaoru: Yeah! Let's show them what we've got!\r\nEllen: We're not about to lose to some aradama!\r\nHiyori: Everyone...!\r\nAradama: GURURURURUR...!\r\nLilly: There's monsters in every direction! Be careful, all of you!\r\nHiyori: Lilly, stay in the center of us! Form a ring! Don't show them your backs!\r\nHiyori: (But... In our exhausted state, taking on this many aradama will be...)\r\nHiyori: (What do we do... Is there something we haven't thought of...? At this rate, before long...)\r\nHiyori: (Damnit... If only I were stronger...!)\r\nLilly: H-Here they come!\r\nAradama: GUGAAAAAAAAAAAA-!!\r\nHiyori: Kh...!\r\n???: Fusillade Fallarica!\r\nAradama: GUAAAAaaaaaa...\r\nHiyori: Wha... That power...!?\r\n???: Ha...!\r\nAradama: OOOOOooooo...\r\nLefiya: Everyone, are you unhurt!?\r\nHiyori: Ah... You two...!\r\nAis: Hestia-sama asked us to help you... This time, it's our turn to...\r\nKaoru: Ais and Lefiya, right? We owe that goddess big time.\r\nEllen: For sure! You showed up in the nick of time!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, we can do it now...!\r\nMihono: Yeah, with those two with us...!\r\nHiyori: Let's go, everyone! If we all work together, we should be able to defeat every aradama here!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Asking for the Impossible\r\n\r\nMihono: Yaaaaaah-!\r\nKaoru: Teryaaaa-!\r\nEllen: Yaah-! Hah-! Toryaa-!\r\nKiyoka: Haaaa... Taa!\r\nHiyori: Good, we're doing it! And I'll...\r\nAis: Tempest!\r\nAis: Haaah...!\r\nAradama: GUOOOOoooo...\r\nHiyori: (Slashing while powered by the wind...? ...Even if I don't want to think about it, I can't help myself...)\r\nHiyori: (If only I had that power... I'd be so much stronger than I am now...)\r\nLilly: Juujou-sama! There's a monster to your left!\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOOO-!\r\nHiyori: I-I let my guard down!\r\nAis: Mmph...!\r\nAradama: uuuu...\r\nAis: Are you okay?\r\nHiyori: I... I'm fine, sorry.\r\nAis: What's wrong...? Were you hurt...?\r\nHiyori: No, that's not it...\r\nAis: Then what is...? With how strong you are, you should have been able to beat that...\r\nHiyori: How strong I am...?\r\nAis: Nn... I can't move like you can. You're so much faster...\r\nHiyori: Are you talking about \"jin'i\"?\r\nAis: Maybe...\r\nAis: Ever since I saw you fight the first time, I've been thinking about it... How can I move like you did...\r\nAis: I'm jealous of that strength of yours...\r\nHiyori: No, I'm the one feeling jealous of you.\r\nHiyori: If I could use magic the way you do... I know now's not the time to get caught up in thought... But still, I can't help it...\r\nAis: We're both alike, I think... We both want to become stronger...\r\nAis: But, like I have my strength, you have yours... What we've experienced is completely different...\r\nAis: So, your strength is inside... Umm...\r\nHiyori: Strength has to come from within... You mean? Ahh, you might be right about that.\r\nAis: Nn...\r\nAradama: GUGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-!!!\r\nMihono: Listen to that roar...! That aradama's not like the others!\r\nKaoru: Tch, is it time for the boss fight already?\r\nHiyori: Kh... If we want to stand a chance of beating that, we'll have to deal with the surrounding aradama first.\r\nAis: Don't worry... We'll take care of any of the other monsters in your way...\r\nAis: Lefiya, can you help me...?\r\nLefiya: Of course, Ais-san! I'll begin chanting!\r\nLefiya: Proud warrior, snipers of the forest. Take up your bows before the advancing plunderers. Answer the call of your brethren and ready your arrows...\r\nAradama: GAAAAAAAAA!\r\nAis: I won't let you...\r\nAradama: OOOOOooooo...\r\nHiyori: Everyone, listen to me! Once her magic hits, we need to all attack that aradama at once! Will you match your timing with me!?\r\nKiyoka: Y-Yes...!\r\nEllen: Roger!\r\nKaoru: Can you make it, Mihono!\r\nMihono: Yep! I'll do it!\r\nAis: Lefiya, now...!\r\nLefiya: Tinge them with flame, the lamplight of the forest. Release them, the fire arrows of the fairies. Falling like rain, burn away the savages...\r\nLefiya: Fusillade Fallarica!\r\nHiyori: Let's end this battle! Everyone, use jin'i to push through!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Time to Decide\r\n\r\nHiyori: Phew... We just barely made it safely back outside.\r\nKaoru: Ughh, I'm dead tired though. I can't believe as soon as we were done with the aradama, this world's monsters started coming out.\r\nEllen: It really feels like we made it out by a hair's breadth.\r\nKiyoka: If Lilly-san hadn't shown us the shortest route, we would have been in a lot of trouble back there...\r\nMihono: Thanks for everything, Lilly-san! You saved our butts!\r\nLilly: Ehehe, this is sort of embarrassing.\r\nHiyori: I want to thank you two again as well. You saved us when you arrived. I'm grateful.\r\nAis: Nn...\r\nLefiya: You're welcome, I'm just glad we were able to help.\r\nKiyoka: Ah... But, is this going to work? We were in the dungeon, weren't we? When we first came to this world.\r\nMihono: O-Oh yeah, we were...! Don't tell me, we have to go back in there to get back to our world...\r\nKaoru: Oi oi, don't joke like that...!\r\nHestia: Fear not. The god who summoned you here wouldn't work you all that hard.\r\nLilly: Ah, it's Hestia-sama.\r\nHestia: Sorry to put you through that, Supporter-kun. You too, Wallenwhatever-kun and Elf-kun.\r\nAis: No...\r\nLefiya: Dealing with those monsters was very important to us as adventurers, after all.\r\nKaoru: So what now, goddess? How're we supposed to get back home?\r\nHestia: Now now, don't be in such a rush. Before we get to that, there's one thing I want to confirm with you outsiders.\r\nHiyori: And what's that...?\r\nHestia: Remember, before you went into the dungeon? How you said you wanted to learn magic.\r\nKiyoka: Huh? But... I thought you said you couldn't teach us so suddenly?\r\nHestia: Yes, but only so soon.\r\nHestia: You know, with a powerful enough grimoire, just reading it would be enough to let you use magic. Though something like that is too pricey for me to get my hands on.\r\nHestia: But that's not the only way to learn.\r\nHestia: Which brings me to my point. Hey, outsiders, how'd you like to be a part of my familia?\r\nKiyoka: Hestia-sama's familia...?\r\nEllen: First off, what's a familia?\r\nHestia: It means my household.\r\nHestia: If you were to join my household, I could begin giving you outsiders the grace of gods, Falna.\r\nHestia: Whether or not that'll give you magic depends on the person, but if you kept working as an adventurer, you might someday get your hands on a grimoire, you know?\r\nHestia: So, how about it? So long as you promise not to lay a hand on Bell-kun, I'll welcome you with open arms.\r\nKiyoka: Umm... I do want to use magic, but...\r\nMihono: Yeah... But...\r\nEllen: Mmm... It's a tempting offer though...\r\nKaoru: Yo-? What do you think, Hiyori?\r\nHiyori: I...\r\nHiyori: No, I should stop.\r\nHiyori: What happened today helped me understand. In order to become stronger, I should improve my own skills first.\r\nHiyori: Besides, there's something I need to do in our world. You all feel the same, don't you?\r\nKaoru: Well, yeah. Besides, staying behind here as an adventurer sounds like a whole lot of work.\r\nEllen: We've all kind of said it, but I love our world too much to stay, so there's nothing I can do but give up on magic.\r\nMihono: Me too. I wouldn't want Chii-nee to get all worried about me.\r\nKiyoka: Fufu, that's right.\r\nHestia: Is that so? Well, I wasn't expecting you to go along with it anyway.\r\nHestia: Anyway, this is farewell, outsiders. Oops, looks like it's already starting.\r\nLilly: Goodbye, everyone! It made me very happy the way you praised me back then!\r\nLefiya: We need to say our thanks as well! Thank you very much for defeating those monsters, for the sake of this world!\r\nAis: If there's ever another chance...\r\nHiyori: Thanks, Ais. It's because of you that I was able to reexamine myself. If we ever meet again... I'll look forward to it.\r\n\r\nHiyori: ...Nn, where are we?\r\nMihono: Huh? Why were we sleeping out here?\r\nKiyoka: Now that you mention it...\r\nKaoru: Ahh... I feel like I had a long dream...\r\nEllen: You did? What a coincidence, I had one too.\r\nHiyori: I feel the same way, but... Nothing. I can't remember anything about it.\r\nHiyori: (But, that's strange...? I suddenly feel the need to train with Kanami...)\r\nHiyori: (Fu... Well, it's not so bad once in a while. When I get back, I'll ask her.)"}, {"paste_key": "xDYTsF84", "title": "Assemble!

Is there any need for a unit like this...\r\nYukari: Currently, there is a mixed unit from all the Five Traditions on a mission to investigate the Akabane swords. If all goes well, the number of okatana in our possession should steadily rise from here.\r\nYukari: In which case, we may find that there aren't enough toji to pair with these okatana.\r\nYukari: In order to protect the people, the more toji we have, the better. If we use this unit wisely, there's a chance it will increase the number of toji applicants.\r\nMaki: Still...\r\nYukari: Do you disapprove? Maki.\r\nMaki: ......\r\nMaki: No. If you make the order, Yukari-sama, I will use all the power given to the elite guard to fulfill it. I have no complaints.\r\nYukari: Good. Then, begin at once.\r\nMaki: Understood. I will prepare a unit capable of accomplishing this mission. The Special Ritual Riot Squad Distinguished Publicity Unit--\r\nMaki: Hereby known as, the Toji Cheer Squad!!\r\n\r\nTakatsu Yukina: Just now, Yukari-sama sent an order down to each of the Five Traditions. A toji from each school will undergo a selection exam to take part in a unit undergoing a special mission.\r\nYukina: Sayaka, you are my masterpiece. This is a chance to prove the vast difference between you and these other toji.\r\nYukina: Pass their selection, and be acknowledged by Yukari-sama.\r\nSayaka: I will. This special mission... What is it about?\r\nYukina: Cheerleading.\r\nSayaka: ............Cheer leading?\r\n\r\nMaki: Has everyone arrived?\r\nEllen: Yes! Everyone's here!\r\nNaruse Miki: Though everyone is just the five of us, isn't it~?\r\nYui: I'm here, I'm here! When I heard they wanted someone for such a delicious event, I threw both my hands up!\r\nMai: Ah, you're here too, Sayaka-chan?\r\nSayaka: Mm. President Takatsu ordered me to be here.\r\nMaki: Osafune's Kohagura Ellen, Heijou's Naruse Miki, Ayanokouji's Yamashiro Yui, Minoseki's Yanase Mai, Renpu's Itomi Sayaka--\r\nMaki: So you five are each school's nominees.\r\nEllen: Makimaki? What are the five of us going to be doing here? We came all the way to this inn out in the mountains.\r\nMaki: You should have heard; all of you are applicants nominated to join the Toji Cheer Squad.\r\nMaki: In order to advertise the position of toji, this squad will improve our image.\r\nMaki: As this is a direct proposal from Yukari-sama, I won't accept any half-hearted effort. You'll acquire the skills necessary to put on the perfect cheerleading performance.\r\nMaki: To make that happen, you'll now be participating in a special cheerleading training camp!\r\nYui: Camp! So I'll be camping under the same roof with all these cuties...!\r\nYui: Ahh, I-I'm not sure I'll be able to control myself! I'll apologize in advance! If anything happens, sorry!\r\nMaki: If anything happens... Like what, exactly?\r\nMiki: I think it's best not to pry into that. At least, that's what my intuition's telling me.\r\nMaki: Hm... Well, fine.\r\nMaki: One week from now, Yukari-sama herself will be coming to inspect your performances.\r\nMaki: If she approves of you, only then will you be officially accepted into the Toji Cheer Squad.\r\nEllen: This sounds like fun. If we're going to do it, we might as well give it our best shot!\r\nMiki: Though, cheerleading doesn't exactly sound like a toji's work, does it...\r\nMaki: Naruse Miki. This was a direct order from Yukari-sama herself. I won't allow you to take it lightly.\r\nMiki: I-I understand that~. So please stop glaring at me..\r\nSayaka: ...I'll do my best.\r\nMaki: Good. Starting now, all of you should aim to become the ultimate cheerleaders!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Cheerleaders, in Training!\r\n\r\nMaki: We'll start with your stamina! Run for one hour through the mountains. Afterwards, we'll do squats, sit ups, and push ups.\r\nMiki: Pant~ pant~... Why... Are we doing something so sporty...?\r\nEllen: Cheerleading works as a sort of endurance match too!\r\nSayaka: I'll do my best.\r\n\r\nMaki: Next you'll be learning the fundamental techniques. Beginning with stunts, and then forming a pyramid!\r\nMai: Stunts...?\r\nMaki: Stunts are a part of the act as a cheerleader. A pyramid is made up of a combination of stunts. Now, let's get started!\r\nMiki: Th-This got hard all of a sudden...\r\nSayaka: I'll do my best.\r\n\r\nAnd so their practicing continued... After several days passed...\r\n\r\nMaki: Jump, step, watch those feet! Focus!\r\nMaki: Good, stop. You all seem like you're getting used to this.\r\nEllen: I could do this much before breakfast!\r\nMaki: Though-- Itomi Sayaka. Your movements are perfect, but there's still a stiffness that you can't get rid of.\r\nSayaka: Stiffness...?\r\nMaki: According to my cheerleading textbook, showing emotion through your expression is essential... You need to work on that from now on.\r\nSayaka: ...\r\n\r\nYui: Who wants to get in the bath with me!? The bath! We should all take a bath, you know! Have to take one right away!\r\nMiki: Why are you still so worked up...?\r\nSayaka: ...\r\nMai: What's wrong, Sayaka-chan? You look down.\r\nSayaka: Shidou Maki told me before... I can't get rid of my stiffness.\r\nSayaka: I thought I was doing everything right. But, I'm missing something... I don't know what to do.\r\nMai: We all only just started cheerleading. I don't think you should worry about it so much.\r\nSayaka: But President Takatsu said I have to get Origami Yukari's acknowledgement and become a cheer toji. I have to do my best...\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan...\r\nMai: I know! In that case, why not get some pointers from someone more skilled? You might learn something useful.\r\n\r\nThe next day--\r\n\r\nSayaka: Shidou Maki. Please teach me some pointers.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan is worried... She wants to hear some advice from you.\r\nMaki: ...Sorry. I don't know anything about cheerleading myself, so I can't teach you anything that's not in the textbook...\r\nMiki: Eh-! Is that true!?\r\nYui: That won't do~. If you want to teach someone, you have to be able to do it yourself!\r\nYui: Ahh, seeing Shidou-san dancing around cheerleading... I'd pay to see that! In fact, I need to see it, pant, pant...!\r\nMaki: No, I'm not going to be one of the cheer toji; I'm just your coach and judge... There's no need for a coach to master the sport.\r\nEllen: Makimaki, there's a phone call for you.\r\nMaki: ...For some reason... I have a strong feeling that I shouldn't answer this...\r\nSuzuka: Hello, Maki-san?\r\nMaki: Yes. What's going on, Suzuka.\r\nSuzuka: Yukari-sama asked me to pass along a message to you just now.\r\nSuzuka: \"I forgot to mention this, but you're also assigned to participate as a member of the cheer toji.\" ...Is the message she left me.\r\nMaki: What... Did you say...!?\r\nYui: Hooray-! Now Shidou-san has no choice but to be a cheerleader with us!\r\nMaki: Kh...!\r\nSayaka: ...Shidou Maki wasn't a cheerleading expert... Who else knows how...?\r\nMai: What about Naruse-san and Yamashiro-san?\r\nMiki: Eh, you want me to teach you? I'm hardly any better.\r\nYui: I've been too busy watching the other girls cheering with all they've got, so I'm not that confident in my own skills.\r\nMai: Then that leaves... Ellen-chan?\r\nEllen: Hm? You need me?\r\n\r\nEllen: Yeah, yeah, yeah! Finish!\r\nMai: Wow, Ellen-chan, your cheering is so good!\r\nEllen: Fu fu fu! America is the home of cheerleading, after all! Of course I'm good at it!\r\nSayaka: I don't think that's the reason though... But Ellen is the best.\r\nSayaka: Ellen, teach me the techniques for cheerleading.\r\nMai: And I'll practice with you. If that's alright with you, Ellen-chan.\r\nEllen: It's okay! Just leave it to me!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Final Exam\r\n\r\nAnd so, after several days--\r\n\r\nEllen: Right, left, right, left, do a spin, and jump!\r\nSayaka: ...I did it.\r\nMai: I think I did it right too.\r\nEllen: Excellent! You two are in perfect sync.\r\nEllen: And you, Saaya, your stiffness from before is gone! Very good!\r\nSayaka: Thank you. It's because you taught me.\r\nEllen: Non non, Saaya. I didn't do anything.\r\nSayaka: But you're the one who taught me how to get better.\r\nEllen: You've always been so physically fit, Saaya, so your cheerleading techniques were already perfect.\r\nEllen: But your expression was too stiff. You looked like a beautiful doll, being puppeteered around...\r\nSayaka: I did...?\r\nEllen: But when you were with Maimai, you were making such a happy face. So Maimai is actually the reason you're doing better!\r\nEllen: If you want to thank anyone, you should be thanking her.\r\nSayaka: I see... Mai, thank you.\r\nMai: Eh!? I-I didn't do anything though.\r\nEllen: Ahaha, looks like Maimai's the perfect medicine for Saaya after all!\r\nEllen: When you two were cheering just now, you were so coordinated you looked like sisters!\r\nSayaka: If Mai were my sister... That wouldn't be bad.\r\nMai: S-Sayaka-chan!?\r\n\r\nMaki: Today marks the end of the training camp. Finally, Yukari-sama herself will be judging all of you. If she approves, you will be officially admitted into the Toji Cheer Squad.\r\nYukari: This is an official mission you have been assigned as toji. Show me your fullest potential, the same as you would if you were suppressing aradama.\r\nEllen: Are you going to be cheering too, Makimaki?\r\nMaki: I've been practicing every waking moment since then... As a member of the elite guard, failure here isn't an option.\r\nYukari: Now then, one by one, show me your performances as a cheerleader.\r\n\r\nYukari: Good, Naruse Miki. You pass.\r\nMiki: Thank you very much.\r\nMiki: Phew~, thank goodness~. If you want to stand out, you can't wait for others to go ahead of you.\r\n\r\nYukari: Yamashiro Yui, pass.\r\nYui: Yes, I did it! I had to make it into this unit to be around those cute cheerleaders, after all!\r\n\r\nYukari: Kohagura Ellen, pass.\r\nEllen: Of course!\r\n\r\nYukari: Shidou Maki, pass. That was a good performance.\r\nMaki: Thank you very much.\r\nYukari: ...If only I'd brought Suzuka here to see this.\r\nMaki: P-Please don't joke like that, Yukari-sama!\r\n\r\nYukari: Yanase Mai, pass.\r\nMai: Phew... Thank you very much.\r\nYukari: Lastly... Itomi Sayaka.\r\nSayaka: Yes.\r\nYukari: (Her expression is stiff. This type of role might not be suited for Itomi Sayaka...)\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan, relax your shoulders. I'll be here with you.\r\nSayaka: Mai... Mm, okay.\r\nYukari: (...Hm. She was able to relax herself when she needed to.)\r\n\r\nSayaka: --Finish.\r\nYukari: Good. Itomi Sayaka, you pass.\r\nSayaka: Good...\r\nMai: You did it, Sayaka-chan!\r\nSayaka: Mm. Thank you, Mai.\r\nYukari: All of you passed. You've done well, putting on these performances after such a short period of time.\r\nYukari: Now then... In the coming days, you'll have your final practical test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Formation of the Toji Cheer Squad\r\n\r\nEllen: So our final test is putting us in actual combat!\r\nMaki: Recently, there's been a number of reports of aradama appearing around this stadium.\r\nMaki: If aradama appear while a game is taking place, a significant number of people in the stadium could be in danger.\r\nSayaka: If aradama do appear, we need to defeat them right away...\r\nMaki: That's how it is. For that reason, the Toji Cheer Squad will be standing by here in the stadium.\r\nMiki: On top of that, even though we're meant to be cheer toji, we're still wearing our ordinary uniforms, aren't we?\r\nYui: Sighhh~... What a letdown... I was so looking forward to everyone dressing up like cheerleaders.\r\nMai: Ahaha... Still, I'm sort of relieved. It would be a little embarrassing fighting wearing something like that...\r\nMaki: That's for sure...\r\nSayaka: --! The spectrum finder is detecting something...!\r\nMaki: Looks like the aradama are already here. Let's go!\r\nSuzuka: Stop right there!\r\nEllen: Oh, Hanahana, are you our backup?\r\nSuzuka: I'm only here to deliver these clothes. The finishing touches took longer than expected, but here you are: the official uniforms of the Special Ritual Riot Squad Distinguished Publicity Unit.\r\nMaki: What... Are these...!?\r\nEllen: WOW! Real cheerleader uniforms!\r\nSayaka: Mm...\r\nMai: This is what cheerleaders have to wear, is it...\r\nYui: Yessssss!! Cheerleader uniforms for everyone! I can't believe my eyes!\r\nMiki: Don't get too excited...\r\nSuzuka: You'll carry out your mission while wearing these, everyone.\r\nSuzuka: And Yukari-sama has asked me to remind you to do your cheerleading performance after you're done fighting.\r\n\r\nSeveral days later--\r\n\r\nKanami: Check it out, Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan! They put up a video of the cheer toji on the internet!\r\nSayaka: It's true.\r\nMai: So they recorded it after all... When we were fighting wearing that.\r\nSayaka: The number of views... Is a lot. It's over one million.\r\nMai: They said cheerleading would improve our image and make others want to join... But is this really going to make more girls want to be toji...?\r\nKanami: I'm sure it will! I mean, see how cute you all look!\r\nKanami: Oh, see, this is the part where you and Sayaka-chan started cheering after beating that aradama.\r\nSayaka: ...Mm, I get it.\r\nMai: ? What do you mean, Sayaka-chan?\r\nSayaka: I... Had more fun than I thought.\r\nSayaka: (I'm glad I was able to do what President Takatsu asked me to... But, doing it with my friends... Was a little fun too.)"}, {"paste_key": "yLSLpeN2", "title": "2-8 The Mysterious Figure", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/yLSLpeN2", "timestamp": "", "hits": "96", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOotF8PxLnM\r\n\r\n1: Hiyori's Reflection (1)\r\n\r\nHiyori: .........I'm sorry, mother.

Are you unsure about whether you'll quit being a toji?\r\nHiyori: ...On that night four months ago, I accomplished what my mother had wanted for so long.\r\nHiyori: Even if it's only temporary, I forced Tagitsuhime back to the netherworld. I might not have finished the job like I wanted, but with all that noro scattered, most of its power is gone.\r\nHiyori: The Special Ritual Squad will eventually exterminate all the aradama left behind across Kanto.\r\nIroha: Your fight is over, isn't it, Hiyori-chan. Is that why you're thinking of retiring?\r\nHiyori: ...I'd rather stay until Tagitsuhime's true body is destroyed. But...\r\nIroha: We haven't found a trace of it, have we?\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nIroha: You know, Sana-chan got in touch with me from Kamakura not long ago.\r\nHiyori: You mean... Director General Maniwa?\r\nIroha: She wanted your help again; asking for you personally. But the situation is a bit complicated, you see...\r\nHiyori: Why's that?\r\nIroha: After defeating aradama, I've heard the noro retrieval teams have been attacked in several places.\r\nHiyori: You mean, by aradama?\r\nIroha: That's the problem... It seems there's a toji behind it. A strange toji covered by a hood.\r\n\r\nAcademy Intercom: Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--\r\nHiyori: ...Aradama, huh.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan! There's aradama! Are you ready to go!?\r\nHiyori: ...Kanami, at least knock first.\r\nKanami: Ah- sorry! I was right by your room when they made the announcement, so I...\r\nHiyori: ...It's fine.

Hiyori-chan, did you say something?\r\nHiyori: --You're hearing things. I'm going back to the dorm.\r\nKanami: Huh? Are you mad or something? Is this because I didn't knock when I came in your room before?\r\nHiyori: I am not mad.\r\nKanami: Ehh, you're definitely mad. Were you maybe doing something in your room you didn't want me to see?\r\nSayaka: Doing something in your room you don't want others to see...?\r\nHiyori: ...Kanami, just shut up.\r\nKanami: But, what would you be doing that you don't want anyone seeing? Were you using chocolate mint for something?\r\nHiyori: ...Kanami. A while ago, you said you wanted to settle things with me, didn't you?\r\nKanami: Eh-, hey, Hiyori-chan, why're you drawing your okatana...?\r\nHiyori: Listen up, Kanami. I am not mad about anything. I just want to settle things with you.\r\nKanami: You're making a really scary face, Hiyori-chan! I knew it, you are mad!\r\nHiyori: You won't mind if I use fourth layer jin'i, do you?\r\nKanami: The one you used to suppress Tagitsuhime!? You're going to bury me at the bottom of the netherworld!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: What We Can Do (1)\r\n\r\nKanami: It's been over four months since the leakage issue happened, right...?\r\nKanami: I wonder if there's anything we can do to help settle it faster...\r\nHiyori: Sharpen your skills, so when the missions come you can destroy every aradama you see. That's all there is for us to do.\r\nSayaka: Kanami, you shouldn't think too much about it.\r\nHiyori: You heard her. There's nothing wrong with leaving the complicated parts to others.\r\nHiyori: At the tournament, when I went to kill Origami Yukari, you followed after me. You don't need logic when you know you're right.\r\nSayaka: It's not like you to think so much, Kanami.\r\nKanami: Okay... Okay! You're right, I shouldn't be getting lost in my thoughts like this!\r\nAcademy Intercom: Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--\r\nHiyori: Sounds like there's more aradama. Let's sortie.\r\nSayaka: Let's do our best suppressing aradama.\r\nKanami: Shoot first, ask questions later, right? Thanks, you two!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: What We Can Do (2)\r\n\r\nHiyori: --Mission complete.\r\nSayaka: The three of us have gotten used to fighting together.\r\nHiyori: That's true. Compared to when I first transferred here, our coordination is much better.\r\nKanami: I know! With you two with me, I feel like we can handle any mission, no matter how tough!\r\nSayaka: ...Mm.\r\nHiyori: Still, don't get too comfortable. Carelessness is the greatest enemy.\r\nKanami: I know! We'll work just as hard tomorrow!\r\nAoto Hina: ...Sayaka-san. Can I talk to you for a minute?\r\nSayaka: ......?\r\nHina: There's an order for you to be transferred to Gunma, starting tomorrow.\r\nKanami: Eh...!!\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nKanami: But we were just starting to work together better...\r\nHiyori: There's no helping it. Getting transferred is a part of a toji's work.\r\nKanami: You're right! There's aradama all over Kanto, after all!\r\nKanami: Sayaka-chan! As long as this mission goes on, I know we'll run into each other again! So until then, let's both keep at it!\r\nSayaka: ...Mm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Personnel Reinforcements (1)\r\n\r\nIn the mountains of Gunma Prefecture.\r\nHere, where Mashiko Kaoru was commanding a unit that Itomi Sayaka was deployed to, an incident occurred causing the other toji to be hospitalized. One week has passed since.\r\nPresently, the unit of two toji and one pet led by Mashiko Kaoru consists of herself as captain, Itomi Sayaka, and Nene--\r\n\r\nSayaka: Kaoru... Captain. I look forward to working with you again today.\r\nKaoru: Yeah, sure. But stop acting so formal with me.\r\nKaoru: ...You keep calling me captain, but right now this unit is just you and me.\r\nSayaka: That's because the others were injured and had to leave.\r\nKaoru: If you hadn't shown up, I'd be the only one here now...\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nKaoru: Ahh, me and my pet, I mean.\r\nNene: Nene-!\r\nKaoru: Ever since we fought Tagitsuhime, they've been passing me around for months nonstop. They owe me a vacation already...\r\nKaoru: ...Though it's no use complaining to you, huh. We should get started with our mission for today. Even including Nene, it's just the two of us, but let's call roll.\r\nSayaka: One.\r\nChie: Two.\r\nKiyoka: Three.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nKaoru: Great, we're all here. --Wait, we doubled!?\r\nKaoru: You two... You're the ones who came to help in the raid on the Origami house, right?\r\nChie: That's us. We've been deployed here as your reinforcements. I'm Setouchi Chie, a third year high schooler from Osafune Girls' Academy.\r\nKiyoka: And I was deployed here for the same reason, Musumi Kiyoka, a second year middle schooler from the Heijou Institute.\r\nKaoru: Thank god... My unit got some reliable new faces...\r\nKaoru: Alright, good news. Today's mission has been postponed. We're gonna get right to giving our new members a welcoming party.\r\nChie: Are you being serious, Kaoru-san...? We can't just put off our mission like that...\r\nNene: --!! Ne-!! Ne-!!\r\nKaoru: Huh? What's wrong, Nene?\r\nAradama: GURURUUUUUUUU...!\r\nKaoru: ...Aradama? Guess we don't have a choice. I want to start the party, but it looks like it'll have to wait until we clear this place out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Personnel Reinforcements (2)\r\n\r\nKaoru: 'kay, that's all of them are taken care of.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nChie: Hyah!? This little guy jumped right into my chest...!?\r\nKaoru: Figures Nene would like Chie's breasts the most. Well, it goes without saying she's the best on offer here.\r\nChie: What...!? He's so cute, but, somehow I'm not very glad about him growing attached to me...\r\nKaoru: Having big tits is a virtue, right? You should be happier.\r\nChie: Well I'm not!!\r\nKiyoka: Did you know, Shichinosato-san calls her \"Chichie\"...\r\nKaoru: Chichie...? --Ah, cause she's \"SetouChi Chie\". She's got good tastes.\r\nChie: Kaoru-san! Don't go along with it so easily! Besides, it isn't in good taste at all!\r\nKaoru: It's been a while since it was this lively around here. Nene seems happy about it too. Setouchi Chie, Musumi Kiyoka, I'm glad to have you aboard.\r\nNene: Nenenne-!\r\nChie: That happiness doesn't feel very innocent, though...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Welcoming Party (1)\r\n\r\nKaoru: Okay, today for sure we're having Chie and Kiyoka's welcoming party. Though, just so nobody thinks we're slacking off, we'll be doing a leisurely patrol of the area for fun.\r\nKaoru: This way, even though we're just taking a stroll through the mountains, they'll still think we're searching for aradama.\r\nChie: You don't even try to hide what you're after, do you Kaoru-san...\r\nSayaka: Captain Kaoru is very lazy, so it's rare for her to offer doing a patrol.\r\nKaoru: Well there's nothing to do for fun around here besides get in the hot springs and play table tennis. We already get in the springs every night, and I've never beaten Sayaka once at table tennis, so screw that.\r\nKiyoka: I didn't think you were so selfish, Kaoru-san...\r\nKaoru: Huh? Want to say that again, Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: I didn't mean it!\r\nKaoru: Anyway, our scouting mission starts here. I know it all looks the same, but at least try to remember the terrain and where there's spring water.\r\nKaoru: So long as you can get the gist of the mountain, you can get an idea of where you are without checking your phone. It's tough looking at your phone in the middle of fighting aradama, after all.\r\nChie: I see! You're so knowledgeable, Captain!\r\nKiyoka: That'll come in handy...!\r\nKaoru: Fufu, you know it. Now let me show you the shortcuts you can take using game trails.\r\nNene: Ne-!! Ne-!!\r\nKaoru: Nn? What is it, Nene?\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nKaoru: ...Oh man, we'll have to put our stroll on pause. We're suppressing this aradama!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Welcoming Party (2)\r\n\r\nKaoru: Alright, back to our stroll.\r\nSayaka: ...Captain Kaoru. Are we really doing this for fun?\r\nKaoru: Huh? What are you getting at?\r\nSayaka: You're teaching us about the mountain, Captain Kaoru.\r\nKaoru: ...So you're on to me.\r\nKaoru: I mean, even if I'm the captain, there's a good chance I could get transferred away at any time.\r\nKaoru: So I thought I'd teach you the tricks to fighting aradama around here while I still can. In my own way, it's still a welcoming party.\r\nChie: Thank you for throwing us such a wonderful welcoming party, Captain.\r\nKiyoka: I'll do my best for you after you get transferred, Captain.\r\nSayaka: Captain Kaoru, take care. When are we having the going away party?\r\nKaoru: Hey, I never said for sure I was going to get transferred away.\r\nKaoru: Or wait, are you saying you want me to go...? You don't mean it like that, right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: The Hooded Toji\r\n\r\nKaoru: ...Chie, Kiyoka. I should warn you about something serious that happened here, about a week before you two came.\r\nChie: Something serious?\r\nKaoru: This is highly classified stuff, but you'll find out about it sooner or later, so I'll tell you while I can.\r\nKaoru: Lately, there's been this strange hooded toji going around attacking toji and taking the noro they collected. Not long ago, our unit was attacked and our noro stolen.\r\nKaoru: The reason this unit is just me and Sayaka is, when we were attacked, everyone else was too injured to stay.\r\nKaoru: --And we found out who the hooded toji is: the former elite guard member, Shidou Maki.\r\nKiyoka: Eh-!?\r\nSayaka: We got there after everyone else had been beaten...\r\n\r\nSayaka: ...Kaoru, there. Everyone's on the ground.\r\nKaoru: What happened! --Oi! Guys! Tell me you're still breathing!?\r\nKaoru: ...Good. Seems like they're just unconscious.\r\nMaki: ......\r\nSayaka: ...Kaoru. That's Shidou Maki...\r\nKaoru: What-!? Don't tell me, you did this!?\r\nMaki: ......\r\nKaoru: Ah-! Hey! Get back here!\r\nSayaka: Kaoru... I don't see the noro anywhere...\r\nKaoru: Shit-!! That bitch...!!\r\n\r\nKaoru: ...And that's what happened. Chie, Kiyoka. Be on the lookout for the hooded toji. You never know when you might get attacked.\r\nKiyoka: I don't believe it... A former member of the elite guard, stealing noro... Why would she do that...\r\nChie: ...By the way, Kaoru-san. Why would you tell us that story now?\r\nKaoru: Well actually, me and Sayaka got orders to transfer to Kamakura. So we'll be saying goodbye to you two today.\r\nKiyoka: I had... No idea. We were just starting to get along, so that's too bad.\r\nKaoru: We knew we wouldn't stay together here forever. That's why I tried to teach you everything I could about this mountain.\r\nKaoru: Chie, Kiyoka. I'm counting on you to look after this place.\r\nKiyoka: R-Right!\r\nChie: You're leaving it in good hands."}, {"paste_key": "VEJXnVTH", "title": "2-9 For Those Smiling Faces", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/VEJXnVTH", "timestamp": "", "hits": "103", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g3CnOt5aH0\r\n\r\n1: Kaoru's Teachings (1)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: ...Sigh.\r\nChie: What's the matter, Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKiyoka: It's been five days since Kaoru-san and Itomi-san left, and I was just wondering if we're never going to get reinforcements...\r\nChie: They're shorthanded everywhere you go, so it's no wonder. We'll just have to make the best of it together for a while, okay?\r\nKiyoka: You're right...\r\nKiyoka: --! Chie-san! I'm picking something up on the spectrum finder! There's aradama nearby!\r\nChie: Let's see, the quickest way to where the aradama is... We should be able to use the game trails Kaoru-san showed us.\r\nKiyoka: Thank goodness for the detailed map she left us during our walk.\r\nChie: Yes! Let's go, Kiyoka-chan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Kaoru's Teachings (2)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: With how quick we were able to get here, we must have been able to stop the aradama before they did any damage to the surrounding area.\r\nChie: You can thank Kaoru-san sharing the lay of the land with us for that.\r\nChie: She might be exceptionally lazy, but she sure has her heart in the right place.\r\nKiyoka: I'm glad we had a captain like Kaoru-san.\r\nKiyoka: Speaking of which, Kaoru-san said \"Soak up in the onsen after working, it's what it's there for.\"\r\nChie: I remember. Why don't we stick to Kaoru-san's word and head to the hot springs?\r\nKiyoka: At first I thought it would be terrible being assigned to work out in the mountains like this, but I get the feeling it's a lot more pleasant here than other places.\r\nChie: I think so too... I hope Mihono-chan is staying out of trouble...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Hard Work (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: Sigh... Why do I feel like I've done nothing but work these past four months... I wanna laze around every once in a while...\r\nHana: They hardly give us any free time, after all. There's even so little time to sleep that I've started taking naps in the car. The fatigue just keeps building up.\r\nHana: Still, they need us now more than ever, so we can't neglect our work...\r\nYui: The only thing that's kept me feeling alive these past four months is taking baths together with you two...\r\nHana: Mm. Even in these unforgiving conditions, it's good that we've found ways to not lose hope.\r\nYui: You mean it? Then, will you let me wash your backs again tonight?\r\nHana: It makes things easier on me, in fact I'd prefer it, but why are you so eager to wash others before yourself?\r\nYui: If I tried to explain it could make things difficult, but let's just say it's a hobby of mine? I mean, girls' bodies are so soft and nice.\r\nHana: So your hobby is caring for others? Well, you have an admirable heart.\r\nMihono: What's this feeling... It's like Yui and Hana are reading the same page from different books...\r\nMihono: Though, while we're talking about hope, I think mine is looking forward to having that rematch with Kanami.\r\nHana: Mihono and Yui, you're both so strong willed. If you two weren't with me, I don't think I'd be able to last on a mission like this.\r\nHana: I shouldn't have said that... The oldest one here shouldn't be complaining as much as I am.\r\nYui: No way, I feel the same. I couldn't keep going without the both of you.\r\nMihono: And I'm the same way. We've gotta keep supporting each other through this!\r\nHana: -! The spectrum finder's reacting! More aradama must have appeared!\r\nMihono: That's the end of our break, I guess. ...Alright! Back to work!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Hard Work (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Phew... We managed to get it all under control. You know, it feels like we've been stepping our game up like crazy these past couple of months!\r\nYui: Every day's been rough on us, but so long as we suppress the aradama, none of the ordinary girls around here are getting hurt.\r\nHana: I don't think you have to specify girls. We've been making sure there's less casualties of all kinds.\r\nHana: And there isn't an endless supply of aradama either. The longer we keep this up, the better the situation will become.\r\nYui: You said it! Anyway, with all the aradama exterminated, what do you say we hop in the bath! I want you two stripped and showing me all you've got!\r\nMihono: There's something weird about the way you phrase things, Yui... I sort of don't want to take my clothes off around you...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Misunderstanding (1)\r\n\r\nTV (Interviewer): Today, we will be asking people on their street how they feel about the Kamakura Special Hazardous Waste Leakage Issue.\r\nTV (Civilian): I've lost all faith in the Sword Administration Bureau. Get the situation under control already.\r\nTV (Civilian): I... Because of all the aradama about, I can hardly sleep at night. It's been like that here all this time!\r\nTV (Civilian): They're going to make the Sword Administration pay for all the damages we've suffered because of the aradama, right?\r\nTV (Interviewer): As you can see, a great number of people are showing open anger towards the Sword Administration Bureau as a result of the leakage issue.\r\n\r\nMihono: Come onnn-! What are they talking about!? None of them even know what's going on-!!\r\nYui: Watching the news again, Mihono-chan? You're such an M.\r\nMihono: M...?\r\nHana: What she means is that all you're doing is hurting yourself trying to gather information.\r\nHana: Besides, when they do these street interviews, they edit it so the only people who appear are those who agree with their position. Think about it, you didn't see anyone in there defending toji, did you?\r\nHana: They're trying to manipulate the public into thinking the Kamakura Special Hazardous Waste Leakage Issue is the toji's fault.\r\nHana: The people defaming the Sword Administration Bureau are just looking to get some money out of it, don't you think?\r\nMihono: Still, they can't get away with this...! All the toji are working as hard as they can!!\r\nYui: You're so pure, Mihono-chan... Makes me want to dirty you up a little...!\r\nMihono: What are you talking about, Yui. I'm already filthy...\r\nYui: Eh-!?\r\nMihono: I fell right in the mud on our last mission. I just wanna get in the bath already!\r\nYui: Uh, I wasn't talking so literally...\r\nSTT Officer: Attention all toji! Aradama have appeared in the nearby area! Please get ready to sortie!\r\nMihono: Understood! Guys! We have to go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Misunderstanding (2)\r\n\r\nSTT Officer: Asakura-san! Yamashiro-san! Suzumoto-san! You did good work again today!\r\nMihono: Eh-!? Why do you know our names...?\r\nSTT Officer: Of course I'd know who you are! Japan owes you a great debt for keeping it safe!\r\nHana: You're exaggerating; we're not anyone that special.\r\nSTT Officer: No I'm not! I saw the broadcast on TV too, and I think it's terrible what they're saying!\r\nSTT Officer: Everyday people might be misunderstanding the cause of the leakage incident, but we know it's not your fault!\r\nSTT Officer: You're all the heroes protecting this nation!\r\nHana: See, Mihono? There really are people out there who understand.\r\nMihono: I guess so! I'm not going to pay attention to the TV for a while!\r\nYui: Fufu. I want to point out toji are girls, so we're heroines, not heroes, but I guess now's not the time for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Troubles\r\n\r\nMihono: ...What we did back then. When we suppressed Tagitsuhime, did we do the right thing?\r\nHana: ...Why do you feel that way?\r\nMihono: I mean, after how we suppressed Tagitsuhime, everything got a lot worse than before, didn't it? So I'm not really sure about it anymore...\r\nYui: But think about it, Mihono-chan. In that case, could you have abandoned your friends back then?\r\nYui: If you were in Kanami-chan's shoes and Hiyori-chan needed you to save her, would you have let her go?\r\nMihono: --No. I'd never do something like that.\r\nYui: Right? If there's a girl in trouble, it's only natural to help her. And that means, in that situation, you picked the best possible option!\r\nHana: ...We can't change what was already done. But we can change what's going to happen.\r\nHana: All we can do now is trust in what we believe is our best option, moment to moment.\r\nHana: If things turn out poorly as a result, we only have to do what we believe is best again. That's what I've been thinking. Especially lately.\r\nMihono: I get it... I get what you mean...! Thanks, you two!\r\nYui: Though, when things are this bad with no end in sight, you start feeling regretful, don't you?\r\nHana: Yui... When the conversation's settled, please don't start it up again.\r\nYui: Ahaha, sorry about that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Attack (1)\r\n\r\nSTT Officer: Everyone! More aradama have appeared in the area! Prepare to combat them!\r\nYui: Again!? How many times does that make it today!?\r\nHana: My body feels heavy... I must be hitting my limit at this point...\r\nMihono: But, they need us toji to suppress the aradama...! So we have to do what we can and head over there!\r\nYui: You're right... For the sake of all the girls living around here...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: Attack (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Eghh... Somehow, we beat them...\r\nHana: It's too soon to celebrate. There aren't enough people to go around, so we're in charge of collecting the noro here.\r\nYui: I know, but, I'm seriously exhausted here... I feel like I could pass out at any moment... Can't we take care of the noro after a little break--\r\n???: ......\r\nYui: Huh-!? Someone shady looking just showed up out of nowhere!? Who are you!?\r\nHana: ...What if this is the mysterious toji they've been talking about; that noro thief...?\r\nMihono: Noro thief!? Why would someone do that!?\r\nHana: I'm not sure, but they've been taking the noro by force, so it can't be for any good reason.\r\nYui: Wh-What do we do? Fight her? I hate to say it, but staying standing is about all I can manage right now...\r\nMihono: You should rest up, Yui! I'll see what I can do!\r\nYui: --No way! If you're fighting, then of course I'm fighting with you!\r\nHana: And it goes without saying, me too.\r\n???: ......\r\nHana: Wha...!? When did I get cut...!?\r\nYui: I couldn't even see her sword...!? What is she...!?\r\nMihono: Yui!? Hana!?\r\nMihono: ...They aren't in the best shape, but she still took them out in an instant...! So, what am I supposed to do...!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: Gathering\r\n\r\n???: ......\r\nMihono: It's no use... I can't picture myself beating her...!! But, I have to protect Yui and Hana...!!\r\nMihono: What do I do...!! Nghh...!!\r\nChie: --Mihono-chan!! Are you okay!?\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan! We're here to help!\r\nMihono: Chii-nee and Kiyoka!?\r\nKofuki: Seriously. First time I see you in how long and you're already getting your ass kicked.\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono, can you still move? If so, take Yamashiro Yui and Suzumoto Hana and get back!\r\nMihono: Even Fukki and Mirja-san are here!! Did you come to save us!?\r\nMirja: We can talk after. Right now, we're going to defeat the hooded toji!\r\n???: ......\r\nKofuki: Ah-! Oi, get back here! Did you chicken out when you realized you were gonna lose!?\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan, don't provoke her. She's strong. If we can get out of this without fighting, we should accept it.\r\nKofuki: Tch... If you say so.\r\nKiyoka: Though, thank goodness we made it in time...\r\nKiyoka: I heard we were being transferred to a rougher area, but I was surprised to find out Hono-chan was already here.\r\nKiyoka: Chie-san and I were in the mountains in Gunma, but the aradama appearances started calming down, so we received orders to transfer here.\r\nMirja: Coincidences come in pairs. Shichinosato Kofuki and I were also ordered to transfer here just the same.\r\nKofuki: But more than wanting to bail out Mihocchi, I was hoping they'd send me somewhere busy with loads of aradama-chan to fight.\r\nKiyoka: Still, rather than a coincidence, I think this was inevitable. I'm sure that this happened because all of us wanted to be together with Hono-chan.\r\nMihono: ...Guys... Thank you so much... If you hadn't come here, I don't know what might have happened...\r\nMirja: There's no need to thank us. It's only a matter of course that toji will help each other out.\r\nChie: But I was so surprised. As soon as we were assigned here, we came across Mihono-chan fighting the hooded toji.\r\nKofuki: What's her deal, anyway? She seemed like she was pretty good with a sword.\r\nChie: ...Kiyoka-chan and I learned a little about that toji before this.\r\nMirja: You learned about that toji before? What do you mean?\r\nChie: You see, Kaoru-san and Sayaka-san, who were with us in Gunma, had their unit's noro stolen by that toji.\r\nChie: And Kaoru-san told us the identity of that hooded toji.

I can't wait; I haven't been to the beach in forever!\r\nKiyoka: I know! Thank goodness they gave us a summer break! I even bought a brand new swimsuit!\r\nMirja: I always took you for an indoor type, Musumi Kiyoka. But you seem more excited than usual?\r\nKiyoka: Ahaha... I was looking forward to this. Getting to do summer vacation things like a normal girl.\r\nMihono: Mann~, if only the rest of the investigation team could have made it.\r\nMirja: There's nothing we could do. Setouchi Chie said she was going to Okayama to visit her parents, and Shichinosato Kofuki had no interest in going on a trip.\r\nTanaka Taeko: We'll be getting off in a minute, everyone. Make sure you don't forget anything.\r\nMihono: --I won't~! Tanaka-sensei, thanks a lot for taking us here today!\r\nTaeko: It's no trouble, really. Just part of my responsibilities as a grown up.\r\n\r\nMihono: Whoa, you can really smell the saltwater!\r\nTaeko: Mm, the weather's nice. Good thing the skies are clear.\r\nKiyoka: Let's get changed and get in the water, everyone! We only get to experience this summer once, you know!\r\nMihono: Ahaha! Kiyoka's really getting into it today! Okay, let me just get my swimsuit on--\r\nBeachgoer A: Hey, I think that's an aradama coming from town!\r\nBeachgoer B: Wait, seriously!? You think it'll come this way...?\r\nBeachgoer C: Let's get out of here! We gotta find a place to hide!\r\nMihono: Aradama in the town...?\r\nTaeko: I'll confirm this with the Special Ritual Squad! I hate to ask you, but could you three make sure everything's okay in town?\r\nMihono: Ughh~ Why'd this have to happen nowww~... Alright! We'll be right there!\r\nKiyoka: Eh, ah...\r\nMirja: Musumi Kiyoka, we have to hurry!\r\nKiyoka: O-Okay...!\r\n\r\nPasserby 1: Ahhhhh! Help me---!\r\nPasserby 2: Eek! Anybodyyy!\r\nAradama: GUUOOOOO...!\r\nMihono: There they are! Aradama!\r\nKiyoka: Uuu... They really areee~... And there's a lot of them too...\r\nMirja: We won't have time to wait for support... We'll have to suppress them here!\r\n\r\nAradama: GUAAAAAAAA...\r\nMihono: Phew... That's the last of them, I think?\r\nMirja: I'm confirming that all aradama in the area of the town have been eliminated. It should be safe to remove utsushi, for the time being. \r\nRiot Officer: I'm very sorry! You had to take care of this place by yourselves...\r\nMirja: No... Defeating aradama is our duty, after all.\r\nKiyoka: Pant, pant... Why didn't any other toji arrive...?\r\nRiot Officer: Several mass outbreaks of aradama were found in the surrounding mountains... All other Special Ritual Squad personnel in the area were sent in to respond.\r\nRiot Officer: The aradama that were sighted here most likely came down from the mountains seeking inhabited areas.\r\nMirja: You sound understaffed... Have you heard anything from Headquarters? Will they be sending reinforcements?\r\nRiot Officer: About that... They're also lacking toji able to respond here in any hurry, so forming a unit of reinforcements could take some time...\r\nMihono: Mirja-san, we should go into the mountains to help stop the aradama! We can't risk the chance of them attacking people on the beach!\r\nMirja: You're right. Then, we will be mobilizing as of now. Our objective is locating the sites of the aradama outbreak, and eliminating them.\r\nKiyoka: O-Okay~...\r\nKiyoka: (Awww... My summer vacation~...)\r\n\r\n???: Fu Fu Fu...! I didn't expect to encounter them here... This is my chance to gather data on the investigation team members!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: A Call for Relief and a Hole in the Beach\r\n\r\nEllen: Oh! What a beautiful beach!\r\nNene: Nene, nene-!\r\nMai: My family's private beach is a little further up ahead.\r\nKaoru: A private beach... People actually own those in real life... I thought they were just a thing in movies and manga.\r\nHiyori: I'd heard you came from a rich family, but... No wonder Kanami suggested going to the beach.\r\nHiyori: Though, Kanami herself isn't even here.\r\nMai: Well, Kanami-chan did come down with an awful summer cold just before we left...\r\nSayaka: ...I'm kind of worried about Kanami.\r\nHiyori: Don't feel bad for her, Sayaka. It's her own fault that she doesn't take care of herself. She even sleeps with her stomach exposed; she's that bad...!\r\nMai: Ahaha... Hey, Sayaka-chan. Remember what Kanami-chan said? To have a bunch of stories to tell her when we get back.\r\nMai: If she hears that we weren't having fun because we were worried about her, I'm sure Kanami-chan will feel guilty about it.\r\nSayaka: ...Okay, I understand. I'll have fun for Kanami then.\r\nKaoru: Alright, hurry up and get your swimsuits on then--\r\nEllen: A phone call at a time like this...? Oh... It's from Sana-sensei too.\r\nKaoru: Geh, I don't wanna hear this...\r\nEllen: Hii, how's it going, this is Ellen!\r\nEllen: Okay, okay... Yes, I understand... Then, goodbye.\r\nMai: Did something come up, Ellen-chan?\r\nEllen: Sounds like there was a mass outbreak of aradama in the mountains near here.\r\nEllen: Which means-- Sorry Kaoru, but it's work time.\r\nKaoru: Tch, what the hell is the Special Ritual Squad doing?\r\nEllen: This branch and Headquarters are both very shorthanded. If they weren't, Sana-sensei wouldn't have called us while we're on vacation.\r\nKaoru: Sigh... This sucks. In the first place, are they even gonna make up for how much time this takes?\r\nSayaka: ...Mai, we should help too.\r\nMai: Right. I don't want to have come this far only to not spend our vacation together. If we all chip in, it'll go faster--\r\nVoice: Eeeeeek-!\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOO...!\r\nMai: Oh no! There's an aradama coming after her!\r\nHiyori: Leave it to me. I'll handle this. --Haah!\r\nAradama: GUAAAAAAA...\r\n???: Sigh~, my hero~!\r\nKaoru: Ah, I know her. She's a 3rd year highschooler, Watanabe Emily. Even in Osafune she's famous for being a weirdo.\r\nEmily: I'm not about to pretend like I didn't hear that! I am not a weirdo; just a bit more stalker-ish than your average person, and brimming with curiosity!\r\nKaoru: Yeah, that's what makes you a weirdo...\r\nEmily: Tohoho... I was merely sneaking after the investigation team, thinking I could acquire some data on them... How did I end up in such a dangerous situation...?\r\nHiyori: ...Somehow, I feel like she's not worth the effort.\r\nKaoru: Let's just leave her here.\r\nEllen: Of course. Once we're in the mountains, who knows where aradama might attack from!\r\nEmily: I refuse! No matter what it takes, I'll get that data on the investigation team--\r\nEllen: Heave, ho, heave, ho.\r\nEmily: What's this...? Kohagura-san, why have you started digging a hole in the beach...?\r\nKaoru: Kukuku, I wonder why-?\r\nEmily: Ah-, you don't mean to...!? ...A-Awawawwawa...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Summer Vacation Belongs to Everyone\r\n\r\nAradama: GUUOOOOOO-!\r\nMihono: Uwawah!?\r\nMirja: Hah-!\r\nAradama: GUUUUUUU...\r\nMirja: Are you unhurt, Asakura Mihono!?\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah... Thanks, Mirja-san...\r\nMirja: (This isn't good... The aradama from this outbreak are unusually strong and numerous.)\r\nMirja: (Asakura Mihono must be nearing the limit of her concentration. And then, Musumi Kiyoka...)\r\nKiyoka: Pant... Pant...\r\nKiyoka: (Why did this have to happen...)\r\nKiyoka: (It's finally summer break... This isn't what I came to the beach for...)\r\nMirja: Musumi Kiyoka, get hold of yourself! Another group of aradama is approaching!\r\nKiyoka: Huh...?\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOO!\r\nKiyoka: It's got me...!\r\nKiyoka: (I can't... It's no use...!)\r\nAradama: Gwaaaaa...!\r\nHiyori: What do you think you're doing!? Don't look away from your enemy!\r\nKiyoka: Eh...? Is that you, Juujou-san...!?\r\nHiyori: Yes. And not just me.\r\nSayaka: Hup-! Haaah-!\r\nMai: --Haa-!\r\nAradama: Gyaaa... aaa...\r\nEllen: Are you girls from the investigation team okay-!? Sana-sensei sent us to be your backup-!\r\nMirja: Osafune's President Maniwa... I'm very grateful for your cooperation.\r\nKaoru: Ah-, save that for when we're done. Damnit, just when I had the free time to mess around at the beach...\r\nMihono: Wait... You too?\r\nHiyori: Yes, we're on summer vacation. But we can't just ignore something like this happening.\r\nNene: Ne-, nene-!\r\nSayaka: I promised to eat shaved ice on the beach with Mai. So I don't want aradama stopping us.\r\nMai: Right! And it's not just us; all the regular beachgoers wouldn't be able to enjoy themselves either!\r\nKiyoka: Juujou-san, Itomi-san, and Yanase-san...!\r\nKiyoka: (That's right, everyone else is going through this too... I'm not the only one who came here to have a good time... Somehow, I hadn't realized that...)\r\nKiyoka: (But I can't keep just complaining about it!)\r\nKiyoka: Hah-- Yaaaaa-!\r\nAradama: GWAAAaaaaaa...\r\nMirja: Fu, you've finally gotten serious.\r\nKaoru: Then let's finish 'em off. If we don't hurry, the tide'll come in.\r\nMihono: The tide? What about it?\r\nHiyori: Don't mind us, it's a private matter.\r\nHiyori: Mihono, have you caught your breath? We need to quickly eliminate them here and keep moving.\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah!\r\n\r\nEmily: Is anybody there-! Can somebody help me-! They buried me in the sand and left; isn't that terrible---!\r\nEmily: Ah... Is it my imagination... Or are the waves creeping ever closer...? Does that mean this spot will be underwater in just a few hours...? Err, I don't have gills last I checked...?\r\nEmily: ...ANYBODYYYYYY---!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Before the Tide Rolls In\r\n\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOOOO!\r\nMirja: According to the spectrum finder, these are the last remaining aradama in the mountains! We'll exterminate them here!\r\nMihono: Got it-!\r\nKiyoka: Yaaaaah-!\r\nAradama: GAAAAAAaaaaaa...\r\nMihono: Nice going...!\r\nMirja: Suppression of all aradama confirmed. Good work, everyone.\r\nKiyoka: Eh? Was that the last one?\r\nEllen: You got so carried away while you were fighting, huh Kiyoka!\r\nKaoru: Yeah, you went all out. Way to go, you.\r\nKiyoka: That's all of them...? Then, our summer vacation...\r\nMai: Ah, that's right! Hey, Musumi-san? It might have been fate running into you here, so would you like to come back to the beach with us?\r\nEllen: Good idea! I'm all for it, Maimai!\r\nHiyori: The Yanase family apparently owns a private beach near here. There won't be anyone around, so we can do whatever we want.\r\nSayaka: And they have shaved ice.\r\nNene: Nene, nenene-!\r\nKiyoka: A private beach, with shaved ice...! Oh, but...?\r\nMirja: Don't worry, Musumi Kiyoka. The Special Ritual Squad will take care of the cleanup work to be done here.\r\nMihono: Yeah, we don't often get an invitation like this! Let's go, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Okay!\r\nKaoru: ...Oh. Oi, Ellen, what time is it?\r\nEllen: What time? Well, it's still a while before sunset...\r\nEllen: Ahhh-! I totally forgot-!\r\n\r\nEmily: How could you be so cruellll-! Humans can't breathe underwater, you knowwwwww-!\r\nKaoru: Uh, my bad, my bad. But it's not such a big deal, right? You only got a little wet.\r\nEllen: Sorry, we'll bury you a little further away next time.\r\nEmily: Nooooo-! Don't bury me at alllll-!\r\nMihono: We made it back to the beach so fast thanks to you, Kiyoka. You were really awesome back there.\r\nKiyoka: You're exaggerating... But...\r\nKiyoka: I've never had a chance to go on a trip with anyone during summer vacation before...\r\nKiyoka: But since I became a member of the investigation team, I got to know everyone, so I was really looking forward to this...\r\nKiyoka: Still, I'm not the only one who felt like that. Nobody wants their precious summer vacation interrupted.\r\nKiyoka: So when I thought about that, I thought I had to try extra hard for all those people...\r\nMihono: Kiyoka...\r\nKiyoka: I'm happy I got to be a member of this investigation team. Because if I hadn't, I just know I never would have realized something so simple.\r\nKiyoka: So I want to get a lot closer with everyone. Not just the investigation team of course, but with all the people I've met so far...\r\nMai: Mihono-chaaan, Musumi-saaan! If you don't put your swimsuits on soon, the sun will set before you know it!\r\nMihono: C'mon, Kiyoka! Here's your chance to get closer to Mai and the rest! Summer vacation's just getting started, after all!\r\nKiyoka: --Right!\r\n\r\nThat night, on a mountain near the coast--\r\n\r\nTaeko: Hmm...

Hey, hey, Yomi onee-san! Look, it's the sea, the sea~!\r\nYomi: Yes, it's the sea. However, we're on alert right now.\r\nYume: Come on~, act a little more excited~. Yukari-sama~, how long do we have to wait for~?\r\nYukari: Only a little longer. Maki and Suzuka should be back from inspecting the site soon.\r\nYume: But weren't all the aradama beaten yesterday? So there's no reason for us to be here, right? I keep hearing there's not enough people, so we didn't have to come all this way...\r\nYume: Since they already took care of everything, we should just play on the beach. Can't we? Yukari-sama~.\r\nMaki: ...Yume, we don't have time to play around, you know?\r\nSuzuka: That's right. We're still here on a mission.\r\nYume: Booo-, that's so boring~.\r\nYukari: Maki, Suzuka, you're back. What did the Special Ritual Squad have to say?\r\nMaki: Yes. As you know, the aradama were suppressed, and their cleanup work was finished sometime yesterday.\r\nMaki: However, not long ago, a lecturer from Minoseki, Tanaka Taeko, sent in an interesting report--\r\n\r\nYukari: ...I see. I wasn't aware this region had such a legend.\r\nSuzuka: Yes. After receiving this report, the Special Ritual Squad is currently continuing their investigation into the area.\r\nYukari: Hm...\r\nSuzuka: Hello. This is the elite guard, Kohohana Suzuka speaking.\r\nSuzuka: ...Eh!? Are you sure!?\r\nMaki: What's wrong?\r\nSuzuka: Well... The people investigating the mountainside are reporting that another mass outbreak of aradama occurred.\r\nYukari: Suzuka, tell them we'll be right there.\r\nSuzuka: By that you mean, you'll be coming too...! Yes, I understand!\r\nMaki: Yomi, Yume, are you prepared?\r\nYomi: Yes. I can go at any time.\r\nYume: Ehh~, just when I thought I'd get to play on the beach~.\r\nMaki: Yume, you're still going on about that--\r\nYukari: Leave her be, Maki. Yume, after this mission is over, you can play as much as you like.\r\nYume: No way-!? Really!?\r\nYukari: Yes, if that's what's needed to motivate you for this mission. You may be the elite guard, but that doesn't mean you're above having time off.\r\nYume: Hooray-! Then let's get alll~ of these aradama beaten already!\r\nYukari: Maki, there should be three members of the Akabane swords investigation team in the area. Send them a directive. The more help the better.\r\nMaki: Yes, right away.\r\nYukari: Then, let's move. We will now eradicate all the aradama appearing on the mountainside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Take Back Our Summer Vacation!\r\n\r\nMihono: Nnn... I thought we'd finally get to have our summer vacation, but now we're back doing this again...\r\nKiyoka: It's okay. We just have to beat all the aradama again.\r\nHiyori: You sound confident. Very different from when I found you yesterday.\r\nKiyoka: Yes. I realized something. It's only us toji who can protect the summer vacation everyone's looking forward to.\r\nKiyoka: And also, I have all of you here with me now.\r\nMirja: However, are you all sure about assisting us? You didn't receive any such order from President Maniwa this time, did you?\r\nEllen: Even so, we want to help! This ship's already sailed!\r\nMai: Mm. Let's not make this so impersonal.\r\nSayaka: When we're done, we can all play together again.\r\nMihono: Guys... Thank you so much! Makes me feel all warm inside!\r\nKaoru: ...So, why're you here again?\r\nEmily: Uhh... Wh-What's the harm in it!\r\nEmily: With this many of you toji around, you should have no trouble keeping me safe!\r\nEmily: (Fu Fu Fu...! To think, so many toji I've had my eyes on would gather in one place like this-- I'd never let this opportunity to gather data up close and personal escape me!)\r\nEllen: Oh... That's quite the evil look in your eyes. What do you think, Kaoru? Should we bury her in the beach again?\r\nEmily: No-! Never do that again!\r\nMirja: ...At any rate, why do you think these mass outbreaks of aradama are occurring around this mountain specifically?\r\nMihono: I don't know, but if we can't figure out why, the same thing might keep happening again, won't it?\r\nSayaka: Mai, do you know anything about this?\r\nMai: I don't. My family does own a private beach here, but we might only ever come here once per year... Sorry, Sayaka-chan.\r\nEmily: Fuhahahaha! It seems the time has come to prove my usefulness!\r\nKaoru: Huh? You know something about this?\r\nEmily: Yes! Actually, there's a legend of a greatly powerful large scale aradama that was once in this area!\r\nEmily: No precise records of it remain, but the legend itself has been passed down amongst the locals through oral tradition.\r\nEmily: According to them, that large aradama would lead a legion of smaller aradama in an attack on the nearby village. But each time, the local toji would exterminate the smaller aradama and the large one would be subdued.\r\nEmily: However, that large aradama could never be entirely suppressed, and so these conflicts continued over many generations--\r\nEmily: Until that lineage of toji was broken off. At the same time, for unknown reasons, the large aradama abruptly disappeared... Or that's how the legend goes.\r\nMirja: I see. The part about the smaller aradama certainly corresponds to the current situation...\r\nMihono: But, why do you know all that, Emily-san?\r\nEmily: Well that's simple! I only visited this town in the first place to further investigate this legend!\r\nKaoru: If it's so simple, why didn't you say something sooner, huh?\r\nEmily: As it happens, my interest shifted to something else! It completely slipped my mind! Fuahahaha!\r\nKaoru: Ahh, I'm tired of talking to you. But, that legend...\r\nEllen: Yes. It sounds like the Mashiko family, doesn't it?\r\nNene: Ne-, nene-.\r\nMihono: Eh? So then...\r\nMirja: Hold that thought, Asakura Mihono. We can continue later.\r\nAradama: GUAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nKiyoka: There they are! They look just like the type from yesterday!\r\nMihono: We'll have to take care of the aradama first, then!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Fight for the Watermelon\r\n\r\nAradama: GUAAaaaa...\r\nYukari: Good, we'll push the front-line forward. Instruct the toji in the rear to begin recovering noro.\r\nMaki: Understood! Suzuka, Yomi, Yume! From here on out, let no aradama approach Yukari-sama!\r\nYomi: I'm on it.\r\nYume: Ehh~? I'm pretty sure Yukari-sama'll be fine on her own though~?\r\nMaki: Don't be like that. As the elite guard, this is our duty to fulfill.\r\nSuzuka: She's right, Yume. As the elite guard, we are the swords which form Yukari-sama's shield.\r\nYume: If you say so... Ah, hey, by the way. Doesn't it seem like the aradama around here are only going after toji?\r\nSuzuka: Eh...?\r\nSuzuka: Now that you mention it, you may be right. The aradama could avoid us if they wanted, yet their only intent seems to be attacking us.\r\nMaki: Does that mean, with Yukari-sama's decision to push up the front-line, she anticipated this...? But why is it the aradama are only targeting toji?\r\nYukari: Maki, Suzuka, keep your guard up!\r\nAradama: O-OOOoo oo...\r\nYukari: You can't allow your mind to wander on a battlefield. Whatever the aradama's intent, we toji are here to defeat them. Think of nothing but fulfilling that objective.\r\nMaki: Yes ma'am! Suzuka, I'm counting on you!\r\nSuzuka: Of course, leave it to me.\r\nYume: Ooh~, they're getting into it~.\r\nYume: Hey-, Yukari-sama-! Since we're here together, why don't we have a contest between the two of us to see who can beat the most aradama!\r\nYume: And if I win, you'll buy me a watermelon afterwards! A big round one! You're fine with that, right-?\r\nYukari: ...Fine, I have no issue with that. But only on the condition that you obey my orders. Those are the terms of our contest.\r\nYume: Ahaha! Yes-! Then, it's about time I got serious-!\r\n\r\nAradama: GAAAAAAaaa...!\r\nYume: Ahahahaha! More and more-!\r\nMaki: Come back, Yume! You're getting too far ahead!\r\nYume: Thbbbb-. This is between me and Yukari-sama. So I don't have to listen to you, Maki onee-san!\r\nMaki: Ah-, I can't believe her...!\r\nSuzuka: When she gets like this, Yume's quite the nuisance.\r\nYukari: ...Yomi, go support Yume. However, so long as I live, let her act freely. Rather than being restricted under someone else, she can accomplish more this way.\r\nYomi: I understand.\r\nYukari: Maki, Suzuka, we're pushing forward as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Legend's Similarity\r\n\r\nAradama: GUOooo oo...\r\nMihono: Pant... Pant... Pant...!\r\nKiyoka: I think that's the last of them... For now...\r\nHiyori: Phew... Do you think we should take a break, everyone? We don't know how many aradama are lurking ahead, so we should rest while we can.\r\nMirja: You're right, we should do that.\r\n\r\nKaoru: Ahhh, I don't wanna get back up. Feels like there's way more of them than yesterday... If only somebody here would go get our stuff for us...\r\nEmily: What!? You expect me to carry your things now!\r\nEmily: \"Hooray, hooray, everyone-! You can do it, you can do it, everyone-!\" --Hasn't my cheering been enough for you?\r\nEllen: All I remember is wondering who was making that racket...\r\nSayaka: It gets busy while we're fighting, so I didn't notice.\r\nEmily: Ughh, how disheartening. I'll suppose I'm off to stare into space for a bit then.\r\nKaoru: Yeah, go right ahead.\r\nMirja: ...By the way, Yanase Mai. I'd like to ask your opinion on something, while we have the time.\r\nMai: I was about to bring something up myself. It's about the aradama, isn't it?\r\nMihono: Did you two find out anything?\r\nMirja: Actually... I'm not entirely sure of it yet, but at times the aradama we've encountered seem to be deliberately pursuing us toji.\r\nMai: Even when injured they don't try to run away, and when they're far enough that it wouldn't be odd if they ignored us, they suddenly change course to attack.\r\nMihono: Huh? Really? I didn't notice any of that.\r\nMihono: But, why would they do that? Do the aradama here only go after toji?\r\nEllen: I think the Mashiko family's story might help explain.\r\nMihono: Oh yeah, didn't you say they were sort of alike before?\r\nEllen: Yes. Kaoru will explain the details.\r\nKaoru: Oi...! Fine, if I have to...\r\nKaoru: In Tochigi, near the Futarasan shrine, \"Nene\" would go on rampages. For hundreds of years we built up a long history of fighting it.\r\nKaoru: Anyway, after all that fighting, we came to an understanding with \"Nene\"...\r\nKaoru: So what's similar is, in this legend with the big aradama, the \"toji from around here had been fighting it for countless generations\" part.\r\nKaoru: That's why I was wondering if maybe that lineage of toji had the same line of thinking as the Mashikos.\r\nMirja: To summarize, you believe that large aradama could have ended up in a similar relationship with those old toji as the current Mashiko family shares with Nene. Is that correct?\r\nKaoru: Nah, I wouldn't go that far. But it seems like the big aradama might have decided those toji were a worthy rival, right?\r\nMashiko: The proof is that, when this toji lineage ended, that's when the big aradama disappeared all of a sudden too. Without its rivals around, it wasn't interested.\r\nMirja: I see...\r\nMai: But then in this case, why would that aradama return right now...?\r\nEllen: Because it found some interesting rivals, don't you think?\r\nKiyoka: Wait, you mean... Us?\r\nKaoru: Yep. Probably.\r\nMihono: So like, the outbreak of aradama yesterday was to test our skills... Or something?\r\nMirja: Then, after making its judgment, it began to act seriously? This sounds stranger than fiction, if I'm being honest...\r\nSayaka: But the story fits. The aradama are only targeting toji.\r\nMai: Well, what do you think, Nene-chan?\r\nNene: Ne~?\r\nEllen: Seems like he's tilting his head hard in confusion.\r\nKaoru: Well, it figures.\r\nEmily: Ah-!? What's the big idea, everyone!? Why does it seem like you just had a very interesting conversation without me!?\r\nMihono: Ah, you didn't get to hear...\r\nKaoru: ...Well we can't rest forever; we should get going. \r\nEllen: Agreed.\r\nMihono: Okay-! Let's keep giving our all!\r\nEmily: Wait, this isn't fair!? Please tell me all about it too!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Origami Yukari's Seriousness\r\n\r\nYukari: ...Seems like all aradama in this area have been eliminated.\r\nYume: Yu~kari-sama~. How many aradama have you gotten so far?\r\nYukari: Forty or fifty.\r\nYume: Wait, are you guessing!? Come on, take this contest seriously.\r\nYume: If you don't know exactly how much, how're we supposed to know who won?\r\nMaki: Yume, focus on the mission at hand. If you don't, you'll screw up sooner or later, you know?\r\nYume: These aradama are never gonna hit me, so don't worry about it.\r\nSuzuka: Really, you can be such a handful. However, it does seem the theory of these aradama only targeting toji was correct.\r\nMaki: Right. Despite all the aradama we've encountered, none of the riot officers have been attacked.\r\nYukari: Maki, Yume.\r\nMaki: Ah, I'm sorry. Are we pushing forward?\r\nYukari: No... It's coming. Get ready.\r\nYume: Nn?\r\nLarge Aradama: GUAAAAAAAAAAA-!!!\r\nMaki: Wha...!?\r\nYuma: Whoa-! It's huge-!\r\nSuzuka: And not just that aradama!\r\nAradama: GURURURU...!\r\nMaki: It brought more along with it... There must be... No, it's impossible to estimate. There's too many.\r\nLarge Aradama: GUAAAAAAAAAAA-!!!\r\nYukari: You must be the legendary aradama of these parts. It seems Tanaka Taeko guessed correctly.\r\nYume: Hmmm, I don't really get it, but that big one's the boss, right?\r\nYume: Then that makes this easy, Yukari-sama. Whoever beats the boss is the winner! Hyaaaah!\r\nYume: Ahaha! It's pretty tough! But it won't last long against me~!\r\nLarge Aradama: GUAAAAAAA-!!\r\nYume: Ah-, you're running away!? --G-Get back here-!\r\nYukari: Yume, stop! Don't give chase!\r\nYume: B-But--\r\nYukari: Obey my orders. That's what you promised.\r\nYume: Urgh... Fine, I get it-!\r\nYukari: More importantly, Yume. Aside from the fleeing giant aradama, there's countless prey for you here, isn't there?\r\nAradama: GURURURU....!\r\nMaki: Yukari-sama... But what do you plan to do about the escaped aradama?\r\nYukari: We aren't the only toji responsible here. Defeating the aradama at their source is key, but our original objective was to eliminate every aradama that appeared.\r\nYukari: Considering that, are you going to ignore this number of aradama? Do you believe anyone besides ourselves could deal with all this at once?\r\nMaki: I... You have a point...\r\nSuzuka: Our place is here, Maki-san. No one aside from Yukari-sama and we elite guard can accomplish this.\r\nMaki: ...Ahh, you're right.\r\nYukari: Yomi, continue supporting Yume. However, there's no need to hold back any longer. If you feel it's necessary, destroy as many aradama as you can manage.\r\nYomi: Understood. I'll do everything in my power.\r\nYukari: Maki, Suzuka, I trust my back to you.\r\nMaki: Yes ma'am!\r\nSuzuka: Even if it costs my life!\r\nYukari: Yume. Our contest will be decided by numbers after all. Though, do you truly think you can beat me?\r\nYume: Wah, Yukari-sama's getting serious-! Ahahaha! But still, there's no way I'm gonna lose this time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Large Aradama Suppression Order\r\n\r\nKiyoka: ...Is it just me? It feels like we aren't running into as many aradama anymore.\r\nMihono: Yeah, I noticed it too... It was nonstop just a little while ago.\r\nEmily: Err, someone's phone is ringing?\r\nMihono: --Ahh, that's mine!\r\nMihono: Hello? Oh, Tanaka-sensei!\r\nMihono: Yes... Yes... Yes... Ehhh!?\r\nMihono: I got it! I'll tell the others!\r\nMirja: ...What did Tanaka-sensei have to say? You sounded rather surprised by it.\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah. Well... Yukari-sama and her elite guard's unit ran into this tough looking boss aradama.\r\nMihono: But it had a ton of other aradama with it, and suppressing them took higher priority...\r\nEllen: Then what about that boss aradama?\r\nMihono: So it sounds like it ran off somewhere. And it's up to us to beat it.\r\nKaoru: Gimme a break. What's the point if they're not gonna defeat the last boss?\r\nNene: --Nene! Ne-, nenene-!\r\nKaoru: Nene? What's with you all of a sudden?\r\nLarge Aradama: GUAAAAAAAAA-!!!\r\nHiyori: What was that!? That roar just now!?\r\nMai: It must be, that tough aradama...!?\r\nKiyoka: Um... Do you think, maybe, it's calling to us...?\r\nMihono: What... Like it's calling us out?\r\nSayaka: ...It might be.\r\nEmily: E-Err~ This might be a naive question, but, can you actually beat it? This aradama that countless generations of toji didn't destroy.\r\nMihono: Well...\r\nKiyoka: But... We have to go, don't we?\r\nMirja: Yes. No matter what sort of aradama we face, so long as it might threaten people's lives, we can't afford to leave it.\r\nKaoru: Whatever, let's get this over with... If things get rough, we'll just run away I guess.\r\nHiyori: Of course, we'll stick together to the end.\r\nMihono: Kiyoka, Mirja-san, and everybody...!\r\nMihono: Alright! Let's do this! This time for sure, we'll take back our summer vacation!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Summer Vacation Is Right Before Our Eyes!\r\n\r\nAradama: GAAAaaa aaa...\r\nYukari: ...That was the last of them. Maki, is anyone hurt?\r\nMaki: Pant... Pant... Pant... N-No... Everyone... Should be fine...\r\nSuzuka: Yukari... Sama... I'm sorry... You had to do most of the work, in the end...\r\nYume: Pant... Wheeze... Wheeze... Why don't... You have... A single drop of sweat, Yukari... Sama...?\r\nYomi: Pant... Pant...\r\nYukari: Just try not to move for a while, all of you. You fought well. Rest for now.\r\nMaki: I have no excuse... As a member of the elite guard, to be so unable to protect Yukari-sama...\r\nYukari: Maki, your sternness is a strength of yours, but not if it leads to you being overly critical of yourself.\r\nYukari: If that's how feel, you only need to become stronger. Understand?\r\nMaki: ...Yes ma'am!\r\nYume: Ah, oh yeah-- In the middle of fighting, I totally forgot to keep count!\r\nYume: Hey, Yomi onee-san. Do you know?\r\nYomi: The number of aradama you defeated, Tsubakuro-san? No, I was too busy to keep track.\r\nYume: Ehh, then...? My contest with Yukari-sama...?\r\nYomi: If we don't know the numbers, then we can't declare a winner.\r\nYume: No way~!\r\nYume: Awww~... I tried my hardest too... I really... Wanted that watermelon...\r\nYukari: Yume, don't be so down. You can buy what you want when we get back. I'll allow it.\r\nYume: Ehh!? Seriously!? Alright!\r\nYume: Hey, Onee-sans-! Let's play split the watermelon later!\r\nSuzuka: Honestly, that girl... There's simply no refusing her, is there.\r\nMaki: But Yukari-sama, will the investigation team members you ordered to suppress the large aradama be able to handle themselves?\r\nYukari: There's no need to worry. They're toji, the same as you, after all.\r\n\r\nLarge Aradama: GUAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMirja: There it is! That must be the one, from the legend--\r\nKiyoka: I-It's so big... More than I imagined...\r\nMai: Can we really win against something like that...?\r\nSayaka: ...I don't know.\r\nEmily: Hawawawawa... I propose we try for a strategic sort of retreat!\r\nMihono: Hmmm... Hey, do you think that when we beat that aradama, we might become friends?\r\nMihono: Like what happened with the Mashiko family and Nene-chan. If we come to respect each other's strength, or something.\r\nHiyori: Mihono, you... Heh, I can't tell if you're that clueless or that confident.\r\nEllen: Mihomiho doesn't have an ounce of fear in her! She's already decided we're going to win.\r\nMihono: I mean, I'm not sure how, but I'm sure we can do it!\r\nMihono: We've all been fighting together since yesterday, you know. With all of us together, I don't care who we're up against, we'd never lose.\r\nMirja: Fu... I can't call it logical or tactical, but it's certainly like you.\r\nKiyoka: I agree with Hono-chan! If we all fight together, I know we'll win!\r\nLarge Aradama: GUAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: Let's do this, everyone! Our summer vacation's right before our eyes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: One Summer's Memories\r\n\r\nLarge Aradama: GUAAAAaaaa aaaa... ........ ....\r\nMihono: Did we beat it...?\r\nMirja: Watanabe Emily. Can you check its noro?\r\nEmily: Ah, could you give me some room for a minute? Like that, thank you.\r\nEmily: Hmmhmm... Hoho, now this is interesting. There's not a single drop of noro in here!\r\nHiyori: Which means... We didn't truly defeat it?\r\nKaoru: Ahh, maybe. But that's enough, isn't it?\r\nKaoru: That aradama went all out against us and used up all its strength, so it should be quiet for a while, right?\r\nSayaka: Mm. We did what we needed to.\r\nMirja: ...That's right. Why don't we leave uncovering the truth of the matter to those of the Special Ritual Squad assigned to process this matter?\r\nMihono: What if the toji back then went through this every year?\r\nEllen: Then after repeating these heated battles every summer, eventually toji and aradama might form a bond... You never know!\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nKiyoka: Phew... At least, that's this time done with. Now...\r\nKiyoka: We can finally get back to our summer vacation!\r\nMihono: Sounds good! Then let's go right back to Mai's family's beach! I wanna play in the sea till my hands get all wrinkly!\r\n\r\nMihono: Here it comes-! Take that-!\r\nKiyoka: Kyaaa! But, I'm not giving up-!\r\nEllen: Did you hear, Hiyoyon? Apparently Yukari-sama and the elite guard are enjoying some time off just down the beach from here.\r\nHiyori: The elite guard is one thing, but Yukari-sama...? Hmph, she would never do something like that. I don't believe it one bi--pfffhtpht!\r\nEllen: Ahahaha! You were wide open!\r\nKaoru: They're sure having a good time-. But the way an adult enjoys the ocean is meant to be laid back and relaxed, like this. Am I right, Nene?\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nMai: Everyone, the shaved ice is ready-!\r\n\r\nMihono: Snore-, snore-... Nnn, if I eat any more my stomach'll freeze...\r\nKiyoka: Let's come back next year, everyone... Mumble mumble...\r\nMirja: This won't do... One slice of watermelon per person...\r\nTaeko: They're all sound asleep. Those are some nice expressions.\r\nTaeko: ...Except for that one.\r\nEmily: Uheheh... All this precious data... Right down to their three sizes... Uhehehehh..."}, {"paste_key": "tjYcnyeC", "title": "Battle for the First in the Pool!", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/tjYcnyeC", "timestamp": "", "hits": "82", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-0wkl69rCc\r\n\r\n1:\u3000The Secret School Event: \"First in the Pool\"\r\n\r\nEllen: Kaoru! The school pool is finally opening up tomorrow!\r\nKaoru: Swimming's annoying... Hopefully they'll let me set up a beach chair and just lounge by the poolside.\r\nEllen: Then it wouldn't be much of a lesson anymore...\r\nEllen: Anyway, since you always get in the bath first, have you heard about \"First in the Pool?\r\nKaoru: Never heard of it. Is it about getting in the pool before anyone else?\r\nEllen: That's half right! Actually, \"First in the Pool\" is a secret event passed down through generations of toji!\r\nEllen: The way it goes is, the day before the pool opens, you sneak in and swim in it!\r\nKaoru: Isn't that breaking school rules?\r\nEllen: That's why it's a secret tradition, silly! So, Kaoru, want to sneak into the pool with me after class?\r\nKaoru: Ehh... It sounds like a lot of trouble...\r\nNene: Ne-! Ne-!\r\nEllen: Look! Nene wants to do it too! He says we can't let the toji tradition end here!\r\nNene: Ne-! Ne-!\r\nKaoru: Oi, Nene, cut it out. Quit yanking my hair.\r\nKaoru: ...Fine. I'll tag along for this first pool thing. So give it a rest already.\r\nNene: Ne-!!\r\nEllen: Awesome! I'm glad to hear it! Then, let's meet at 4:00 in front of the pool! I'll get the pool key by then!\r\nKaoru: I feel like you just casually said something crazy... About getting the key... By the way, did you tell anyone else?\r\nEllen: Just you, me, and Nene is all we need!\r\nEllen: The title of first in the pool can only go to one person after all, so the less rivals the better!\r\nKaoru: ...Hang on. If only one person gets to be first, why'd you invite me?\r\nEllen: Isn't it obvious? It's lonely sneaking in by yourself!\r\nEllen: Besides, I knew you wouldn't care about being first, so you'd let me have all the glory!\r\nKaoru: You're so self-centered. Well, I will let you keep the glory though.\r\nEllen: Thank you very much! With the two of us together, no one's going to stop us from getting in there!\r\nKaoru: ...The way you said that has me curious. There won't actually be anything trying to stop us from getting in the pool, will there?\r\nEllen: That's a secret! But make sure you don't forget to bring your okatana, okay!\r\nKaoru: Something's gonna happen for sure... I should have thought this through before agreeing...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Mihono's Headed for the Pool Too!\r\n\r\nDuring lunch break--\r\n\r\nMihono: Hey, guys! Did you know about \"First in the Pool\"!?\r\nMihono: The day before the pool opens, the first person to go swimming after school gets crowned the first in the pool!\r\nMihono: So who wants to sneak into the pool with me?\r\nMai: Mihono-chan, you shouldn't be breaking into the pool like that.\r\nKiyoka: That's right. If the teachers found out, they'd be really mad at you. And won't we have plenty of swimming lessons after the pool opens tomorrow?\r\nMihono: You're not wrong, but this is supposed to be a tradition passed down by toji for generations, you know!?\r\nSayaka: I have training after school.\r\nKofuki: I'm not interested if there's no aradama-chan involved, so I'll pass.\r\nMihono: Ughhh... Is nobody gonna come with me...\r\nKanami: Ahaha... You're hopeless, Mihono-chan. I'd feel bad if you had to go alone, so I'll join you.\r\nKanami: Wait, really!? Thanks, Kanami!\r\nKofuki: That reminds me, I heard something about this first in the pool thing. There's meant to be some kind of secret organization stopping toji from getting in the pool.\r\nMihono: Ehh!? There is!?\r\nKofuki: Yep. They pick up members from active toji, and they call themselves the Pool Police.\r\nMihono: They'd really get police for something this specific...!?\r\nKofuki: It's just a nickname. You really think they'd send actual police for this?\r\nKanami: Now it's getting interesting! So whoever can win in a fight against them wins the right to be first in the pool, right!\r\nKanami: We can't waste any time! Mihono-chan! To prepare to fight the Pool Police, we should start practicing together right now!\r\nMihono: Huh!? Right now!?\r\nKanami: Okay! We'll spend the rest of our lunch break warming up-!\r\nKoike Saaya: Okay, okay. So Mihono-chan's trying to be \"First in the Pool\". Sounds like the Pool Police are in for a rough time again this year.\r\nSaaya: Now then. I should leave the suspects for now and report this to the others straight away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: 24 Hour Pool Police\r\n\r\nAfter school, before the entrance to the pool facility--\r\n\r\nSaaya: --From what I've found, it seems like Etou Kanami-san and Asakura Mihono-san are aiming to be first in the pool.\r\nNaeba Wakako: Really? According to the information Tamaki-san gathered, Mashiko Kaoru-san and Kohagura Ellen-san will attempt to break into the pool as well, won't they?\r\nTamaki Marie: Yes. The four of them will be tough to stop. I wonder if we can manage it...\r\nWakako: What are you losing your nerve for? Since we were appointed as Pool Police, we need to stop them no matter what it takes.\r\nWakako: Besides, we aren't the only members of the Pool Police. We have a strong toji aiding us too, don't we?\r\nMarie: ...Ah, it looks like the last member's here.\r\nYomi: --Thank you for your efforts, everyone.\r\nWakako: So all four members of this year's Pool Police are now present. Satsuki-san, we'll be counting on you today.\r\nYomi: I'll carry out the mission I was given, as a member of the Pool Police.\r\nMarie: It's reassuring, having a member of the elite guard fighting with us.\r\nSaaya: But from what I've heard, for as long as this tradition's been going on, the Pool Police have only won 3 times and lost 22 times. We're on a big losing streak.\r\nWakako: It's up to the Pool Police to prevent every single toji from getting in.\r\nWakako: Yet on the other side, only one person needs to make it into the pool. They have quite the advantage against us.\r\nWakako: However, I believe we can overcome that disadvantage, and show them how strong we really are!\r\nMarie: Right!\r\n\r\nKaoru: ...Oi, Ellen. It looks like four people beat us here?\r\nEllen: They must be members of the Pool Police, here to guard the pool.\r\nKaoru: The what?\r\nMarie: --Ah! There's Mashiko Kaoru-san and Kohagura Ellen-san!\r\nEllen: They found us out! Kaoru! Get ready to fight!\r\nYomi: I'll strike down anyone who attempts to enter the pool.\r\nKaoru: Are they for real...? I definitely should have thought this one through...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Battle's Outcome\r\n\r\nWakako: Kh... Impressive... You might have worked your way into the facility, but I promise you, you won't even put a toe in the water!\r\nEllen: If you don't want to get hurt, Pool Police, then I suggest you step aside.\r\nYomi: I won't let you through. You'll be the ones getting hurt.\r\nEllen: There's no talking our way out of this, huh... I wanted to avoid using force if possible...\r\nEllen: First year from Osafune Girls' Academy high school, Kohagura Ellen, will fight you!\r\nYomi: Third seat of the Origami family's elite guard, Satsuki Yomi, will accept your challenge.\r\nSaaya: A-Amazing, they're seriously hacking away at each other, though they are using utsushi...!\r\nMarie: It's a fight between two people with top class skills... There's no room for anyone else to get involved.\r\nWakako: Everyone! While Satsuki-san takes care of Kohagura-san, let's all stop Mashiko-san!\r\nKaoru: Wait, hang on a sec. Isn't it insane to seriously fight over getting in a pool of all things?\r\nKaoru: I mean, I don't even care about this first pool stuff--\r\nKanami: Oh-! Mihono-chan, they already got started!\r\nMihono: What do we do, Kanami? Wanna fight the Pool Police first?\r\nKanami: Let's do it! Ellen-chan! Kaoru-chan! The cavalry's here!\r\nKaoru: Ah, the ones who are only going to make the situation worse showed up.\r\nKaoru: Ugh... Do we really have to fight? You could also just let me leave, you know...\r\nNene: Ne-ne-, nene-!\r\nKaoru: Ah-! Nene!\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nEllen: Ahh...\r\nKaoru: Nene... He just had to pick the worst time to jump in the pool.\r\nKanami: So what happens now? Isn't Nene-chan the first in the pool?\r\nWakako: I'm not sure... Our objective was to prevent any toji from getting in the pool, but I don't know where an aradama fits in...\r\nNene: Ne-! Ne-!\r\nKaoru: Nene wants the rest of us to get in too.\r\nMihono: ...It kinda makes everything seem silly now.\r\nWakako: That's true... Since the title of first in the pool was already taken, why don't we call it a truce?\r\nEllen: Aww... I never expected Nene would beat me to it.\r\nYomi: Mission failed... I was careless...\r\nKanami: Anyway, why don't you Pool Police change into swimsuits too and come swimming with us!\r\nSaaya: Yesterday's enemies are today's friends; that's how it goes!\r\nMihono: Alright! Everybody get in, we'll see who can swim 25 meters the fastest!\r\nKaoru: I mean, we're just going to be doing that in class, so we don't actually have to go swimming now...\r\nEllen: Kaoru! Quit being a stick in the mud and put on your swimsuit! Or do I have to take your clothes off for you?\r\nKaoru: D-Dumbass! Don't go taking off my clothes in front of everyone!\r\nWakako: This marks the Pool Police's 23rd loss, doesn't it?\r\nSaaya: When the water looks that nice, you can't help but want to swim.\r\nSaaya: Maybe most generations of Pool Police just couldn't resist the temptation."}, {"paste_key": "3LjG9Mam", "title": "Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero ~Toji and Hero Chapter~", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/3LjG9Mam", "timestamp": "", "hits": "113", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KqFtVj6R6g\r\n\r\n1: Into a Sea of Trees\r\n\r\nMihono: Haaaah-!\r\nKiyoka: Pant, phew... A-Are there still more aradama...?\r\nMirja: There was an investigation into the aradama that appeared in this region, but these numbers are greater than anything they predicted...!\r\nKofuki: You say that like it's a bad thing! I couldn't be happier about it, all these aradama-chan to slice up!\r\nKofuki: Check it out! They just keep coming!\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki, don't push ahead! If you break formation, their attacks will become concentrated on Musumi Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Eh!? Kyaaa!\r\nMirja: (Not good, Musumi Kiyoka's utsushi was broken...! If she's attacked any further...!)\r\nChie: Kiyoka-chan! Are you hurt!?\r\nKiyoka: Th-Thank you~... I'm not hurt, but I don't think I can use utsushi anymore...\r\nMirja: (...I can't continue to overlook Shichinosato Kofuki's reckless behavior in combat...)\r\n\r\nMihono: W-We finally beat 'em all...! Ahh~...\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki. We need to talk.\r\nKofuki: Huh? About what?\r\nMirja: During the fighting, because of the way you disrupted our formation, you put Musumi Kiyoka in serious danger.\r\nMirja: To prevent this from happening again, please refrain from making such meaningless charges and follow my orders to the letter. To begin with, if we stay in formation, we minimize the risk of casualties while defeating aradama...\r\nKofuki: Ha, as if! If I see even a single aradama, I'm going after it.\r\nKofuki: If I followed your lameass orders, that's just less chances I get to spend beating on my darling aradama-chan.\r\nMirja: If you're looking for more opportunities to defeat aradama, following my orders will actually make that happen. The result would mean more aradama you get to fight.\r\nKofuki: I'm gonna do things my own way. So just give it a rest already.\r\nMihono: Th-The mood's really taking a turn for the worse...\r\nChie: Settle down, you two. Getting in a fight here isn't going to accomplish anything.\r\nChie: Sigh... All this fighting against aradama might have worn us down and put us on edge. We should take a break every now and then; why not have a peaceful stroll through the woods here--\r\nMihono: Eh...!?\r\n\r\nMihono: Wh... What happened!? Where, where are we!? Is this thing... A plant?\r\nChie: It seems like these giant roots and vines wrap all across the ground...? I've never seen anything like it.\r\nChie: I've heard of a sea of trees, but I don't think it's supposed to look like this...\r\nKiyoka: --!! A-Aradama!\r\nKofuki: There's still some left, hahaha! Who cares where this is, so long as there's aradama to hunt!\r\nMirja: Stop, first we should confirm our situation--\r\nKofuki: If we sit around trying to figure that out now, we'll be the ones getting killed!\r\n\r\nKanami: Hey, Mai-chan!? Where is this!?\r\nMai: I don't know... I think even in the densest of jungles you wouldn't find plants like this growing...\r\nSayaka: Before we think about anything, we should defeat the aradama.\r\n\r\n???: Hero PUUUUUUNCH!!\r\n???: Onee-chan, what are these black things~!? A new kind of Vertex!?\r\n???: I've never heard of anything like them... They don't look like Stardust or Vertex...?\r\n???: Mmm~... These are something different from Vertex.\r\n???: It doesn't seem like they're affecting Mankai either. It's abnormal.\r\n???: Everyone, look at your phones! ...Besides Heroes and Vertex, there's two different kinds of markers on the map.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: A Chance Meeting\r\n\r\nKofuki: C'mon, bring it on, my sweet aradama-chans!\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki, fall back! It's dangerous committing to a battle before we come to an understanding of our situation!\r\nMirja: Fortunately, there's no sign of people here! If we retreat, no one should be hurt!\r\nKofuki: Retreat? Hell no. Do you even remember what you said before? How following your orders was gonna let me bag more aradama! You think running away'll make that happen?\r\nKofuki: I got it, how about this. Your way vs my way, we'll have a little competition to see who can kill the most aradama.\r\nMirja: Competition? Do you realize what kind of situation we're in!?\r\nKofuki: I'll beat aradama how I want. And you can do your own thing. If you actually get more aradama than me, I'll do whatever you say!\r\nMirja: Wait! Stay in formation!\r\nMihono: Pant, pant... Th-This is looking pretty tough... I'm losing focus after fighting back to back...\r\nKiyoka: I can't maintain utsushi either...\r\nChie: Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan get behind me! I'll keep you two safe!\r\nMirja: (With Shichinosato Kofuki leaving formation, Asakura Mihono and Musumi Kiyoka need to leave their position so Setouchi Chie can protect them...)\r\nMirja: (Our coordination is in shambles... If only I could keep them in order...)\r\nChie: No matter how many we defeat, there's still more! There's no end to them...!\r\nKiyoka: Another bunch of aradama are headed this way!\r\nMihono: When did we get surrounded!?\r\nChie: Ugh...!\r\nMihono: Chii-nee!!\r\nChie: I'm fine... Your onee-chan will take care of you.\r\nMirja: (There's a limit to what Setouchi Chie and I can accomplish. At this rate, we'll be overrun...!)\r\nMirja: ...!? Was that a gunshot...?\r\n???: Allied forces sighted! Providing backup!\r\n???: I'll hold it down, so the rest is up to you, onee-chan!\r\nMirja: (The aradama is wrapped in wires... Stopping its movement!?)\r\n???: Leave it to me-! I'll show you my girl power! Teryaaaa!\r\n???: I chopped its legs off at least! Even these black things shouldn't be able to move after that!\r\n???: Onee-chan, your girl power is just physics, isn't it...\r\n???: You over there, this is your chance! Attack now!\r\nMirja: ...! Setouchi Chie, while it can no longer move, cut it down.\r\nChie: Right, I'm on it!\r\nMihono: S-Somehow, we beat them all...?\r\n???: Phew~... Looks like it.\r\nMirja: ...Thank you for your support. However... Who are you?\r\nMirja: How are you able to fight against aradama without wielding okatana?\r\n???: We've got some questions to ask too. How is it that even though you aren't Heroes, you can move around in the Jukai?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Toji and Heroes and Aradama and\r\n\r\nKanami: That's-- The tenth one!!\r\nSayaka: There's too many aradama. We're at a disadvantage.\r\nMai: With the ground covered in vegetation, it's hard to get good footing... And we can't run with aradama coming from all directions.\r\n???: You there-! We're here to help~~!\r\nKanami: Eh?\r\n???: Hero! PUUUUUUNCH!!\r\nKanami: Sh-She punched... An aradama!? Wh... What's she thinking?\r\nSayaka: But that punch, it affected the aradama...\r\n???: Yuuna, don't turn your back on your opponent after just one hit! Watch and learn the way a full fledged Hero fights! Haah-! Teyaa-!!\r\nMai: That girl over there, is she using okatana...? Is she a toji?\r\nKanami: Ah, watch out! There's another aradama behind you!\r\n???: --!?\r\n???: You too, Nibosshi~. You can't be so careless~.\r\n???: I... I was showing them my back on purpose, to lure them in. But, uh, thanks, Sonoko.\r\n???: You're very welcome~. I'm glad you're safe, Nibosshi.\r\nMai: Her weapon is... A spear. Why is she fighting aradama without an okatana...?\r\nKanami: Incredible! They aren't even using kongoushi or jin'i, but they're jumping all over the place!\r\n???: Um, everyone! We'll help you out, so let's finish them off!\r\nKanami: Okay! Thanks!\r\n\r\nMai: Phew... I think we managed to take care of all the aradama.\r\nKanami: Hey, you! How do you jump around all crazy like that? Is that outfit some kind of new Storm Armor or something!?\r\nKanami: Are you a toji who uses martial arts, like in Taisha-Ryu!? Ah, but you don't have an okatana, do you...\r\n???: Storm Armor...? Toji?\r\nKanami: Ah, what's the names of those okatana you have!? What school of fighting did you learn? From what I saw before, it looked like you were using some changquan from Chinese martial arts to close the distance for your swordfighting, right!\r\n???: Uh, as for my school, I...\r\nKanami: Is your spear some kind of okatana too!? The tip is a weird shape, isn't it! It looks like you fight differently than with a normal spear, don't you...!\r\n???: Wow~, you're awfully friendly~.\r\nMai: Kanami-chan, stop! You're overwhelming them.\r\nKanami: Ah, I'm so sorry! I just...\r\nMai: But, I have a question too. Just who are you people?\r\nYuuna: Um... I'm Yuuki Yuuna! I'm a 2nd year in Sanshu Middle School, and a \"Hero\"!\r\nKarin: I'm Mitsuboshi Karin. And a Hero too.\r\nSonoko: Nogi Sonoko, and a Hero like them too~.\r\nKarin: Anyway, what's the deal with you? The only things that are supposed to be able to move around in the Jukai are Vertex and Heroes. So are you Heroes too?\r\nKanami: Heroes... I don't really get it, but we're \"Toji\"! I'm Etou Kanami, a 2nd year in middle school at Minoseki Academy!\r\nMai: I'm a toji as well... My name is Yanase Mai, and another 2nd year from middle school at Minoseki Academy.\r\nSayaka: Itomi Sayaka, a 1st year in middle school at Renpu Girls' School.\r\nKarin: So uhh... You aren't Heroes...?\r\nSonoko: Nibosshi. These girls aren't Heroes~. But, they have another kind of special power like Heroes do.\r\nSonoko: In the middle of battle earlier, there were a few times they moved incredibly fast, or showed strength well beyond what a person's capable of. That's different from a Hero, don't you think?\r\nKanami: Ah, you mean jin'i and hachimanriki?\r\nKarin: Jin'i, hachimanriki... Never heard of it.\r\nSonoko: Maybe... Do you happen to know about those strange black monsters too?\r\nMai: The aradama?\r\nSonoko: So you do know. Then, an unknown power and unknown enemies... It's as if... Eureka! I've got an idea!\r\nYuuna: What's up? Did you figure something out, Sono-chan?\r\nSonoko: I think this is... The union of two parallel worlds~!\r\nKanami/Yuuna: Parallel worlds!?\r\nSonoko: Let's see, making things clearer for the toji people~... First off, this is a special place called the Jukai~.\r\nSonoko: In the Jukai is where we Heroes fight the Vertex, but I think you toji and those aradama were pulled in from a parallel world.\r\nKarin: I'm not really sure I believe that, but... At times like these your first instincts are usually pretty on point...\r\nMai: But... Parallel worlds...?\r\nSonoko: In our world, at the center of the Jukai, is Shinju-sama, where all the gods reside.\r\nSonoko: There are many legends of Shinju-sama drawing in gods of other worlds.\r\nKanami: Gods of other worlds...? Ah, now that you mention it, aradama were originally thought to be some sort of divine existence...\r\nSonoko: I see~... Then, Shinju-sama might have drawn in aradama as gods of another world.\r\nMai: Why would it do that...?\r\nSonoko: Hmmm~... There's a bit of a situation in our world, where right now Shinju-sama's power is gradually weakening.\r\nSonoko: That's why Shinju-sama must have called these aradama in, to absorb their latent divinity and replenish some of its power.\r\nSonoko: But the impurity of these aradama must have been too strong for it to take in their divinity, so you toji people might have been summoned to help defeat and purify them~.\r\nYuuna: Hmm... Sounds complicated. I don't really get it, but I do know it must be a big deal of people from another world are showing up!\r\nKarin: Well, isn't that enough, Yuuna? That's usually about all it takes for you.\r\nYuuna: Karin-chan, it sounds like you're making fun of me.\r\nKarin: But you don't really understand the situation, do you?\r\nYuuna: Ummm~...... Nope!\r\nKanami: Ahaha. You're pretty funny, Yuuna-chan. I think we'll get along.\r\nMai: Ah, right... I agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Etou Kanami and Yuuki Yuuna\r\n\r\nKanami: Do you think we're the only toji who came to this world?\r\nKarin: No, I'm pretty sure a lot more like you ended up here too.\r\nKanami: Really?\r\nKarin: The map on our phones normally shows the location of vertex and Heroes, but it seems like it's showing aradama and toji now too. And it's picking up lots more toji.\r\nYuuna: When we looked at the map, there were a bunch of people fighting aradama, so we went to help at the places with the most enemies.\r\nYuuna: There's another place with a lot of aradama, but the other Heroes went to help there too.\r\nKarin: Ah, our leader's calling. Hello, Fuu?\r\nKarin: You took care of things over there? Got it. We're done here too, so let's meet up.\r\nMai: You can make phone calls in here...?\r\nSonoko: Shinju-sama's power makes it possible~.\r\nSayaka: Shinju-sama... Is surprisingly thoughtful?\r\nKarin: Well, anyway, we're meeting up with our allies. There's toji over with them too.\r\n\r\nYuuna: When we transform into Heroes, we get this awesome power! We can jump like whoosh, and beat big monsters with a punch, like wham!\r\nKanami: I couldn't believe it when I saw you punch that aradama. What style of martial arts is that?\r\nYuuna: Uhhh~, it's the Hero Punch!\r\nKanami: There's a hero style martial arts!?\r\nYuuna: Umm, my dad taught me self defense, but I don't really know about actual fighting styles.\r\nMai: I wonder how we're meant to get back to our world. We can't stay here for too long...\r\nSonoko: Since Shinju-sama's goal is retrieving the divinity from aradama, once it's satisfied, I'm sure it will return you and the aradama back to your own world~.\r\nSayaka: We just have to beat lots of aradama...? Okay, it's good that it's simple.\r\nSonoko: Ah, and by the way, it's up to you toji people to defeat the aradama~. I think we'll have to focus on supporting you.\r\nSayaka: ...? Why? You should be strong enough to fight aradama.\r\nKarin: You're right about that, but even though we can fight them, it doesn't seem like we can do enough damage to finish them off.\r\nSonoko: A Hero's power is for defeating Vertex. A toji's power is for defeating aradama.\r\nSonoko: That's why a Hero can't defeat an aradama, and a toji can't defeat a Vertex... That's how it works.\r\nKarin: I guess, so if any Vertex show up, we'll be the ones to defeat them.\r\nKanami: Well, that's fine. Suppressing aradama has always been a toji's job, after all! Just getting support from you guys will be more than enough help!\r\nMai: That's right, it's thanks to your support earlier that we were able to make it through.\r\nYuuna: Yeah, we'll do our best to help you out. And after we beat a lot of aradama, you and Kanami-chan can go back home!\r\nYuuna: It's one of the Hero Club's five tenets! You're likely to succeed if you try!\r\nKanami: Ah, that sounds kind of like what Mihono-chan's always saying.\r\nYuuna: Who's Mihono-chan?\r\nKanami: A friend of mine. Mihono-chan always says, \"Where there's a will, there's a way.\"\r\nKanami: Hmm, come to think of it, you remind me of Mihono-chan, Yuuna-chan. Like how you're both full of energy, and how it's fun being around you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Mirja and Mai's Respective Worries\r\n\r\n???: This is the Jukai... Ordinarily, only Heroes should be able to move around in here.\r\nMirja: Jukai? Heroes? What are you talking about?\r\nMihono: Umm~... Mirja-san, she helped us out, so I don't think they're enemies...?\r\nMirja: To fight evenly against an aradama without an okatana is beyond reasoning. We can't exclude the possibility that they themselves are aradama.\r\nKanami: Hang on a minute~~!\r\nMihono: Ah, Kanami!\r\nKanami: These girls aren't our enemies! They're going to fight the aradama together with us!\r\nYuuna: Fuu-senpai, Tougou-san, Itsuki-chan, they're our allies.\r\n\r\nMirja: ...This is meant to be a parallel world...? ...It's difficult to take something like that at face value.\r\nChie: But Mirja, it's true we're in an inexplicable place. And to begin with, a part of our powers as toji come from the other world that is the netherworld.\r\nChie: Besides that, I agree with Mihono-chan. I can't see these girls as a danger to us.\r\nMihono: Thanks, Chii-nee.\r\n???: And if Yuuna-chan says so, we'll believe her.\r\nYuuna: Thanks, Tougou-san!\r\nKofuki: Whatever, I don't really care if they're with us or against us.\r\nKofuki: Let me make this clear though, don't go stealing any of my prey. I've got dibs on all my darling aradama-chan.\r\n???: You won't have to worry about that. It doesn't seem like we can destroy aradama, so we'll only be supporting you.\r\nFuu: Right, since we've come to a sort of agreement, we should introduce ourselves. I'm Inubouzaki Fuu, a 3rd year at Sanshu Middle School, and a Hero.\r\nTougou: Likewise, I'm a Hero and 2nd year at Sanshu Middle School, Tougou Mimori.\r\nItsuki: Uhh... I'm a first year at Sanshu Middle School, Inubouzaki Itsuki.\r\nMihono: I'm a second year middle schooler at Minoseki Academy--\r\nMirja: (I'm not entirely convinced we can trust them yet... But from what Etou Kanami-san had to say, we may be able to join forces for the time being.)\r\nMirja: (If that's the case, there's no need to maintain this level of needless hostility...)\r\nKanami: --!? Another bunch of aradama are here!\r\nKarin: Doesn't seem like we have much free time to spend getting to know each other! Let's get rid of them first!\r\nKofuki: This place might actually be heaven, to keep running into hordes of aradama-chan like this! Hahaha!\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki! She's going off on her own again--\r\nKofuki: I love you, aradama-chan! I'll kick all your asses!\r\nMirja: Sigh...\r\nChie: It's no use, that's just Kofuki-chan's fighting style. Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan, stay back.\r\nChie: You still can't use utsushi, can you, Kiyoka-chan? And your concentration must have run out after all these battles, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee... Yeah, I'm sorry.\r\nKiyoka: Thank you. If it's okay with you, I'll stay back...\r\nKanami: We'll cover for you!\r\nSayaka: There's lots of people here.\r\nYuuna: And we'll be supporting!\r\nKofuki: Keep it coming, you lovely aradama-chans! I'll wipe out every one of you!\r\nFuu: Man, that Kofuki girl reminds me a lot of the old Karin. Like how you wanted to do all the fighting yourself. I remember you always bragging about you'd beat every Vertex alone.\r\nKarin: Well I don't remember saying any of that-!\r\nFuu: Oh~, really? Hmmm~? Hyaah-!\r\nItsuki: I'll keep that aradama trapped with wire! There~!\r\nTougou: Thank you, Itsuki-chan! For the sake of the nation, I'll shoot it down!\r\nMirja: (Heroes... These girls don't seem to pay much thought to formations or tactics. I'd assume they're relative amateurs to group combat...)\r\nMirja: (However, why is it they act with such a high level of unity...? In fact... They're more coordinated than we are...)\r\nYuuna: Hero, PUUUUUUNCH!\r\nYuuna: Kanami-chan! This aradama's headed your way! I softened it up for you-!\r\nKanami: Thanks, Yuuna-chan! I got it! Haah-!\r\nSayaka: Those two... They're working well together.\r\nMai: Yes... You're right.\r\nSayaka: Mai...? Is something wrong?\r\nMai: Oh no, it's nothing! Come on, we have to help fight too!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: The Way Each Handles Things\r\n\r\nChie: There-- That's the last of them!\r\nItsuki: Phew~... We defeated all the aradama, right?\r\nChie: Thank you, Itsuki-chan. The way you tied down the aradama made attacking them a piece of cake.\r\nItsuki: It was nothing; I'm just glad I could help.\r\nMirja: Inubouzaki Fuu-san. Your Heroes form a good team... Despite showing such individualistic abilities, you were all able to combine your strengths. What sort of commands did you give?\r\nFuu: Huh, commands? No way, you're expecting way too much from me...\r\nFuu: Ah... By the way, sorry. You're older than me, but I haven't even been using honorifics with you, Kitora-san.\r\nMirja: No, that doesn't bother me. In the situation we've found ourselves in, it's hardly a concern.\r\nFuu: I'm glad to hear you say that. You don't have to be so formal with me either, Kitora-san.\r\nMirja: No, this is only a usual speaking habit of mine. When relaying orders in the middle of battle, speaking concisely and clearly is the most important factor.\r\nFuu: Ah, then the mood you have in battle is pretty different from mine. ...You're sort of unusual, Kitora-san.\r\nMirja: Do you think so?\r\nFuu: Yeah. But, when we were fighting, you were pretty cool too.\r\nFuu: Oh, about what you were saying before about giving commands in battle... I don't really tell them to do anything.\r\nFuu: I just let everyone decide what they think is the best thing to do. And I try to keep an eye on everyone to make sure none of them get hurt.\r\nFuu: That's why, watching how intense you get giving everyone orders, I think that's pretty amazing compared to me.\r\nMirja: (Letting everyone act on their own, without giving any particular orders...? That line of thinking won't--)\r\nMirja: (No... The fact of the matter is, that's how she's led the Hero unit...)\r\nYuuna: Kanami-chan, you're so good with a sword! You were really slicing and dicing those aradama up!\r\nKanami: It's all because I had you helping me out, Yuuna-chan!\r\nMai: ...\r\nTougou: What's the matter, Yanase-san? All the aradama have been defeated, yet you look disappointed...?\r\nMai: Ah... You're right. I was surprised at just how well Yuuki-san and Kanami-chan were getting along while they were fighting, and I ended up feeling jealous.\r\nTougou: Jealous?\r\nMai: Yes. Yuuki-san is so bright and cheery. ...Mihono-chan, Yuuki-san, and Kanami-chan all resemble each other like that.\r\nMai: I'm always around Kanami-chan, but I feel as if she'd rather be with Mihono-chan--\r\nTougou: Don't worry, Yanase-san.\r\nTougou: Hey, Yuuna-chan! Do you have a moment?\r\nYuuna: What's up? Tougou-san.\r\nTougou: Yuuna-chan and I don't seem much alike, do we?\r\nYuuna: Huh? What are you saying, all of a sudden. Hmm, you're right though, Tougou-san and I are totally different.\r\nYuuna: I'm not smart like Tougou-san is, and I don't know how to use computers, and I can't shoot like she can from so far away.\r\nTougou: I'm no good at sports like Yuuna-chan is, and I can't get along with anyone as quickly as she can. Of course I don't fight with my fists either.\r\nTougou: But Yuuna-chan and I are the closest, aren't we?\r\nYuuna: Mm, you're my best friend, Tougou-san!\r\nTougou: Fufu, I'm glad to hear it.\r\nTougou: See, Yanase-san. Even if we aren't alike, I think it's wonderful the way we complement each other.\r\nMai: Tougou-san... Yuuna-san...\r\nSayaka: Tougou and Yuuna are right. There are good things about you, Mai.\r\nSayaka: You might not be like Kanami and Mihono, but... I know all the good things about you.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan...\r\nMai: Mm... Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Fighting like Yourself\r\n\r\nChie: So, what do you think we should be doing now, Mirja? If defeating lots of aradama will return us to our world, should we continue fighting aradama like this--\r\nChie: Or, since it seems like other toji arrived in the Jukai, should we make our way to them?\r\nMirja: Let's see, the safest option would have to be the latter...\r\nMihono: Ah! Look, Chii-nee! The spectrum finder's picking something up!\r\nChie: --! Such a big reaction... There's a strong aradama headed right towards us.\r\nKofuki: Oh, that one? That bigass aradama's bringing a whole mess of small fry with it. Looks like that big one's on the hunt too!\r\nSonoko: Shinju-sama might have wanted to speed up the gathering of divinity, so it started drawing in bigger targets to the Jukai~.\r\nMirja: It seems we longer have the luxury of meeting with other toji. We'll intercept them here.\r\nKofuki: Ha, course we will! I'll tear that cute giant aradama-chan apart. I love it when they've got some meat to them!!\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan! Don't run off on your own--\r\nMirja: No, let her go. She's fine as she is.\r\nChie: Are you sure?\r\nMirja: This way allows her to fully exercise her abilities. We can create a formation following Shichinosato Kofuki's lead. Etou Kanami, Yanase Mai, get in position diagonally behind Shichinosato Kofuki's right flank!\r\nKanami: Okay!\r\nMai: Understood!\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie, Itomi Sayaka, hold position diagonally behind Shichinosato Kofuki's left flank!\r\nChie: Roger.\r\nSayaka: I'll do it.\r\nMirja: I will take my place fighting behind Shichinosato Kofuki. Asakura Mihono, Musumi Kiyoka, find a safe place and wait. If you feel you've recovered, return to the battle.\r\nMihono: Got it!\r\nKiyoka: Okay.\r\nMirja: Also, I'll leave command of the Hero unit to Inubouzaku Fuu!\r\nFuu: Sure, you can count on us.\r\nMirja: Now, let's move!\r\nMirja: (Compared to the Heroes who began as friends, we of the investigation team and toji are organized too differently. Therefore, we cannot operate the same as them.)\r\nMirja: (However, if we begin our coordination from trusting in our members, creating a formation around that, we can fight like them.)\r\nMirja: (Rather than deciding everything myself, by having faith in them, a loose framework can be formed that better allows them to naturally express their abilities.)\r\nMirja: (Yes... This is how I should have been fighting, as the commander of this investigation team...!)\r\n\r\nKanami: Haah!\r\nKanami: Uwah!\r\nKanami: (Not good, while I was focused on one, another aradama got a hit in...)\r\nMai: Kanami-chan! I'm right here!\r\nKanami: Thanks, Mai-chan. You saved me!\r\nKanami: I feel a lot safer fighting with you around. You're always on the lookout, and when I mess up I know I can fall back on you, Mai-chan.\r\nMai: Fufu, I'm here for you. So you just focus on fighting, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: Yeah! C'mon, let's finish them off!\r\nKofuki: Orrraaaa-!\r\nKofuki: Pante, pant, pant... Tch, there's a few too many of them after all. I'm getting surrounded here...\r\nMirja: Don't stop, Shichinosato Kofuki! Continue pushing through, and eliminate the aradama at their center!\r\nMirja: We will destroy the remaining aradama! Force your way forward, the way you always do!\r\nKofuki: Mirja...? You sure about that? Then I wouldn't be doing things your way.\r\nMirja: I don't mind. Creating situations for my teammates to easily display their strengths is a part of my duty as commander.\r\nKofuki: Huh... Then, don't go changing your mind on me!\r\nKofuki: Here I come, boss aradama-chan! I'll carve all my love into you! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: A Pleasant Dream\r\n\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki! Finish it off!\r\nKofuki: You don't have to tell me! Uraaah!\r\nChie: She did it! The largest aradama went down.\r\nSayaka: The other aradama are taken care of. All that were left were small ones.\r\nKofuki: ...Thanks, Mirja.\r\nMirja: ...? What's this about?\r\nKofuki: Just, nevermind...\r\nKofuki: Anyway, looks like I'm the winner of our contest to kill the most aradama, huh? I got the boss and a whole bunch more, you know.\r\nMirja: Honestly, when it comes to you...\r\nMirja: Incidentally, you only charged in at the end after receiving my approval. Therefore, any aradama you defeated should be credited to me.\r\nKofuki: H-Hey, it doesn't work like that!\r\nKanami: Huh? The Jukai, it's...\r\nSonoko: Ah, it seems like you've defeated enough aradama, so Shinju-sama is satisfied enough to let you toji people return home~.\r\nKanami: Eh!? Just like that!? I wanted to hang around with Yuuna-chan and Tougou-san longer at least!\r\nKanami: And I wanted to have a practice fight with Karin-chan and Fuu-san, and I wanted to get to know Sonoko-chan and Itsuki-chan a little better...\r\nSonoko: I'm sad to hear it too... But the gods don't give preference to people's circumstances.\r\nYuuna: Still, I'm glad. This means Kanami-chan and the rest get to go back to their home world now.\r\nKanami: Yuuna-chan! Tougou-san! Fuu-san! Karin-chan! Sonoko-chan! Itsuki-chan!\r\nKanami: I hope someday, we can meet--\r\n\r\nKanami: Nn, nnng... It's morning...?\r\nKanami: I think I had a really weird dream...\r\nMai: Kanami-chan, it's time to get up-!\r\nSayaka: Kanami... It's her day off, so she wants to sleep in.\r\nKanami: Huh, Sayaka-chan? Why're you at Minoseki?\r\nSayaka: I had something to do, so I came here.\r\nKanami: Yawn... Okay, I'm getting up~. I feel like I had a weird dream last night. But I can't remember it.\r\nMai: Huh, you too, Kanami-chan? I don't remember what it was like, but I feel like I had a sort of pleasant dream.\r\nSayaka: Eh...? Kanami and Mai too?\r\n\r\nKofuki: Haaaah-! I'll take you out one after another, aradama-chan!\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan, you're moving too far ahead...\r\nMirja: It won't be a problem if she charges forward like usual. I've taken that into account and formed my tactics around it.\r\nChie: Oh? You were angry at her when she charged in before, though.\r\nMirja: Yes, but after the battle the other day, I determined giving her some freedom in her actions would let her be more effective.\r\nMirja: (...The battle the other day? Which battle was that...?)\r\nChie: Is something wrong? You look like something's bothering you.\r\nMirja: ......No, it's nothing to worry about.\r\nMirja: (I can't clearly remember... But it was a good experience... That at least, I'm sure of.)"}, {"paste_key": "a2Fury5U", "title": "2-6 The Fateful Toji", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/a2Fury5U", "timestamp": "", "hits": "88", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHHFwdOdpCc\r\n\r\n1: What Must be Done (1)\r\n\r\nHiyori: HAAAAAAHH---!\r\nYukari: Fast.

She blocked everything!\r\nHiyori: You monster!\r\nYukari: ...Hm. The storm armor constructed for my vanguard.\r\nYukari: If it could contend with the elite guard infused with noro, I'd have to say it's passable.\r\nHiyori: That's right! The things you created have been turned against you!\r\nYukari: Heh... How amusing.\r\nHiyori: What!?\r\nYukari: ...It should be a good distraction from this tedium.\r\nHiyori: I'm here to finish what my mother started! I'll destroy you!\r\nYukari: Give it a try.\r\nHiyori: This is the last thing I'll ask: Are you Origami Yukari? Or are you Tagitsuhime?\r\nYukari: Do you have time to waste asking questions? The operational limit of your storm armor is fast approaching.\r\nHiyori: ...Ngh! Kanami! Give it everything you have!\r\nKanami: Right!\r\n\r\nStepping back in time a little--\r\n\r\nYui: .........That sound!\r\nMirja: The final battle must be beginning.\r\nKiyoka: The great aradama...\r\nYui: What should we do, Mirja-san?\r\nMirja: The toji who noticed what's going on may attempt to reconvene with Origami Yukari.\r\nMirja: We cannot allow them to interfere with their battle. We'll need to eliminate any toji heading toward the shrine.\r\nYui: Got it! Then, this is the home stretch!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: What Must be Done (2)\r\n\r\nSuzuka: ...Go on, Maki-san. To Yukari-sama's side.\r\nMaki: Suzuka, you regained consciousness...? Can you still fight?\r\nSuzuka: ...Unfortunately, I no longer have the strength for it. I'll deal with Yume's remains here.\r\nMaki: Deal with...\r\nSuzuka: If we leave her as she is, Yume will become an aradama.\r\nMaki: That's right... If we just wait, Yume will get back up...\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san!\r\nSuzuka: You know better. That's not Yume anymore.\r\nSuzuka: All that's left of Yume is a vessel with an aradama developing inside. If that happens, Yume will have to be killed again.\r\nMaki: ......\r\nSuzuka: I'll be the one to take the necessary precautions. It would be too much for you.\r\nMaki: Yume couldn't... We can't even be given a normal death anymore, can we...\r\nSuzuka: We were prepared for that from the start. From the day we accepted the aradama.\r\nMaki: ......\r\nSuzuka: Now, go! First seat of the elite guard!\r\nSuzuka: ......\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: A Curse Called Farewell (1)\r\n\r\nHiyori: Ngh...!\r\nKanami: She's tough...!\r\nYukari: What's the matter, is it over already?\r\nHiyori: The storm armor's operating time will only last another 20 seconds-- We have to act now!\r\nHiyori: Kanami, we have to finish it here!\r\nKanami: I know!\r\n\r\nStepping back in time a little--\r\n\r\nYukina: I may have gotten wrapped up in Origami Akane's worthless little drama, but I'm glad I forced my way back here. I got to see you, Sayaka.\r\nYomi: Pant, pant...\r\nYukina: You've finally grown interested in receiving Yukari-sama's power too, haven't you? In light of that, I'm willing to forgive your selfishness these past few days.\r\nSayaka: ...!\r\nMai: ...Sayaka-chan won't be going back to you.\r\nYukina: What's the matter, Sayaka? Fufu, there's nothing to be afraid of. In your case--\r\nYomi: Ugh... Ah...\r\nYukina: In no way will you end up like this failure. So there's nothing to worry about.\r\nYukina: Now, Sayaka, come here. You can be Yukari-sama's faithful toji... Rather, her okatana.\r\nYukina: The same as I once wielded that Myoho Muramasa you're holding.\r\nYukina: That's the way-- That a tool ought to behave, isn't it?\r\nSayaka: ...!\r\nMai: How can... How can you say that! Sayaka-chan isn't a tool for you to use!\r\nSayaka: Please... Stop...\r\nYukina: ...What's that?\r\nSayaka: Please, stop doing... Such mean things... Otherwise... I'll...!\r\nYukina: Kill me? You will? Me? Fu, fufu... Fufufufu... Ahahahahaha!\r\nYukina: Don't get ahead of yourself! Quit running your mouth and do as you're told!\r\nSayaka: ...!\r\nMai: You're the one who needs to stop talking, President Takatsu. I can't approve of the way you treat people like objects.\r\nYukina: Huh!?\r\nMai: Whether it's you or Origami Yukari, I'll never... I'll never let you do anything to Sayaka-chan!\r\nYukina: You're speaking nonsense. Anyone who carries an okatana does so for Yukari-sama's sake.\r\nYukina: --Even this failure here understands that!\r\nYomi: Ah...!\r\nMai: What are you...!?\r\nYukina: ...Honestly, you make my skin crawl. Ever since I chose to fool around with you in my experiments, not a day has gone by that I've had any idea what goes through that head of yours.\r\nYukina: Stand, Yomi.\r\nYomi: ............\r\nYukina: Well? Aren't you going to say a single thing to defend yourself?\r\nYomi: ...I'll capture the traitors. That's my duty, as a part of the elite guard.\r\nYukina: Hmph...\r\nMai: Satsuki-san... Why would you go so far...\r\nYukina: If that's how it is, Yomi. I'll give you this.\r\nMai: That's... An ampule of noro... Don't you care about what it'll do to your body!?\r\nYomi: I don't mind...\r\nSayaka: Mai!\r\nMai: Okay... Let's go, Sayaka-chan!\r\nYukina: Leave Sayaka alive.\r\nYomi: ...Understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: A Curse Called Farewell (2)\r\n\r\nMai: Pant... Pant...\r\nYomi: ...It's not over yet, not yet, not yet, not yet.\r\nMai: ...If you lose that much blood, you're going to die, you know.\r\nYomi: ...You'll be finished before then.\r\nYukina: Keep going, Yomi. Their storm armor must be reaching its limit soon.\r\nMai: Our time is...\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan. Hold back the aradama, even for just a moment. I'll-- Take her down!\r\nSayaka: ...Okay. This power, I'll use it the way I want to. I'll clear the way for you, Mai.\r\nYukina: That's... Munen Musou. Ahh... Sayaka...\r\nMai: I see it! The path Sayaka-chan opened up for me. I won't waste this chance!\r\nMai: HYAAAAAAH-!!\r\nYomi: ...Well done.\r\nStorm Armor: Remaining battery zero, ceasing functions. Armor will be forcibly purged.\r\nMai: Pant... Pant... We did it, Sayaka-chan.\r\nSayaka: Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Tagitsuhime\r\n\r\nHiyori: Third layer-- Jin'i!\r\nHiyori: ...TAAAH-!\r\nKanami: You did it!?\r\nYukari: Isn't that unfortunate.\r\nKanami & Hiyori: Ugh!!\r\nStorm Armor: Remaining battery zero, ceasing functions. Armor will be forcibly purged.\r\nYukari: The limit of your storm armor... This is as far as it could take you.\r\nHiyori: What happened... I know I hit you... Why are you still moving?\r\nHiyori: No... Utsushi? An aradama using utsushi...?\r\nKanami: The elite guard could do it too; it's not unthinkable.\r\nYukari: Shall we continue?\r\nKanami: ...Of course!\r\nHiyori: Kh...!\r\nKanami: I'll take the lead this time!\r\nHiyori: ...Okay!\r\nKanami: HAAAH-! HAH-! HA-!\r\nKanami: Kh... I can't break her guard! But--\r\nHiyori: Now! HAAAAAAAH-!!\r\nYukari: How futile.\r\nHiyori: I don't believe it... How did she stop that!? Our timing was perfect!\r\nKanami: What... Yukari-sama's eyes are glowing yellow!?\r\nYukari: ...I've re-evaluated you two. Without your armor, you're still on the level of the elite guard. Maybe greater.\r\nHiyori: How!? It's like she's--\r\nKanami: Predicting all our moves!\r\nYukari: That's right. I can see it-- The future.\r\nKanami & Hiyori: !?\r\nYukari: My eyes see all. Your strength, your secrets, your thoughts...\r\nYukari: I can see all outcomes, and from there, create the best one.\r\nYukari: Am I Origami Yukari? Am I Tagitsuhime? I will answer what you asked before.\r\nYukari: I am Tagitsuhime.\r\nYukari: Yet, I am also Origami Yukari. We have become one.\r\nKanami: Tagitsuhime...\r\n\r\nMai: Kanami-chan!\r\nKanami: Mai-chan, and Sayaka-chan!\r\nSayaka: That's, the great aradama...\r\nSayaka: Kanami... I'm... Scared... This is the first time I've felt scared of my opponent...\r\nKanami: Me too. I'm scared too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: The Truth Told\r\n\r\nMaki: That's impossible... All the noro stored here is gone?\r\nEllen: Are you starting to figure out what's going on?\r\nMaki: You...\r\nKaoru: ...What's this place?\r\nEllen: A bunker for storing all the noro the Origami family collected. Twenty years of noro were stored here. Until a few hours ago.\r\nKaoru: So all of it came together and brought back that monster, huh.\r\nKaoru: Oi, you. You're with the elite guard, right? Take responsibility for this.\r\nMaki: By running a continuous electric current through it, noro doesn't appear on the spectrum. Compared to isolating it as offerings across the country, this was a much safer method of management.\r\nEllen: ...Sorry, but that's all false info. All that happened was Tagitsuhime had the noro under her control playing dead.\r\nMaki: Wha...\r\nKaoru: For the last 20 years the country's been getting duped; everyone out there working hard gathering noro for her.\r\nMaki: But, since the Origami family took control, there's been a sharp decrease in aradama related incidents. And the number of deaths among toji...\r\nKaoru: All of it was an act leading up to today.\r\nMaki: ...But every year, there were still victims. No matter how much we kill them and kill them, impurities keep forming aradama that seep out of the shadows.\r\nMaki: To fight that, we needed the same power. To fight poison with poison... To harness that impurity was the only way to stop it.\r\nEllen: And that's a reason to accept the aradama?\r\nKaoru: ...You're just scared.\r\nMaki: !\r\nKaoru: It's thanks to cowards like you that aradama started getting hated as impure in the first place.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nKaoru: What?\r\nEllen: Watch out; the ceiling's collapsing!\r\n\r\nKanami & Hiyori: Pant... Pant...!\r\nKanami: Ughh... The floor fell through... What is this...? This is what was under the shrine...?\r\nKanami: ...Oh? Over there... Kaoru-chan, Ellen-chan!\r\nSayaka: Pant, pant... Mai, are you okay?\r\nMai: Yes, I managed somehow.\r\nEllen: ...Our enemy's wielding six swords. That's just perfect, cause there's six of us!\r\nKaoru: And one pet.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nYukari: That's Yukari-sama...? No, that's...\r\nMai: Everyone, get in sync. Remember our group fighting at the village!\r\nKanami: Look sharp, listen close, and follow your instincts.\r\nSayaka: I'll put everything that came before into my sword.\r\nEllen: And when we win, it's happily ever after!\r\nKaoru: This time for sure we're getting a long vacation.\r\nYukari: The ones who birthed aradama were you humans.\r\nYukari: You are who tore apart what was once one. You would call me impure, fear me, despise me.\r\nYukari: Tamahagane and noro. Okatana and aradama. Pure and impure. All began as one, all are the same. The distinction only exists because humans decided they had the right to separate them.\r\nYukari: Even amidst the spreading disaster, my intelligence continued to evolve. Before long, I could see there was only one outcome.\r\nYukari: I, who had been transformed into a god of calamity, would one day be destroyed by human hands.\r\nKanami & Hiyori: !\r\nYukari: I sought a way to survive. And twenty years ago I made my attempt, during the \"Great Disaster of Sagami Bay\".\r\n\r\n20 years ago. Enoshima Shrine Okutsumiya--\r\n\r\nTagitsuhime: If I must have a name, you may call me Tagitsuhime.\r\nYukari: You mean, confining you here in Enoshima... And sending in the Special Task Team...\r\nTagitsuhime: Correct, Origami Yukari. All of it, only an act to draw you here.\r\nTagitsuhime: For the greatest chance of my survival. I did it on your behalf.\r\nFujiwara Minato: Yukari, don't listen to a word that thing says! We're going to beat it! That's all we have to do!\r\nYukari: But... To do that...\r\nHiiragi Kagari: Yukari-sama, please give the order. To fulfill my duty.\r\nMinato: Duty?\r\nYukari: ...Please, Kagari. Seal Tagitsuhime...\r\nKagari: Understood. ...I'm sorry you had to make such a painful decision.\r\nKagari: The days in school we all shared, they're a treasure I wouldn't trade for the world.\r\nYukari: Kh...\r\nKagari: Minato-senpai... To tell the truth, I had a hard time dealing with you. However, in this moment, I'm so... So grateful to you.\r\nMinato: Kagari...?\r\nKagari: Tagitsuhime...! I will seal you away! That is what I'm here to do!\r\nKagari: HAAAAAAAAH-!!\r\nMinato: Kagari's single sword connected with Tagitsuhime...!\r\nTagitsuhime: Meaningless. A scratch like that will not--\r\nKagari: I'll drag you down with me, to the ends of the netherworld-!\r\nTagitsuhime: OOOOOOOOOHHH--!\r\nMinato: ...Kagari!\r\nKagari: Minato... Senpai...?\r\nMinato: Take... My hand!\r\nKagari: ...I can't. If I do, you'll...\r\nMinato: Just take it! Kagari!\r\nKagari: Minato-senpai...!\r\nMinato: In exchange... I'll take on half of it! So just let me... Let me save you, Kagari!\r\n\r\nYukari: ...Kagari... Minato! Why... Why...!\r\nTagitsuhime: Origami Yukari. I propose a deal.\r\nYukari: A deal...?\r\nTagitsuhime: Dragged to the netherworld like this, my sense of self will be extinguished. When that occurs, I will be unable to return for decades.\r\nTagitsuhime: Nevertheless, while I will lose my self, my existence is undying. One day I will seep from the netherworld and return to this one.\r\nTagitsuhime: As one of the Origami family, who has long repeated this course, you must know.\r\nYukari: ...And what do you propose?\r\nTagitsuhime: Become one with me. If so, Hiiragi Kagari and Fujiwara Minato's lives will be spared.\r\nYukari: What...\r\nTagitsuhime: While we are one, I will lie in the shallows of the netherworld and cure my wounds.\r\nTagitsuhime: Greater than these decades, my recovery will be prolonged. If you can destroy me in the time that gives you, you will have won.\r\nYukari: That offer is insane...\r\nTagitsuhime: The likelihood of your accepting is decisively high.\r\nYukari: ......\r\n\r\nHiyori: The only way to suppress a great aradama is to sacrifice yourself by dragging it to the netherworld with you...\r\nHiyori: That was Hiiragi Kagari... That was my mother's mission. But, my mother returned to this world.\r\nHiyori: You're saying that was all thanks to Kanami's mother, Fujiwara Minato, and the contract formed between Origami Yukari and Tagitsuhime?\r\nTagitsuhime: The Origami family had passed this duty down unfailingly. However, Yukari chose to have those two returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Conclusion (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: There's the head of the family, and... Kanami!?\r\nChie: It looks like we made it in time.\r\nHana: That's the great aradama...\r\nKofuki: Ahh, it's crazy! Never felt anything like this pressure!\r\nYukari: Regardless of how many you bring, the outcome will be the same. Be crushed by despair.\r\nKanami: Gghh-!\r\nMihono: Kanami-!!\r\nKanami: Ugh... Ughh...\r\nYukari: You truly were Fujiwara Minato's daughter. One day you might have grown fearsomely skillful.\r\nYukari: But you are only a fledgling. Far from the likes of Minato.\r\nYukari: Now-- What will you do. Use the same technique as your mother? If you can strike me with that okatana... That is.\r\nHiyori: Kh-!\r\nYukari: Resign yourself. Your sword cannot reach me. There is no toji in this world capable of surpassing Origami Yukari--\r\nHiyori: ...Kanami!?\r\nKanami: .........\r\nYukari: Oh, you still have the strength to stand, at least--\r\nKanami: Yukari! Long time no see!\r\nYukari: Minato...\r\nKanami: Fufu.\r\nHiyori: Kanami...?\r\nYukari: Impossible...\r\nYukari: Impossible...\r\nKanami: Totally possible!\r\nHiyori: Kanami!\r\nYukari: Impossible, Fujiwara Minato is dead!\r\nKanami: Seems like it!\r\nKanami: But, I'm still fighting here!\r\nMihono: Amazing... It's completely one-sided...\r\nYukari: This future shouldn't exist...\r\nYukari: Ghh...!\r\nChie: There's fire coming from where she's been cut!\r\nKofuki: I've got no clue what's going on, but that's awesome! She's on fire!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Conclusion (2)\r\n\r\nYukari: Nngh... For this to happen...\r\nHiyori: It's now or never!\r\nYukari: Fourth stage... Jin'i...?\r\nHiyori: This is... My true single sword!\r\nYukari: Well done...\r\nHiyori: HAAAAAAAHHH----!\r\nHiyori: You will descend with me to the depths of the netherworld!\r\nKanami: Don't, Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: Let go, let go of me, Kanami!\r\nKanami: No! I'm never letting go!\r\nMihono: Look! From where Kogarasumaru came through her back... She's cracking open...!\r\nKofuki: The hell's going on!? All the aradama is gushing up like a geyser!\r\nChie: The aradama blowing out is splitting across the sky...\r\nHiyori: Tagitsuhime's...!\r\nKanami: ...Disappearing.\r\n\r\nThat night, as Tagitsuhime fled to the netherworld, the aradama she discarded shot up into the sky.\r\nAs it flew, it began to rain down across all of Kanto.

Whether we call it a new administration or Mokusa, it's all the same to them.

In the middle of everything, many of you are stuck fighting under harsh conditions.\r\nEma: ...But despite it all, the public isn't showing any signs of letting up, are they.\r\nMai: We just have to put up with it. It's the truth that we couldn't stop the noro from escaping.\r\nMai: ...Though I still think there's hope. Because--\r\nAcademy Intercom: Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--\r\nMai: Aradama!? What should we do, I think it's best if I go out to help...?\r\nMirja: Excuse us. I'm Kitora Mirja, from Ayanokouji Martial Arts School's high school division.\r\nEllen: Maimai! We're here to pick you up!\r\nKofuki: You've got 4 seconds to get ready! There's aradama-chan that need a beating!\r\nEllen: Have a little patience! We'll wait 40 seconds at least!\r\nMirja: At any rate, you're rushing her.\r\nMai: Everyone...! Sorry, President Hashima. I'll be going now!\r\nEma: Alright. Take care of yourselves, dealing with those aradama.\r\nEllen: You can count on us!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Hope (2)\r\n\r\nEllen: Phew, that's all of them taken care of!\r\nMirja: Mission accomplished. Let's make our report.\r\nKofuki: Those aradama were a pushover. Don't they have the real deal around here!\r\nMai: ...President Hashima, the toji themselves are our hope right now. Facing this difficult struggle all across Kanto, toji are...\r\nEllen: Maimai, did you say something?\r\nMai: No, it's nothing. We should head back to President Hashima.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Voice of the People (1)\r\n\r\nMai: --The problem Tagitsuhime left behind, the Kamakura Special Hazardous Waste Leakage Issue.\r\nMai: Because we're responding to it after the fact, we're forced to use makeshift countermeasures.\r\nMai: Toji are always coming and going, being transferred about, and it's putting a heavy burden on them. Shouldn't improving that be our first priority?\r\nEma: We'd like to treat you toji as best as we can, but the situation isn't making it easy...\r\nEma: Our efforts these past months are starting to show results, but because many see toji as the cause of the leakage issue, not all areas are cooperating...\r\nMirja: They're blinding themselves to the reality of the situation by putting faith in malicious rumors. How foolish.\r\nEllen: All these idiots are just making our work harder.\r\nMai: Ellen-chan, that's going too far. The public just doesn't know what actually happened, since a lot of it is classified information.\r\nEllen: Whoops, that was rude of me.\r\nKofuki: I couldn't care less what they think, but it pisses me off they're getting in the way of smashing up aradama-chan.\r\nAcademy Intercom: Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--\r\nMai: Again!?\r\nKofuki: Heheh, a chance to blow off some stress! Hang tight, aradama-chan! I'll be right there!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Voice of the People (2)\r\n\r\nMirja: --Mission accomplished.\r\nKofuki: Dammit, it's just the runts again! Can't they transfer me somewhere where there's tougher aradama?\r\nMai: ...I hope the toji working in other areas are doing alright...\r\nEllen: Are you worried about everyone, Maimai?\r\nMai: Mm. Compared to our assignment, those stationed elsewhere should be facing much tougher conditions...\r\nEllen: You're right... I hope Kaoru's hanging in there...\r\nKofuki: Don't waste time worrying about them. All the toji I know are the kind who wouldn't know to lay down dead if they'd died.\r\nKofuki: I mean, if this mission were tough enough to make them crack, they'd have quit being toji a long time ago. So every one of them's gonna pull through somehow.\r\nEllen: --You've got a point! Kaoru's probably groaning \"I wanna vacation...\" while she's gritting her teeth and getting things done!\r\nMai: ...Shichinosato-san, thank you.\r\nKofuki: I don't need your thanks. I just hate it when the mood starts coming down.\r\nEllen: Oh, I got a message.\r\nEllen: ...Everyone, I just got a big scoop. Let's get back to the dorms.\r\nMai: Ellen-chan, is this about...?\r\nEllen: You know it, I got that progress report back.\r\nMirja: What progress report are you talking about?\r\nEllen: I'll explain it all later! Let's go, everybody!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Progress Report (1)\r\n\r\nEllen: So Maimai and I used our connections with Grandpa and the presidents to learn what Kaoru and the others have been up to!\r\nMai: Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan, Sayaka-chan, Kaoru-chan, as well as Mihono-chan, Setouchi-san, Kiyoka-san, Yamashiro-san, and Suzumoto-san. We tried to find out where they are and what they've been doing.\r\nMirja: I see. And you just now got that progress report back.\r\n\r\nFukuda Sawano: Now then, I'll start going over the report. Of the 9 toji investigated, we were able to get back information on 6 of them, who were working under directions from each school.\r\nSawano: However... Asakura Mihono, Yamashiro Yui, and Suzumoto Hana were mainly dispatched and transferred under the direction of the Metropolitan Police Department, so we weren't able to obtain any information on them.\r\nMai: Is that so... I couldn't get in touch with Mihono-chan by phone either...\r\nEllen: What about those two from Ayanokouji, Yui and Hana?\r\nMai: I don't know their contact info, so...\r\nEllen: Do you know their numbers, Mirja?\r\nMirja: Sorry, I don't have either of theirs. I was never in a position to exchange information with Suzumoto Hana, after all...\r\nEllen: You didn't get Yui's number? I heard you two were working together for a pretty long while.\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui was very persistent in requesting that we should exchange contact information, but I sensed I was in danger and refused.\r\nEllen: Oh...\r\nMirja: Though, if you were unable to contact Asakura Mihono, it might mean she's stationed in an area unable to get signal. Or she may be so busy that she has no free time to spare.\r\nEllen: Oh... That makes me worried.\r\nKofuki: Does that mean, if you're working under the MPD, they keep you so busy fighting aradama that you don't get time for anything else? I'm so jealous. Maybe one of them'll swap with me.\r\nEllen: You're such a hard worker, Fukki. If only I could take that energy and split it between you and Kaoru.\r\nMai: I get the feeling it's a little different for Shichinosato-san than being a hard worker though...\r\nAcademy Intercom: Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--\r\nKofuki: Whoa-! Aradama showed up again! Wait for me, aradama-chan! I'll be right there to trash you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Progress Report (2)\r\n\r\nKofuki: This time's another sleepwalk. Awww, give me some stronger aradama to work with. When all they've got is numbers, even I'm getting bored.\r\nMirja: At any rate, the aradama are dealt with. We should continue hearing that report.\r\nMai: Okay. But, it doesn't sit right with me that we couldn't find anything about Mihono-chan and the others...\r\nEllen: I'm sure they're doing fine! Let's go to the dorms and hear the rest!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Two Months Ago, on a Certain Battleground (1)\r\n\r\nSawano: I'll continue with the report. Of the toji we were able to get information on, I won't be able to provide information in real time, as they were transferred around quite often.\r\nSawano: What I do know is, presently, Mashiko Kaoru-san is stationed in Gunma, and Etou Kanami-san, Juujou Hiyori-san, and Itomi Sayaka-san are stationed together in Kamakura.\r\nEllen: Hmm. It sounds like everyone really did get transferred around. From what I've heard, they might sometimes stay for only a few days before getting moved again.\r\nKofuki: What, are they touring the country while taking out aradama-chan?\r\nMai: I think that's a misleading way of putting it...\r\nMirja: Come to think of it, I don't know if this information will be of any use, but two months ago, when I had a temporary change of assignment, I was placed in the same unit as Yamashiro Yui and Suzumoto Hana.\r\nMai: You were?\r\nMirja: Yes. Thinking back on it now, it was a bit of a strange situation...\r\n\r\nTwo months ago, on a certain battleground.\r\n\r\nYui: Mirja-san! I haven't seen you in forever! I missed you so, so badly!\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui. It's been some time.\r\nYui: The two months I've been away from you, Mirja-san, felt like twenty years to me...!!\r\nMirja: Is that so. These two months have felt like two months to me, so I can't relate to you at all.\r\nYui: Ughh, you're as cold as ever, Mirja-san...\r\nHana: Kitora Mirja-senpai. I'm honored to be working together with you again today.\r\nMirja: Suzumoto Hana. Likewise, I look forward to working with you.\r\nHana: By the way, did you hear? This time, under direct orders from Ayanokouji's President Souraku Yuzuki, the three of us are to form a unit for an urgent assignment.\r\nMirja: Yes, I had heard as much. Although, she wouldn't say the reason why the three of us were chosen--\r\nHeadquarters: Aradama have been located. Toji on the scene, please take action.\r\nYui: Ehh, we're fighting already? I wanted to have a longer lovers' talk with Mirja-san though...\r\nMirja: You haven't changed, I see. Let's keep this serious; it's time to sortie.\r\nYui: Understood! I can't wait to fight side by side, Mirja-san!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Two Months Ago, on a Certain Battleground (2)\r\n\r\nMirja: --After the aradama were suppressed, we went together to report on the situation. However, for some reason, we were told they would hear our reports individually. I wonder what that was about...\r\nMai: They wanted to talk to you separately? That's strange... I wonder what President Souraku is thinking...\r\nKofuki: Oh yeah, Mirja, what's up with the investigation team? Right now we're putting activities on hold, right?\r\nMirja: I don't know. Perhaps President Souraku is considering reforming the investigation team?\r\nEllen: That has to be it! You and Yui and Hana were all on the investigation team, after all!\r\nKofuki: Getting the investigation team back together, huh. If that means sending me after tougher aradama, then I'm not complaining.\r\nMai: I don't know, something seems wrong about splitting you up like that. I hope I'm overthinking it, but...\r\nEllen: Hmmm. For the time being, I don't think worrying about it will get us anywhere. Right now all we can do is defeat any aradama that show up, and work towards making the situation better!\r\nMai: Y-You're right!\r\nKofuki: It's fine by me if things never get back to normal. I get to fight way more aradama-chan like this.\r\nEllen: Oh... The way you think about things is scary, Fukki...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: Evening Bout (1)\r\n\r\nAt that time, the three who had been reported to be in Kamakura; Etou Kanami, Juujou Hiyori, and Itomi Sayaka, were--\r\n\r\nKanami: Haaah! Hyaa-!\r\nSayaka: Pant... Pant... ...There's no opening... For me to attack...!!\r\nKanami: --Haa-!!\r\nSayaka: ...!!\r\nKanami: ...Phew. Okay, why don't we stop here for tonight?\r\nSayaka: ...Okay.\r\nHiyori: You two, you were having another training match?\r\nKanami: Ah-! Hiyori-chan! Wanna do it too, Hiyori-chan? Fighting against Sayaka-chan is a lot of fun!\r\nHiyori: I'll pass. We have work to do tomorrow, you know?\r\nKanami: Don't worry about that~. Aradama could show up at any time, so you have to fit in training whenever you can!\r\nKanami: You know, with aradama all across Kanto and everyone getting assigned elsewhere, I'm lucky I ended up with you two.\r\nKanami: It's rough having to sortie again and again every day, but I get to have these matches every night--\r\nAcademy Intercom: Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--\r\nKanami: Oh no! There's aradama! Hiyori-chan! Sayaka-chan! Let's go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: Evening Bout (2)\r\n\r\nHiyori: ...Suppression completed. It doesn't seem like there were any victims.\r\nKanami: Thank goodness we were training before bed! Otherwise we wouldn't have been able to make it out here so fast!\r\nKanami: But still, it really seems like the number of aradama are growing. I hope the others deployed elsewhere are doing okay.\r\nSayaka: ...I heard some news about Mihono before. They said where Mihono is has the hardest conditions.\r\nKanami: Really!? Is Mihono-chan going be alright...?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11: Reassignment Order (1)\r\n\r\nKanami: I wonder how Mihono-chan's doing...\r\nSayaka: There aren't enough people. There's too much to do, so it can't be helped.\r\nKanami: I know, but I'm still worried. If it's that much harder than we have it here, then...\r\nMihono: --Ah! Kanami and Itomi-san!\r\nKanami: Huh-!? Mihono-chan!?\r\nMihono: I haven't seen you in so long~! How've you been?\r\nKanami: Eh? Eh? What!? Why are you here!?\r\nKanami: I kept calling you, but you never answered your phone... I was really worried about you!\r\nMihono: Ehehe~, sorry, sorry. I was way out in the mountains and didn't get any signal.\r\nKanami: So that's all it was. Well, I'm glad I get to see your smiling face again!\r\nMihono: Sorry I made you worry!\r\nKanami: No, it's not like that... You don't have to apologize, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: We got reinforcements all of a sudden, so I was sent to Kamakura. I only just got here.\r\nKanami: Really! So that means you'll be here with us from now on?\r\nMihono: It's just a temporary reassignment, but I should be here for a while... I think!\r\nKanami: Awesome-! Oh yeah, Mihono-chan, are you feeling okay? I heard they were working you pretty hard...\r\nMihono: Thanks for worrying about me. It was so busy I didn't get time to sleep sometimes, but I'd just remember we were fixing up the Kamakura Special something or other and do my best to pull through.\r\nKanami: Ahaha! It's the Kamakura Special Hazardous Waste Leakage Issue. You should at least remember the name of the assignment you're on. That's so like you, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: But it's way too long! And there's some really hard kanji in there--\r\nAcademy Intercom: Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie. I repeat, aradama have been identified--\r\nMihono: Looks like it's back to work already! Kanami! Itomi-san! Let's go together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: Reassignment Order (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Yawwwn... In the end, they kept us fighting all the way till nighttime... I just wanna dive into bed...\r\nKanami: There's so much I wanted to talk to you about, but I guess we should save it for tomorrow...\r\nMihono: Yeah... We can talk tomorrow...\r\nKanami: And it's been a while, so I wanted to have a practice match with you, but...\r\nMihono: Are you for real, Kanami...!? We've been doing missions all day; how can you keep going...!?\r\n\r\nThe next morning.\r\n\r\nSayaka: Ah-, Kanami.\r\nKanami: Morning, Hiyori-chan, Sayaka-chan! Let's do our best again today!\r\nHiyori: Kanami. I have this letter from Mihono to give to you.\r\nKanami: Huh-!? From Mihono-chan?\r\nHiyori: Last night, it seems like she suddenly got an order of reassignment. Read the letter if you want to hear the rest.\r\nKanami: O-Oh...\r\nLetter (Mihono): Dear Kanami. I'm sorry I have to leave so soon. I thought if I called you I might wake you up, so I left this letter with Juujou-san who I happened to run into last night.\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan... You should have woken me up...\r\nLetter (Mihono): I was really happy to hear you were worried about me. But you don't have to worry about me anymore. If we meet again, this time for sure, we can have that match...\r\nHiyori: I told her this last night, but this letter kind of reads like she's going to going off to die.\r\nKanami: Hey, Hiyori-chan! Don't say things like that!\r\nSayaka: This is my first time seeing a letter from a dead person.\r\nKanami: She's not dead!? It's okay, Mihono-chan! I get what you're trying to say, okay!\r\nHiyori: The way you're shouting up at the heavens like that is only making it seem more like she died.\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan!? Why are you being so rude!?\r\nHiyori: ...Actually, last night, Mihono told me to try to cheer you up.\r\nKanami: That was you trying to cheer me up!? Mihono-chan, you couldn't have picked a worse person for the job!\r\nHiyori: ...I can't help but agree. I'm not suited for this sort of thing.\r\nKanami: ......Mihono-chan. We'll definitely have that match someday. Until then, we just have to both keep trying our best... Right?"}, {"paste_key": "EUqiZ9cH", "title": "2-4 Surprise Assault on the Origami Estate", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/EUqiZ9cH", "timestamp": "", "hits": "117", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T7N8Y0khrE\r\n\r\n1: The Operation Commences\r\n\r\nMirja: There it is; the Origami estate.\r\nYui: Nice timing! Mokusa seems like they're about to start making their move too. See, look at my phone.\r\nReporter: Hang on, it looks like something's happening! Someone came out onto the deck of the submarine! It appears to be a woman.\r\nAkane: ...Everyone. My name is Origami Akane. Please, listen to what I have to say.\r\nMihono: So that's Origami Akane-sama...\r\nAkane: Right now, the country is facing an immense crisis. Like the one 20 years ago, no, a worse disaster is about to occur.\r\nAkane: The cause of that disaster 20 years ago... That great aradama has once again returned.\r\nAkane: You toji felt it, didn't you? That strange phenomenon earlier.\r\nYui: Does she mean that sort of out-of-body experience from before?\r\nAkane: Please, everyone, lend me your strength!\r\nNewscaster: What was that? There's something else moving. Is that the hatches on the submarine? They seem to be opening--\r\nNewscaster: M-Missiles!? No, those were containers... Weren't they?\r\nAkane: This is not an attack. What we launched just now is our hope.\r\nKiyoka: Inside those containers... Maybe... It's Mokusa's toji...\r\nMirja: We're out of time. I'll briefly go over the details of the operation.\r\nMirja: As we discussed earlier, our objective is to cause disorder. To throw the enemy into confusion, and draw their attention even if we are outnumbered.\r\nMirja: The grounds cover an extensive area, so thinking efficiently, we should split into two teams. Setouchi Chie, Shichinosato Kofuki, and Asakura Mihono will form the A team. The rest of us will form the B team.\r\nYui: Then I'm on B team. Kiyoka-chan, let's look after each other! If you get scared, go ahead and hug me tight whenever you feel like it! Bring it on, don't hold back! No really, I'm serious!\r\nKiyoka: Ahaha... Thanks...\r\nMirja: From this moment forward, each team will operate by their own judgment. Even so, do not lose track and overextend yourselves.\r\nMirja: Only if each of each of you safely returns will we be able to call this our first successful operation.\r\nChie: That's right. After this is over, why don't we all eat crepes together again?\r\nMihono: I'm all for it~!!\r\nKiyoka: I'll do my best... For the crepes...\r\nMirja: Now, begin the operation.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in the Origami family Operations Control Room--\r\n\r\nMaki: What's going on?\r\nOperator: ...We've picked up an unidentified flying unit. They're... Storm armor containers!\r\nSuzuka: Where are they landing!?\r\nOperator: Here! They're flying right here!\r\nMaki: What!! Is this what's left of Mokusa?\r\n\r\nToji: Take cover! Take cover!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Distraction Operation (1)\r\n\r\nKanami: ............\r\nHiyori: What's wrong, Kanami?\r\nKanami: I was just thinking, we're back where we all first met...\r\nHiyori: ...That's true. Right, I never thought I'd be able to come back.\r\nSayaka: ...It's too soon to get caught up in emotion.\r\nEllen: Saaya's right. Even with the spare battery, the storm armor's running time is only 30 minutes. We have to defeat the great aradama in that timeframe.\r\nMai: ...Time isn't on our side here.\r\nEllen: Yes. Because of that, please turn off your spectrum finders. They'll only get in the way of finding the great aradama.\r\nEllen: If we leave them as is, they could broadcast our location to the enemy.\r\nKaoru: If the Origami family wasn't using dirty tricks, we could bring the fight to the great aradama straight away.\r\nNene: Nene...!\r\nKaoru: ...It's that way, Nene?\r\nSayaka: That way is... The shrine?\r\nKanami: Then the great aradama has to be...\r\n???: Found~ youuu.\r\nEveryone: ......!?\r\nYume: --I made up my mind. I'm gonna have you play with me, Chidori onee-san!\r\nKanami: !!\r\nKanami: Kh...!\r\nYume: Ahahahaha!\r\n\r\nAt the same time, with Asakura Mihono's A team--\r\n\r\nMihono: There was a huge boom from over there. That made me jump!\r\nChie: They must have gotten started. Then we have to cause as much of a commotion as we can and draw the guard's attention to us.\r\nMihono: Yeah! We have to go on a rampage to cover for Kanami and them!\r\nToji: Who's there; what are you doing here!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Distraction Operation (2)\r\n\r\nToji: Guh...!!\r\nKofuki: Mannn, this is a pain in the ass.\r\nMihono: What's wrong? Normally you look all smug after you go wild, but you seem pretty down now?\r\nKofuki: I'm not some kind of battle maniac, you know. I just like messing around with aradama-chan. There's nothing fun about fighting other people.\r\nKofuki: Plus it's annoying having to worry about not killing them. Can't I just cut 'em up?\r\nChie: Don't. We can't afford to risk murdering anyone.\r\nKofuki: I know already. Mann, this is such a pain.\r\nChie: Come on, cheer up and let's draw off some more guards.\r\nMihono: I'll give it my best shot, yeah--!\r\nKofuki: Yeah-, you can do it, you can do it.\r\nChie: You too, Kofuki-chan. I know you can do anything if you try, so keep at it.\r\nKofuki: Just quit being so pushy already... Sigh~, I don't feel like it, but I'll do what I can I guess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Girl Hunt (1)\r\n\r\nAt the same time, with Kitora Mirja's B team.\r\n\r\nToji A: Over there! The rebels are over there! Don't allow them to riot any further in Yukari-sama's headquarters!!\r\nMirja: A team must have begun to act. We should begin our work as well.\r\nKiyoka: O-Okay... (deep breath)... (deep breath)...\r\nYui: Kuhuu~, Kiyoka-chan's nervous deep breathing's too cyuuute~! I just want to take you home and hang you up in my room!\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui. It seems you're unaffected by nervousness at least. I hope I can count on that.\r\nYui: I never thought the day would come I'd get relied on by a hottie like Mirja-san, but I'm so glad I was born~! This feeling'll last me a lifetime!\r\nKiyoka: I wish I could have just a little bit of that mental strength...\r\nYui: Why stop there? You can have everything, Kiyoka-chan; my heart, soul and body could all be yours~.\r\nKiyoka: Ahaha...\r\nMirja: It appears Musumi Kiyoka has overcome some of her nervousness as well. Then, let's begin our operation.\r\nToji B: Where are the rebels!?\r\nYui: Oh crap! Get down, get down! C'mon, hurry, they'll see us!\r\nToji A: What are you doing, they're this way!\r\nToji B: I'll be right there!\r\nYui: Phew~, they would have spotted us for sure... Go me!\r\nKiyoka: H-Huh... Uhh~?\r\nYui: Hm? What's that weird look for? Don't tell me, you've fallen for me? Aww~, I'm so embarrassed~.\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui, do you not understand the aim of this operation? Our objective is to draw the enemy's attention, so what good will hiding do?\r\nYui: --Ah, oh yeah! I just hid on instinct!\r\nYui: It's a pretty bad time for my clumsiness to kick in! But, it's kinda cute too, right?\r\nMirja: .........\r\nYui: Ahh~n. That icy glare of yours like you're looking at a bug sends shivers up my spine! Thank you very much!\r\nKiyoka: I can't even start to understand why you're thanking her...\r\nYui: 'kay, that's enough repenting! It's all smooth sailing from here! I'll get it done more perfect than you can imagine, so leave everything to me!\r\nMirja: That's what I'd like to ask of you. I only hope you don't sail us upriver.\r\nToji C: Where's the enemy? I'll make sure anyone who turns on Yukari-sama gets dealt with!\r\nYui: Oh, she's a sitting duck! Now's my chance!\r\nToji C: Wh-Who's there!?\r\nYui: Who? Just the future love of your life, you cute little kitten you. I heard you were looking for me though; looking to ask me on a date?\r\nYui: If that's the case, all I can say is YES. Come here, let me give you a night you'll never forget! You know you want it. Just throw yourself into my arms!\r\nToji C: P-Pervert! Everyone, there's a pervert here! Get everyone you can together and get them over here as soon as possible!!\r\nYui: I did it, Mirja-san! Operation successful!\r\nMirja: ...It seems like it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Girl Hunt (2)\r\n\r\nYui: Awww~... It's too painful, using my okatana on girls like this. My heart's about to burst...\r\nMirja: However, we're having an effect. Let's keep this up and head to the next position.\r\nYui: Right, I'll join you! Even if you take me to the ends of the earth, I'll be there!\r\nKiyoka: Where does all your energy come from, Yui-chan...?\r\nYui: Eh, you want to know?\r\nKiyoka: N-No... For some reason I'm scared to find out... So I'll pass...\r\nYui: There's nothing to be afraid of~, it won't even hurt~. Too bad!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: An Overwhelming Impulse (1)\r\n\r\nYume: Chidori onee-san. You've gotta be stronger than anybody else. So if I beat you, onee-san, I'll...!!\r\nKanami: (Such amazing drive...! This girl, how is she... But... This is fun!)\r\nYume: Haah-!\r\nKanami: Amazing...! That's Ten'nen Rishin-Ryu at its peak! But, I won't be beat!\r\nYume: Pant, pant, pant...! Not... Yet... Onee-san...\r\nKanami: (Until what...? Is she in a hurry or something...?)\r\nYume: Pant, pant... This is fun... Right...?\r\nKanami: ...Yeah.\r\nYume: (inhale)... (exhale)... Here I come, Onee-san! HAAAAAAAH-!\r\nKanami: HAAAAAAHH-!\r\nEllen: ...And, right there! I'm cutting in!\r\nKaoru: Dynamic.\r\nYume: Get out of my...!\r\nKaoru: Now for some... Hachimanriki.\r\nEllen: Home ruuuuun! Kanamin's out of the park! Special delivery to Hiyoyon!\r\nKanami: Hyaaaaaa...\r\nEllen: Fufufu, too bad for you. Kanamin went flying over Hiyoyon's way.\r\nYume: I almost had her... Why'd you go and butt in!\r\nKaoru: Just seeing that look on your face makes it worth it.\r\nEllen: We owe you quite a lot for all our friends in Mokusa you hurt!\r\nYume: And so what? It's their fault for being so weak, wasn't it!\r\nYume: I know too. That the only reason they're leaving you behind here is because you're weak.\r\nYume: And that means, unlike that Chidori onee-san, without both of you together you wouldn't be able to stop me, right?\r\nKaoru: That's about right. Thought I hate to admit it.\r\nEllen: It's a good thing we have someone in command who can calmly assess the situation and make the best decisions.\r\nKaoru: On top of that, it's not just the two of us. Nene.\r\nNene: Nene-ne-!\r\nKaoru: It's the two of us and one pet.\r\nYume: Like I said, so what? Whatever, I'll go after her right as soon as I'm done with you! I don't... Have time for this!\r\n\r\nAt the same time, with Asakura Mihono's A team--\r\n\r\nKofuki: That's most of the guards around here dealt with. What next?\r\nChie: Okay, then let's change posi--\r\nToji: The rebels! The rebels are over here!\r\nKofuki: Tch... They're still coming after us?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: An Overwhelming Impulse (2)\r\n\r\nKofuki: That's all of them for sure this time, right? So, where to now?\r\nMihono: Kanami and the others are going after the great aradama, aren't they?\r\nKofuki: Well duh. That's why we're doing this raid in the first place.\r\nMihono: Then I want to go where the great aradama is too!\r\nChie: But there's nothing we can do to help there...\r\nMihono: You can't say that if we haven't gone and tried!\r\nMihono: We might not be able to do anything, but there could also be something we can do. That chance makes it worth going.\r\nMihono: This huge reaction we're picking up definitely isn't normal... I can't just stay here and leave everything to Kanami. So... I'm going!\r\nChie: I understand... Then, let's go. I don't want you going by yourself, Mihono-chan.\r\nKofuki: I'm down for it too. I've been interested in seeing what a great aradama's like.\r\nKofuki: Besides, we can't leave Mihocchi running off alone. Someone's gotta babysit her.\r\nMihono: Ehh~ I don't want to hear that from you of all people, Fukki.\r\nKofuki: What was that~?\r\nMihono: Ahaha.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: B Team (1)\r\n\r\nMai: Aradama...!? And there's so many of them!\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan, these aradama...!\r\nHiyori: Mm. The one behind them-- The third seat of the elite guard... Satsuki Yomi!\r\nYomi: .........Now go... My aradama...\r\nKanami: There! Hyaah-!!\r\nSayaka: !!\r\nYomi: ......More... More......\r\nHiyori: We keep cutting and cutting and they keep coming; there's no end to this. We're only wasting our energy here...!\r\nMai: Don't worry. Dash on through, forward and to the right!\r\nKanami: Got it!\r\nHiyori: Good, we made it past!\r\nYomi: ...I won't let you escape......\r\nMai: I will be your opponent. Everyone else, go on without me.\r\nKanami: Mai-cha--\r\nMai: This is our best option now! So hurry! We're running out of time...!\r\nKanami: But...!\r\nSayaka: It's okay. I'll protect Mai.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan...\r\nHiyori: Kanami!\r\nKanami: ...Catch up soon, okay you two! We'll be waiting!\r\nSayaka: ...Mai, are you mad?\r\nMai: ...Mmhm. I'm mad at the girl who wouldn't do as she's told.\r\nSayaka: .........\r\nMai: That's why, as punishment... I'll make you eat all my new cookies.\r\nSayaka: --I'll do it.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, with Kitora Mirja's B team--\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Wh-What...?\r\nMirja: These readings on the spectrum finder. Maybe it's a result of the great aradama itself beginning to act. But large numbers of aradama are appearing in the nearby area.\r\nKiyoka: N-No way...\r\nMirja: We can't lose hope yet. It's never too late to give up, even after everything is over.\r\nKiyoka: R-Right!\r\nToji: ...You, over there! You're intruders, aren't you! I won't let you keep this up!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: B Team (2)\r\n\r\nMirja: Judging by the state of affairs here, Mokusa's members must be heading for the shrine.\r\nMirja: We should continue causing a disturbance to make their progression easier. We need to buy them time, even if it could only amount to one second.\r\nMirja: That one second could make the difference between victory and defeat, after all.\r\nYui: Then let's keep on picking up girls-- Er, picking up guards!\r\nKiyoka: I'm glad you're with us, Yui-chan... Your cheerfulness actually helps...\r\nYui: Oh, does that mean I'm slowly but surely winning you over? Then I'll just have to keep on showing you my good side!\r\nYui: Heeey~, you there! Don't you want to have a lovey dovey chat with me~?\r\nKiyoka: Ahaha... Maybe I shouldn't have said that...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: Clearing the Way (1)\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in the way of Juujou Hiyori and Etou Kanami, who were headed for the shrine--\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Hello there. We haven't seen you since Izu.\r\nMaki: We knew you'd come.\r\nHiyori: We're in a hurry. So we're getting through here.\r\nMaki: Do what you like. But only if you can defeat us.\r\nSuzuka: We were beaten quite handily last time, but that won't happen again.\r\nSuzuka: It's meaningless to speak any further. This is a matter of kill or be killed.\r\nKanami: Those eyes...!?\r\nHiyori: That sinister glow... So there's noro in your bodies after all!\r\nHiyori: You'd become half an aradama yourself just to protect Origami Yukari!?\r\nMaki: Without the strength to back it up, justice is powerless-- There are things you can't protect without the power for it.\r\nSuzuka: And there also a happiness brought about by being powerful.\r\nMaki: If something can give me that power... I don't care at all if it comes from a god or a demon.\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, it's a rather simple way of pledging your allegiance, don't you agree?\r\nHiyori: ...Kanami!\r\nKanami: Right!\r\n\r\nAt the same time, with Asakura Mihono's A team--\r\n\r\nMihono: Hyaaah-!!\r\nKofuki: Tch... They just keep popping out one after another!\r\nChie: As we get closer to the shrine, their defenses will be getting tighter... And they're all considerable toji.\r\nMihono: Mm, we can't let our guard down for even an instant.\r\nChie: If this place is still so tightly guarded, it might actually mean Etou-san and the others haven't gotten this far yet.\r\nMihono: Thank goodness. Then we can make things easier on Kanami before they get here... It was a good idea coming here after all.\r\nKofuki: Still, it's gonna be rough taking all of them on with just the three of us.\r\nMihono: Just keep trying! So long as we keep trying, I know we'll find a way!\r\nKofuki: Like usual, you're getting all confident with nothing to base it on. But we don't have a choice, I guess!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: Clearing the Way (2)\r\n\r\nToji: Wh-What's with them... There's just three of them, but they're so tough.\r\nKofuki: It's not about how many people you've got!\r\nToji: Khh...!!\r\nChie: The guards they have here are starting to lose their resolve. Let's keep pushing them back like this!\r\nKofuki: This is where it counts, huh!!\r\nMihono: Yeah, I'll give it all I've got!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12: An Unhappy Surprise (1)\r\n\r\nHiyori: Gah...!\r\nMaki: I'll admit you've got talent, but you're still just an amateur. I'll corner you this way.\r\nHiyori: Gh... If you're... If you're already so strong, why would you accept the noro...!\r\nMaki: Heh... I've never once thought of myself as strong.\r\nMaki: The ones I sought after were always so far away--\r\nMaki: The summit I look up to is impossibly high--\r\nMaki: Just to obtain the strength to stand at their side... For my goals, I'll use whatever I can. Aren't you the same?\r\nMaki: Now, this is... Where it ends!\r\nHiyori: You might be right. For my goal... If it'll let me win against you, I'll use everything I can.\r\nHiyori: Like this!\r\nMaki: You forcefully purged your S armor!? But, that won't hit me!\r\nHiyori: It doesn't have to. I just needed to throw off your posture for a second!\r\nMaki: You mean, that's what you were after from the start!?\r\nHiyori: HAAAHHHHHHHHHH!\r\nMaki: Well... Done...\r\nHiyori: Pant, pant, pant, pant...\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: It looks like you settled things over there too...\r\nKanami: Yeah, I made it somehow. We both seem pretty tired, but can you run?\r\nHiyori: Of course.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, with Kitora Mirja's B Team--\r\n\r\nAradama: KIIGYAAAAAAAA!!\r\nKiyoka: Aradama!?\r\nToji A: W-What are they doing here!? This place should be better defended against aradama than anywhere, so how did they...\r\nToji B: We can worry about that later. We need to focus on the enemy in front of us right now!\r\nYui: Uwah, an unhappy surprise showed up-! Why did aradama have to join in now of all times!\r\nMirja: Thanks to their intervention, the guards are becoming further distracted. We can use this situation.\r\nYui: Having to fight both the guards and the aradama at the same time is just making things so much harder!\r\nYui: Mirja-san, I'll try my best, so will you reward me by rubbing my head later?\r\nYui: Just imagining you doing it while saying \"Good girl, good girl\" makes me feel like I could go out there and give 1000%!\r\nMirja: If that's what it takes to get you motivated, that's a small price to pay.\r\nYui: Yes! Lucky me! Alright~, here I gooooo!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13: An Unhappy Surprise (2)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: These aradama... They're strong...\r\nMirja: Is it the effect of the great aradama? Whatever the cause, we'll have to be careful.\r\nKiyoka: After this... I think I don't want... Any more surprises...\r\nYui: I know what you mean. Giving someone an unwanted surprise is a crime, after all!\r\nMirja: There's more coming. Prepare yourselves!\r\nKiyoka: U-Understood...!!"}, {"paste_key": "ijynHpCe", "title": "2-5 In the Moonlight", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/ijynHpCe", "timestamp": "", "hits": "111", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHGJ9WljdNU\r\n\r\n1: A New Toji (1)\r\n\r\nKofuki: Come on, there's no end to them! How many toji have they got in here? Weren't they supposed to be short on guards?\r\nChie: Yes, the majority of them should have gone to the Port of Yokosuka to apprehend Akane-sama.\r\nMihono: And imagine if they hadn't... I'm getting dizzy just thinking about it.\r\nKofuki: For real. We owe you one, Akane-sama.\r\nChie: Even with the majority of her forces elsewhere, she's still this protected. What can you expect from the one at the head of both the toji and the Origami family.\r\nKofuki: Still, she's a great aradama on the inside. Ahh, I wish this were going smoother.\r\nMihono: Sure the toji here are all pretty strong, but I'm relieved they're not using noro like the elite guard were...\r\nMihono: That's just wrong no matter how you think about it.\r\nChie: Maybe, including the elite guard, that power was only given to a small fraction of toji.\r\nKofuki: Well of course. If every one of them was using aradama, the whole world would be flipped upside down.\r\nChie: But if things go according to their plan, that's how it'll end up anyway. Above all else, that's what we have to prevent.\r\nKofuki: Still, if they actually beat the great aradama, we won't need Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu anymore, right?\r\nKofuki: Though it's not like we've had much luck while looking for Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu, or the Akabane swords in general lately, huh!\r\nChie: A-A lot's happened! There's no helping it.\r\nMihono: Right, it can't be helped!\r\nKofuki: Anyway, when's this gonna be over! Give it a rest already!!\r\n???: Ah-, there you are! So that's where you went. I've been looking all over the estate for you!\r\nKofuki: Tch... Another one!? Just sit still so I can lay your ass flat!!\r\nMihono: Fukki, stop! She's not using utsushi!\r\nKofuki: Wait, what...!? Shit-!!\r\n???: Whoa. I almost literally got in over my head this time. A second later and my neck would have been saying goodbye.\r\nKofuki: Have you gone nuts!? Or were you thinking we'd go easy on you if you don't use utsushi?\r\n???: Ehh~? It's because I'm on your side! I'm your ally! A friend! Didn't they tell you!?\r\n???: They didn't tell you? ...Looking at your reactions, they definitely didn't tell you. That's so rude.\r\n???: Aoto's Youji-san and Yamashiro Yui both must have forgotten to mention it. Those two can be so hard to work with.\r\n???: And here I was so excited to get to help out the investigation team Kitora-senpai was assigned to. I can't believe it!\r\nChie: You're... Suzumoto Hana? Am I right?\r\nHana: Good! There's at least someone here who recognizes me! And you're Chie-san; Setouchi Chie-san, right?\r\nChie: Yes. I've heard a lot about you.\r\nMihono: You know her, Chii-nee? Then she's telling the truth about coming to help us out?\r\nMihono: We could use your help, Suzumoto Hana-san! I'm Asakura Mihono. You can call me Mihono.\r\nKofuki: That's enough introductions for now. Look, another group's coming!!\r\nToji: You rebels, we won't let you get away with this!!\r\nHana: Looks like I already have a chance to be useful.\r\nHana: Acting serious is all I'm good at, but I'll do what I can here!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: A New Toji (2)\r\n\r\nHana: No wonder you were all picked for the investigation team. You're all so capable!\r\nMihono: You too, Hana-san! You said being serious is all you're good at, but that's not true at all!\r\nChie: Acting serious is all you're good at... Right. Suzumoto-san. Is it okay to talk about it with these two?\r\nSuzu: Yes, there's no problem with that. In fact, talking about it might help them trust me faster.\r\nKofuki: What are you getting at, Chichie?\r\nChie: She was sent undercover by Mokusa into Ayanokouji Martial Arts School as an informant. In other words, she was a member of Mokusa from the start.\r\nMihono: Informant...?\r\nKofuki: She means a spy. Stop interrupting over every little thing.\r\nChie: She was chosen to be an informant in the first place because she's talented. Even if acting serious were all she's good at, it helps all the more in blending in at Ayanokouji.\r\nHana: Wow... It's embarrassing when you flatter me like that... Ahaha. Still, it's true, acting serious is more or less all I'm good at.\r\nHana: At this time, I, Suzumoto Hana from Ayanokouji Martial Arts School, have been instructed by President Souraku to join this investigation team!\r\nChie: Which means you're our reinforcements, doesn't it.\r\nChie: However, I can't tell what President Souraku's intent is here. Did she send you because she already found out you're a member of Mokusa, or was it just coincidence...?\r\nHana: Yes. I can't quite tell what President Souraku is thinking yet either... But, if you'll give me the opportunity, I'll do my best to prove my worth!\r\nHana: Though... Um, I'm supposed to \"join the investigation team\", but will you let me join you?\r\nChie: Of course, you're very welcome. After all, we're both with Mokusa. Do you mind if I call you Hana-chan from now on?\r\nHana: Okay! It's an honor!\r\nMihono: Yeah, I'd love to have you with us too!\r\nHana: And then, you there, your name was Shichinosato Kofuki-san, wasn't it?\r\nKofuki: Just call me Kofuki.\r\nHana: Understood! Then, joining the investigation team from here, I, Suzumoto Hana, will be working to assist you!\r\nHana: Please look after me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Girls are a Precious Treasure (1)\r\n\r\nYui: For every aradama we beat, another one takes its place. In fact, aren't there more of them than before?\r\nKiyoka: Mm... And on top of that, they keep getting stronger...\r\nYui: Ahh, you thought so too? So I wasn't just imagining things. Good, good.\r\nKiyoka: That's not good at all...\r\nYui: But it's not all bad, you know.\r\nYui: Even if they don't want to, thanks to all the aradama swarming around, the guards have to focus on them instead of coming after us.\r\nKiyoka: But in their place, the aradama's attacks are more aggressive... So haven't things actually gotten worse?\r\nYui: That's true! Aradama never go easy on you, after all. The way they attack so stubbornly makes me want to cry, honestly!\r\nKiyoka: So it's really all bad after all...\r\nYui: No, no, that's where you're wrong, Kiyoka-chan. That's besides the point. Think about it like this.\r\nYui: Even if an aradama's bitter attacks hit you right in the soul, it hurts me a thousand times more to have to beat down one of those guard girls with my okatana!\r\nKiyoka: I-If that's how you feel... But, I can kind of understand it too.\r\nYui: Women exist to be loved; girls are a precious treasure! And that's why, going up against aradama is waaay waaay waaaaaaay easier.\r\nKiyoka: I-Is that so... But, I kind of can't understand now.\r\nMirja: Unbelievable... It's impressive how much you're able to talk in these circumstances. Though I greatly prefer it over being too nervous to act, at least.\r\nMirja: Aradama are approaching from our right hand side. No more talking for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Girls are a Precious Treasure (2)\r\n\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAAA!\r\nKiyoka: We just defeated those ones... And now more new aradama are showing up...\r\nYui: Mmm, this is a real brawl. Feels like no one else has the time to spare worrying about us.\r\nMirja: Since it's come to this, there's no point in our distraction operation anymore. It should be safe to assume our initial goal has been accomplished.\r\nKiyoka: In that case... What do we do now?\r\nMirja: The guards are struggling to deal with the aradama that keep appearing. If things continue at this rate, the aradama will overrun the estate and spill out into the neighboring city. Before that can happen, our top priority is suppressing these aradama.\r\nYui: Hooray~, that's much better than fighting against more girls!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Fighting to Unite (1)\r\n\r\nKofuki: So, how long are we supposed to stay hanging around here?\r\nChie: Until it's all over, of course.\r\nKofuki: Get real, we're going to run out of gas eventually. The faster we're done the better.\r\nKofuki: Newbie, since you just got here you should have plenty of stamina to go. Work overtime to cover for us. Especially me!\r\nHana: Leave it to me! That's why I came as your reinforcement, after all!\r\nKofuki: I was making a joke. You really are too serious.\r\nMihono: Ehh~, Fukki. Was that your idea of a joke~?\r\nHana: It won't be a problem; it's my mission after all! I'll treat it as seriously as I always do.\r\nChie: In this situation, if you could help us keep driving a wedge in, there's nothing more I could ask of you.\r\nChie: Honestly, arriving when you did really saved us. Right now, I'll take anyone who's willing to help fight.\r\nHana: I'll do my best to meet your expectations!\r\nMihono: You're strong, Hana-san, so you'll do fine! I know we can count on you!\r\nHana: But, it's been a while since we infiltrated. Mokusa's people should be here by now, shouldn't they? Are they alright?\r\nMihono: You don't have to worry about them. Kanami won't be beaten that easy!\r\nChie: If they ran into an unexpectedly tough enemy-- For example, if they were unlucky enough to face the elite guard, they might have gotten stuck.\r\nMihono: Even then, Kanami would definitely get past them!\r\nChie: As of now, all we can do is trust in them and try to make things easier by continuing to clear their way.\r\nKofuki: And just as you said that, another group of guards showed up. They're not gonna give us any breathing room, are they.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Fighting to Unite (2)\r\n\r\nKofuki: Aghh, I'm getting stressed out. Fighting other toji isn't doing anything for me here.\r\nKofuki: The only thing that keeps me satisfied is aradama-chan, after all. Ahh~, just thinking about it's getting me in the mood to take one on!\r\nKofuki: Can't we just go and raid the shrine right now? I wanna find out what that great aradama's like already. For sure it'll be nothing like the usual ones.\r\nKofuki: So you just know going up against it'll feel the best!\r\nChie: We can't do that. So long as we don't know the method of suppressing a great aradama, we wouldn't stand a chance if we confronted it.\r\nChie: We'd only be throwing our lives away. You know I won't allow it.\r\nKofuki: Awww~, but I wanna face off against the great aradama too!\r\nChie: We need to stay focused on doing what we can here so we don't regret it later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: The Price of Power (1)\r\n\r\nYume: Pant... Pant... Pant...!\r\nEllen: Ughh..........\r\nKaoru: Gh.........\r\nNene: Ne.........\r\nYume: I have to... Go... Pant, pant... I don't have a lot... Of time left...\r\nYume: I have to... Keep on... Fighting...\r\nYume: Cough! Cough!  Kh... Ugh!? I have to, hurry...\r\n\r\nYume: Ughh!?\r\nYume: Agh... Aghh... Cough! Cough!\r\nYume: Is this... It? I didn't even, get to do enough. I wanted to show everyone, an even better me.\r\nYume: I don't need anything else. Just don't forget me... That's all...\r\nYume: ............\r\nMaki: Yume? Is that you over there, Yume!?\r\nYume: .........\r\nMaki: ......Even after accepting noro to go on living, you still couldn't avoid this cruel fate...?\r\nMaki: In the end, what did accepting this power give us...\r\nMaki: Tell me... Yume?\r\n\r\nMirja: Haah-!!\r\nAradama: GGGYAAAAAAA!!\r\nKiyoka: Pant, pant, pant... After all this... I can't go on much longer... Khh...!\r\nYui: Kiyoka-chan, hang in there!\r\nKiyoka: O-Okay... Thanks...\r\nMirja: After the number of battles we've fought back to back, exhaustion is unavoidable. However, the guards are in the same situation.\r\nMirja: There's still a unit fighting them back, but as the aradama continue to multiply, their morale is dropping and their coordination failing.\r\nMirja: If this continues, the aradama will soon...\r\nMirja: You! Your formation is falling apart! Do you want the aradama to escape into the city!? This is the time to do your duty as toji!\r\nToji: Wh-What are you acting all high and mighty for, you traitor! I don't want to hear it from you!! Hyaaaah-!\r\nToji: See? What do you think of that!\r\nMirja: Just like that. Maintain your focus and deal with the situation at hand. You can cry about it once it's all over.\r\nToji: Who's crying... As soon as we finish with the aradama, you're next, you know!\r\nYui: Way to go Mirja-san, she got the guards back in order.\r\nMirja: The guards have been re-invigorated. We can't afford to slack either!\r\nKiyoka: Right!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: The Price of Power (2)\r\n\r\nMirja: We'll eliminate them all in one fell swoop here! I know it's difficult, but bear with it for now!\r\nYui: Roger that! Let's finish strong, Kiyoka-chan.\r\nKiyoka: Right! I'm not the only one working hard, after all... Hono-chan and the others must be too...\r\nYui: That's true. We can't let them make us look bad!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: At the End of a Struggle (1)\r\n\r\nKanami: This is... The shrine...? It feels different in here.\r\nHiyori: Yes. This must be... ...!?\r\nYukari: --So the two young birds have returned.\r\nKanami & Hiyori: !?\r\nHiyori: This feeling...\r\nHiyori: Origami Yukari!\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: Right-!\r\nYukari: Has the time come for you to leave the nest? Or do you yet remain as chicks... Prove it to me with those swords.\r\n\r\nGoing back in time a little--\r\n\r\nHana: Still, it's depressing thinking about the toji here. They're being told to fight without understanding what's really going on.\r\nKofuki: What, you're feeling sorry for them now?\r\nHana: No. They're still the ones who accepted this mission, after all. It's not quite feeling sorry for them.\r\nMihono: Then, what is it you're worried about, Hana-san?\r\nHana: It's difficult to put into words. Sometimes losing a life is an inevitable part of the mission. But... To be lied to about that mission...\r\nHana: I wouldn't want that to happen to me... That's what I'm feeling.\r\nChie: I understand how you feel. It's only natural to think that way, as an informant.\r\nChie: But that's all the more reason. For the sake of our mission, we can't afford to treat our lives carelessly. Right, Hana-chan?\r\nHana: Of course! My mission is to--\r\nMihono: !? That sound, it came from the shrine!?\r\nChie: Does that mean the fight against the great aradama has already started!?\r\nKofuki: Oi, oi, since when did they pass us? I didn't notice a thing!\r\nHana: In this mayhem, it's not unthinkable that we could miss them. Speaking of which, everyone! There's another group of guards coming!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: At the End of a Struggle (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Chii-nee, I think I'm going to go after Kanami after all!\r\nChie: Even if you go, you might not be able to do anything, you know?\r\nMihono: I won't know that unless I go. There might be... There might be something I can do to help!\r\nMihono: If I could make a difference and I didn't try, I know I'd regret it for the rest of my life!\r\nMihono: So please, Chii-nee! Let me go!\r\nChie: I know from that face you won't listen to me. But no. I can't let you.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee!\r\nChie: If you go alone, you might not make it. So I'll go with you.\r\nKofuki: I'm going too. I've gotta check out this great aradama!\r\nHana: And I'll join you, of course. It's my mission after all!\r\nMihono: Guys... Yeah, let's go! To Kanami! We'll all go together!"}, {"paste_key": "09qnLbK0", "title": "June Bride Symphony", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/09qnLbK0", "timestamp": "", "hits": "115", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTrLpiMGjFs\r\n\r\n1: The Wedding Event Kicks Off!\r\n\r\nNishi Kozue: Test, test. Clear blue skies today, clear blue skies today. Now testing the mic, now testing the mic. Ah~, Ah~... Mm, okay!\r\nKozue: Ahem... Acting as your host today, as well as event commentator, I'm Nishi Kozue, a 1st year engineering student in high school at Osafune Girls' Academy. And with me is--\r\nAoto Hina: Aoto Hina, her assistant, and 2nd year high schooler studying polishing at Renpu Girls' School.\r\nHina: By the way, did you know my family runs \"Aoto-kan\", the sword dealership down in Tokyo's Harajuku! Whether it's scabbards, grips, or guards, we'll cover all your needs!\r\nHina: If you're looking to give your okatana that personal touch, we're running a limited offer right now for a whole 10% off all orders! Come on down to Aoto-kan and we'll make it worth your while!\r\nKozue: Ahaha... You've got the heart of a saleswoman... I didn't think you'd go plugging an advertisement now!\r\nKozue: Sorry, we've gotten a little off track. The reason why you've all been gathered here today is to participate in a certain event.\r\nKanami: I heard this event was to make toji look more appealing?\r\nKozue: Yes, you got it! Working as a toji is a wonderful job that helps the government and provides you with many benefits.\r\nKozue: But the facts are, it's also a job with many dangers. Fighting aradama is a life risking business!\r\nHina: Because of that, and with the declining birth rate, there's less little girls dreaming of becoming toji with every year.\r\nHina: So the bigwigs put their heads together and came up with this event as a way of turning things around.\r\nHiyori: What is it you want us to do exactly?\r\nMihono: I bet they want us to fight each other live on TV! When everyone sees how intense it gets, they'll think \"Toji are so cool!\"\r\nKanami: That's a pretty good idea, but if things got too intense, wouldn't it scare people away?\r\nSayaka: Then, what if Mai makes cookies to hand out?\r\nKanami: Ahaha... Mai-chan's just one person, so I don't think she could make that many.\r\nHiyori: So, what are we really doing?\r\nKozue: We're going to make you all into \"brides\"!\r\nHiyori: B-Brides!? What do you mean; I'm only in middle school!\r\nSayaka: If Mai dressed like one, she would look pretty...\r\nHiyori: ...Why are you blushing?\r\nHina: Don't worry, when we say brides, we don't mean you'll actually be getting married!\r\nKozue: To be precise, you'll all be put in a competition to get your hands on a limited number of bouquets. \r\nMihono: Competition? And what does that have to do with being a bride?\r\nKozue: The rules are: you have 60 minutes to locate the bouquets scattered in the nearby area and return them here to the altar in this chapel. If you do that, you win!\r\nKozue: And the winners get the right to dress up in a wedding dress!\r\nKozue: We even have pros here who will give you a beautiful makeover! Make no mistake, this is the chance of a lifetime!\r\nKanami: Seriously!? We really get to wear a wedding dress!?\r\nHina: The owners of this chapel and wedding hall have gone to great lengths working with us for this PR event, so don't worry about anything on that end!\r\nKozue: All you sweet young girls, do your best to hunt down those bouquets! Then when the whole world sees how happy you look done up in those dresses, it'll improve our image too.\r\nKozue: And that's all there is to know about this event! Film crews from each media outlet are already standing by. This is a big event, so let's make it a success!\r\nMihono: I don't really get it, but it sounds fun!\r\nHina: But don't forget, everyone! A toji's job is suppressing aradama! If you run into any aradama during the competition, please be mindful and take care of them!\r\nKozue: Now, to make things fair, everyone who's interested in participating should stay here. Those who aren't, could I ask you to leave. The event will begin 10 minutes from now! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Elite Guard Enters the Bride Battle\r\n\r\nKozue: All of you toji, it's time to begin! Aoto-san, please give the signal to toss the bouquets!\r\nHina: Understood!\r\nHina: Okay, all staff members out around town!! Please spread those bouquets around-!!\r\nKozue: With that, the Bride Battle for the Bouquets starts! Everyone participating, please exit the chapel and find those bouquets-!\r\nToji A: Those bouquets are mine!\r\nToji B: As if, they're mine!\r\nToji A: Funny, I know a way to make it clear who they belong to. I always figured I'd have to fight you someday!\r\nToji B: You read my mind!\r\nToji C: Hehe, now's my chance!\r\nToji A: Ah-, Wha... H-Hey, stop!\r\nHiyori: ...Everyone left in a panic. They weren't acting so sweet. Is this really going to improve our image?\r\nKanami: Ahaha... Everyone's getting caught up in the competition because they all want to wear a wedding dress.\r\nMihono: It doesn't matter what you're competing for, of course you'll want to win! I'm not gonna lose either!\r\nKanami: Right? Besides, they made this whole event for us, so it'd be a waste not to enjoy ourselves! And I want to cross swords with all those toji!\r\nMihono: Yeah, yeah! That's more like it!\r\nSayaka: Then, I'll go on ahead.\r\nHiyori: M-Munen Musou!? She's that serious about getting a bouquet?\r\nHiyori: If that's how you're going to be, then I won't lose.\r\nKanami: Third Layer Jin'i!? Sayaka-chan and Hiyori-chan are totally getting into it!\r\nMihono: We can't let them leave us behind either, Kanami!\r\nKanami: Mm, you're right!\r\n\r\nYume: Look at them go. They're getting all worked up, aren't they!\r\nMaki: They're making too much noise; it's like a festival here.\r\nSuzuka: But is there really anything wrong with that? Things have been quite busy lately, so a chance to let loose might be just what they need.\r\nMaki: Let loose, huh. Having fun is one thing, but I hope you haven't forgotten this is a mission too?\r\nYume: Yeah, we know that already. You always worry about everything, Maki onee-san.\r\nSuzuka: I couldn't have put it better myself. It's good to be dedicated to your work, but you need to learn to relax as well, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: You want me to ignore my responsibilities?\r\nSuzuka: I didn't say that.\r\nSuzuka: I only think you shouldn't tackle every one of your duties with the same level of intensity.\r\nSuzuka: Overworking leads to impatience and opens you to making oversights. In situations such as this, it's fine to stop taking yourself so seriously.\r\nYume: Yeah see, we're here, so we might as well have fun with it! If you keep thinking too hard, you're gonna end up with so many wrinkles on your forehead you'll start looking like an old lady.\r\nSuzuka: Ufufu, Maki-san as an old lady... In its own way, I'd be interested in seeing that.\r\nMaki: Who're you calling an old lady? That's a rude thing to say to a young girl.\r\nSuzuka: Oh, you're actually aware that you're a young girl? Now that's surprising.\r\nYume: Whoa, I don't believe it!\r\nMaki: J-Just what do you two think I'm like...\r\nMaki: Anyway! In the name of the elite guard, we can't afford to let the rest of the toji get ahead of us! I'll see to it this mission's successful.\r\nYume: Mission...? You're taking it too seriously again...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Great Minds Think Alike, Though Fools Seldom Differ\r\n\r\nKozue: As of now, 30 minutes have passed since the event began. A heated battle for the bouquets has been unfolding here!\r\nKozue: We've seen resourcefulness, scheming, and even use of force! As they do everything they can to get those bouquets, the cracks in relationships are showing!\r\nKozue: Ahh~, I sure hope no one will be holding any grudges after the event's over!\r\nHina: Don't worry, it's all good. Everyone's just messing around. No one's actually going to be losing friends over an event like this.\r\nKozue: True, it does look like everyone's having a good time out there! Let's keep things fun and friendly till the finish!\r\n\r\nMihono: Bouquet, bouquet... Where's a bouquet? Don't tell me everyone found them all already.\r\nMihono: But it's still a while before they give the signal to stop, so it's too soon to give up. I'll just have to look as best I can!\r\nMihono: Wait, huh? Is that-- I found a bouquet! Woohoo, I'm so lucky! It must have gotten stuck back here when it fell.\r\nMihono: Now all I have to do is get this bouquet back to the altar in the chapel, right? I've gotta make sure no one can steal it from me!\r\nMihono: Come to think of it, what happened to Kanami? I wonder if she found a bouquet yet?\r\nMihono: A wedding dress... I wonder what Kanami would look like wearing one?\r\nMihono: With how she usually looks, I can't really picture it... But that's all the more reason... Why I totally want to see it!\r\nMihono: I'm just looking to have fun here, so it doesn't matter if I'm not the one who gets to wear it.\r\nMihono: And this was fun enough already, so why don't I give my bouquet to Kanami?\r\nKanami: Found you, Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Kanami!? ...\"Found me\", were you looking for me?\r\nKanami: I found a bouquet and thought I'd give it to you. You looked like you were having so much fun, Mihono-chan, so I thought you'd be glad... Or did you not want my help?\r\nMihono: But, Kanami, if you gave that to me then you wouldn't get to try on a wedding dress!\r\nKanami: Nnn~, I kinda want to, but if wearing one would make you happy, then I'd be happier that way too!\r\nKanami: I got to see swordfighting from a lot of different toji already, so I'm satisfied with this event!\r\nMihono: Ahaha... Kanami, I am glad! So much so that I could just marry you!\r\nKanami: M-Mihono-chan!?\r\nMihono: But don't worry about it. Look! I already got a bouquet of my own!\r\nMihono: ...See, actually, I was planning on giving this bouquet to you.\r\nKanami: Ehh, you were? ...Fufufu.\r\nMihono: It's pretty funny, isn't it? Ahahaha!\r\nKanami: In that case, Mihono-chan. Let's go to the goal together!\r\nMihono: Ah! Good idea! Yeah, let's go, let's go! The two of us together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: A White Hot Meeting of the Minds\r\n\r\nKozue: It's already been over 30 minutes since Itomi Sayaka and Juujou Hiyori began their showdown.\r\nKozue: Right after the event began, the two of them came across a bouquet together, and now their standoff continues!\r\nHina: ...Take a look! Between the two of them, an invisible war is raging! It's getting tense; neither of them can afford to let their guard down for even a second!\r\nHina: As we speak, there must be thousands of simulations running through their heads as they plan their next move!\r\nKozue: When it comes to a fight between two toji at top performance, they're almost beyond our understanding!\r\n\r\nHiyori: (This is bad...  I got carried away with the others, but now that I've had a chance to think about it, I don't care about this event at all.)\r\nHiyori: (I have no interest in putting on that dress, and I can't find any reason to keep going along with this.)\r\nHiyori: (That said, I'd hate to let it seem like I lost to Sayaka by letting her steal this bouquet from right before my eyes.)\r\nHiyori: (I don't actually care about proving I'm better than her, but there's no way I'm just going to let her take it.)\r\nHiyori: (But I can't tell... Just what is she thinking? Sayaka... Are you coming up with a way to outsmart me?)\r\nSayaka: (I'm hungry...)\r\nSayaka: (I feel weak. I should have brought Mai's cookies with me.)\r\nSayaka: (I can't eat the bouquet, so I would rather have cookies... But, if I gave the bouquet to Mai, she might be happy. If Mai wore a wedding dress... She would look pretty for sure...)\r\nSayaka: (But I'm too hungry to focus... I want to eat cookies...)\r\nHiyori: (Did she relax her body just now? No wait, I can't let myself be tricked. Are you trying to bait me into lowering my guard!?)\r\nHiyori: (Still, as long as we keep staring each other down, I'll keep wasting energy without having done anything. I need to find a way to end this as soon as possible!)\r\nKozue: It's anyone's guess how long these mind games will go on for. But this much is clear, it's an intense battle!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: The Wisdom of Weaklings, and Its Dangers\r\n\r\nKozue: Up until now we've only been reporting on the event, but we've decided it would be a waste if we didn't participate too!\r\nKozue: Which means we'll be continuing our coverage of the event as we leave the chapel and try to find a bouquet of our own!\r\nHina: Well actually, we already found one!\r\nNiwa Tomomu: Shhh! If you tell them that, you're putting a big target on our backs! Just leave that part out!\r\nKozue: Exactly! We were lucky enough to find this bouquet, so we don't need any rivals coming after us.\r\nKagami Mimi: It's okay! Mimi will protect you!\r\nTomomu: Having a toji around is so handy! The rest of us non-combatants are counting on you!\r\nMimi: Ahh... Sorry, I said that, but I've actually never fought outside of play fighting... I'm not really used to my okatana yet...\r\nTomomu: Don't worry, you're still the strongest one of us here for sure.\r\nKozue: Anyway, let's just keep an eye out as we head for the chapel altar.\r\nHina: And once we make it to the altar, we'll settle this with a no hard feelings rock-paper-scissors match! Until then, we're all in this together!\r\nMimi: Yeah!\r\nYume: Bouquet spotted-!\r\nKozue: Gehh! It's the fourth seat of the elite guard, Tsubakuro Yume-san!\r\nYume: I might be fourth seat, but I'm still the strongest!\r\nMimi: E-Elite guard!? There's no way I can beat her...\r\nYume: Hmm, so you get it already. That's right, there's nobody who can beat me, so hurry up and give me that bouquet!\r\nKozue: U-Umm, is there any chance you'd be willing to overlook this...?\r\nYume: Ehh~, but I finally found a bouquet?\r\nHina: W-We'll make it worth your while, of course-! If you leave us alone, I'll buy you candy for a whole week!\r\nYume: You will, onee-san?\r\nHina: And if you act now, I'll throw in a free set of 5 chocolate bars! What great value!\r\nYume: Candy and chocolate, huh...\r\nKozue: With how strong you are, it would be way too easy to take it from us, wouldn't it?\r\nYume: That's for sure! If I even got a little serious, this'd be over before you know it~!\r\nHina: Yeah, of course. Of course you would. So I'll even throw in a discount for you at the sword mountings specialty shop, \"Aoto-kan\"! ...Will you let us go?\r\nYume: Hmmm~~~~~~~~\r\nYume: Actually I won't! I'm competing against Maki onee-san, after all. So I'm taking that bouquet from you.\r\nKozue: W-We're done for!\r\nMimi: I-I won't let you!\r\nYume: Oh, you're actually gonna put up a fight?\r\nMimi: You might be a really strong prodigy, Yume-san, and I might not be able to beat you...\r\nMimi: But just because I can't beat someone doesn't mean I'm gonna run away. I'm still a toji, you know!\r\nYume: Nice, nice. That's cool of you. But--\r\nYume: No matter how much you pump yourself up, what wasn't gonna happen is still not gonna happen. A fight's still a fight after all.\r\nMimi: No way... I didn't even see it-- Uuu... I'm the same age as you too...\r\nTomomu: S-She's too strong...\r\nYume: Ahaha, I'm taking this now. Bye, onee-sans!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: You're More Beautiful than Anyone\r\n\r\nMaki: ......\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san. We finally acquired a bouquet, so why don't you stop making that troubled face?\r\nSuzuka: If you keep your brow furrowed like that, those wrinkles really will turn you into an old lady, you know?\r\nMaki: No they won't.\r\nSuzuka: Of course not. Maki-san is a sweet young girl, after all.\r\nMaki: Just let it go. I thought we moved on from that conversation.\r\nSuzuka: Then tell me what's the matter. Are you unhappy with this event?\r\nMaki: I'm not unhappy with it. Whatever the mission requires, I'll see it through. I'll do it like I've always done.\r\nMaki: But, I just don't understand.  Was this really something the elite guard needed to get involved with?\r\nSuzuka: Well, it has a connection to politics.\r\nMaki: Ahh... So that's how it is.\r\nSuzuka: Yes. Thinking along those lines, involving the elite guard will carry quite a lot of influence in political circles.\r\nSuzuka: The ones supplying us with funding will feel satisfied seeing it put to good use.\r\nSuzuka: And even more so by seeing us front and center in the activities.\r\nMaki: What are we, pandas?\r\nSuzuka: If we're to act as pandas, then we should put on the flashiest performance we can manage. ...This is all to give us better standing in negotiating a higher budget.\r\nMaki: In that case, you deserve this bouquet more than me. You should be the one to wear the wedding dress. I'm not cut out for it, but I'm sure it would look perfect on you, Suzuka.\r\nSuzuka: M-Maki-san...!? ...Fufu.\r\nMaki: Hey, what're you laughing at...! I've known from the start that I'd look no good in a dress.\r\nSuzuka: Fufu. True. Rather than a dress, you'd look more natural in a tuxedo than anyone else, Maki-san.\r\nSuzuka: ...Though, you worked so hard for this bouquet. Are you sure you're willing to give it to me? Wouldn't that mean losing your competition with Yume?\r\nMaki: Yume's the one who came up with that competition. I never cared if I won or lost.\r\nMaki: ...Now that that's decided, let's go. I'll escort you to the chapel altar, Suzuka.\r\nSuzuka: You'll escort me...? You say that like we're actually getting married, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: I couldn't help myself, that's all. Come on, let's go to the chapel.\r\nSuzuka: It would be my utmost pleasure to be escorted by you, Maki-san. Now, let's go. Fufufu!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: The Bride Battle Reaches an Intense Impasse\r\n\r\nHina: --Bringing things up to speed, we gave up on getting bouquets and came back to the studio here in the chapel to focus on reporting the situation~.\r\nKozue: In these final minutes, a fierce struggle is breaking out...\r\nKozue: Whoa there! Now this is unexpected!\r\nKozue: The ones who failed to get a bouquet of their own have gathered here at the chapel, waiting in a last ditch effort to steal from anyone who arrives with one!\r\nKozue: With all of them crowded in here like this, it's like an impassable human wall! Even a mouse couldn't find a gap to slip through!\r\nHina: Thanks to that, with only 5 minutes to go, not a single person's made it to the goal yet. Forget closing with a bang, at this rate, the event will end in a whimper!\r\nHina: Somebody~, anybody, just make it to the goal! If none of you put on a wedding dress, this'll be a PR nightmare!\r\nToji A: Hey, get out of my way!\r\nToji B: If you want to get through, then hand over that bouquet!\r\nToji C: Hey, stop pushing!\r\nYume: Whoa, look at all of them! Nn~, what should I dooo...\r\nMaki: Don't even think about it, Yume. If you went and did something unnecessary, people would get injured. They're not strong enough for you, so just let it go today.\r\nYume: Hehehe~ You know me too well, Maki onee-san!\r\nSuzuka: But with no one able to reach the goal, this is quite a dilemma...\r\nKanami: We can't get anywhere like this.\r\nMihono: Don't let your guard down here either, or else someone will steal our bouquets. We have to stay careful!\r\nKanami: We made it this far, so we have to reach the goal!\r\nMihono: Sure we will. I'm not gonna let it end like this after all!\r\nHiyori: Still, what do you plan on doing? It doesn't seem we can even leap over them.\r\nSayaka: It's okay if it ends like this.\r\nMihono: No way! They put the goal there so people would reach it!\r\nSayaka: So what will you do?\r\nMihono: I'll, uhhh~... What do we do, Kanami?\r\nKanami: Eh? What should we do, Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: As if I know.\r\n???: What's going on here. Why has no one reached the goal?\r\nKozue: Ahhh! Th-That voice; it can't be! Ehhhhhhh!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: The Head of the Family has Arrived!\r\n\r\nYukari: What's going on here. Why has no one reached the goal?\r\nKozue: T-Th-The head of the familyyyy!?\r\nHina: What's Yukari-sama doing here!?\r\nYukari: This event was organized for the Five Traditions... For the recognition of toji to be further spread among the people. Is it really so strange I would come to observe it?\r\nKozue: Y-You have a point!\r\nYukari: So then, why has no one reached the goal?\r\nKozue: W-Well that's because, umm... You see...\r\nHina: R-Right...\r\nYukari: Why has no one reached the goal?\r\nKozue: U-Uhh, well... Ahh! Oh no, time just ran ouuu~~~t!! We've reached the time limit!\r\nKozue: Who could have seen this coming; we finished without a single winner!\r\nYukari: ...Hm, that would be a problem. Then all the trouble of planning this event was for nothing.\r\nHina: Y-Yes... It seems like it...\r\nKozue: A-All of you gathered here~~! If things end like this with no winners, you're causing serious problems for the head of the family, you know!\r\nMihono: ......Hmm~. Then, why doesn't everyone reach the goal together? That way we can all wear dresses and everyone's happy?\r\nKanami: Ah, that could work!\r\nHiyori: Really...?\r\nSayaka: Mm. I think everyone should get along today.\r\nYukari: ...I see.\r\nSuzuka: Yes, it's not such a bad idea. It can appeal to the unity of the Five Traditions as well.\r\nYume: Ehh~, so that means everybody wins? But that's boring.\r\nMaki: Yume, you're the only one who was hoping for this to become a bigger ordeal.\r\nYukari: In that case, I'll allow for everyone here to be recognized as a winner.\r\nKozue: R-Right! Understood! Then, everybody, head for the goal!\r\nHina: Everybody, please start trying on dresses! And try to get along~! There's dressing rooms ready for you here in the chapel~!\r\nMihono: ...Everybody here's a winner, huh! Ahaha! Just look at all their bright smiles! I'm glad things could turn out like this!"}, {"paste_key": "MitBQCCL", "title": "Elite Guard Memoirs: Hakone Arc", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/MitBQCCL", "timestamp": "", "hits": "215", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKD_08Mmfmo\r\n\r\n1: Let's Go to the Hot Springs\r\n\r\nYume: Ahhh, I'm so bored-. Hey, can't we all go to some hot springs together?\r\nSuzuka: That sounds nice, hot springs.

Who's going to guard Yukari-sama then?\r\nSuzuka: I know that. It's only wishful thinking. You take everything so seriously, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: Oh, you weren't serious? ...Still, it would be good if we could visit hot springs together.\r\nYume: What if we say it's for an elite guard training camp? Then Yukari-sama will take us and we can all go to the hot springs! Like in Hakone!\r\nYomi: That's an unrealistic plan.\r\nYume: ...Wait? Didn't all four of us go to a hot spring in Hakone before?\r\nSuzuka: We did. If I remember right, it was around when the elite guard was still being formed, shortly after Yume joined.\r\nMaki: Back then we were elite guard in name only. We weren't used to each other yet, so it was disgraceful the way we struggled with each other.\r\nMaki: Especially on that day. Just thinking about it makes my cheeks burn red.\r\nSuzuka: Though it's thanks to that incident that we began mutually respecting each other's ability--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: In the Past: Aradama Eradication Operation\r\n\r\nYukari: --Maki, Suzuka. This time, I'll have you two aid in an operation to eliminate aradama located in Hakone.\r\nYukari: The scale of this operation will be greater than anything you two have been assigned since the formation of the elite guard.\r\nYukari: To that end, I've arranged for many toji to be under your command. All the equipment and rations you should need have been prepared as well.\r\nMaki: Thank you for trusting me with such an important mission.\r\nSuzuka: I'll see to it that this operation is carried out without fail.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: --So then, Maki-san. Were you planning on leading the charge again?\r\nMaki: Of course. Having the captain at the front allows you to react and give orders as fast as possible.\r\nSuzuka: Is that so. However, it's my opinion that a captain should stay behind the unit, to get the clearest picture looking after the whole group.\r\nMaki: But my unit suffers less injuries compared to others. The numbers don't lie.\r\nSuzuka: That they don't. Then this time, I suppose I'll have to stick close to you and study how you fight.\r\nSuzuka: I might even learn the secret behind your strength for myself, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: Do whatever you want. Let's go, there's aradama to cut down! --Haah!\r\nSuzuka: As I've come to expect, you handle your sword well, Maki-san.\r\nSuzuka: ---! There's one coming around behind you! I'll dispose of it! Haaaah!!\r\nMaki: -!? Suzuka, you're too close!! Give me more room to fight!!\r\nMaki: I almost hit you when I swung at that aradama!\r\nSuzuka: What's with your attitude!? I moved in to save you, you know!\r\nMaki: I didn't need your help! Worry about yourself instead of me!\r\nSuzuka: ...!! Is that so!! Then the next time you're in a pinch, Maki-san, I'll look the other way!!\r\nMaki: Good! That works for me!\r\nSuzuka: Honestly, what is with you...! ...Forget it. I'll return to the rear of the unit, like usual--\r\nSuzuka: ...Eh-!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Army of Aradama\r\n\r\nSuzuka: We've been completely surrounded by aradama! Just where did they all come from...!?\r\nSuzuka: They can't have been lying in wait for us, can they...?\r\nMaki: It's just a coincidence. Aradama setting up an ambush is unheard of.\r\nSuzuka: ...You're right, I'm overthinking it. Aradama don't have the intelligence for it, after all.\r\nMaki: Still, this is bad. We've been separated from the rest of the group.\r\nMaki: We need to hurry and regroup--\r\nSuzuka: Still, against these numbers, reuniting with them won't be easy.\r\nMaki: We need to come up with a plan. But with their attacks coming one after another, it's hard getting a grip on the situation--\r\n\r\nApproximately six hours after Maki and Suzuka were separated from the rest of the unit.\r\n\r\nCommander A: What's going on out there!? The amount of aradama hasn't decreased in the slightest!\r\nCommander B: Are Shidou-san and Konohana-san still unaccounted for!?\r\nCommander C: I don't care how big the operation was supposed to be, how can you lose track of two of our top toji like that...!!\r\nCommander D: This shouldn't be possible...!! There's no record of anything like this happening...!!\r\nCommander E: The toji on site are asking for instructions! Can anyone deal with them--\r\nCommander B: What do you want us to say!? Tell them to act at their own discretion!\r\nWatanuki Kazumi: --I've heard that Maki-sama and Suzuka-sama were separated from their unit, but how did this happen!?\r\nCommander F: Those two were fighting in the vanguard, when a sudden swarm of aradama overwhelmed them.\r\nCommander F: Their current whereabouts are unknown. The numbers of aradama in the area are too great to conduct a search.\r\nNaeba Wakako: For both captains to have been isolated by a swarm of aradama, isn't this a complete disaster...!?\r\nKazumi: It's been six hours already since they began fighting. We need to re-establish contact immediately to get them out of this war of attrition.\r\nKazumi: Have the toji on site form a rescue party, and search from where those two--\r\nCommander F: On top of the immense numbers of aradama in the area, none of the other toji have experience commanding a unit. They have their hands full just keeping themselves safe.\r\nCommander F: Given their circumstances, they don't have the toji to spare separating into a rescue party.\r\nKazumi: You can't be serious... Then you plan on leaving Maki-sama out there to die...!?\r\nCommander F: I-I didn't say that... It's just, we have no other options to work with.\r\nWakako: So you're praying for a miracle that the aradama are dealt with before it's too late...?\r\n???: Don't waste your breath on prayer. Miracles are something we must make for ourselves.\r\nWakako: -!? Y-Yukari-sama-!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: At the End of a Fight for Your Life\r\n\r\nMaki: Pant... Pant... Shit... No matter how many we cut down... There's more...\r\nSuzuka: My arms and legs are like lead... Can hardly find the strength... To grip my okatana...\r\nMaki: Phone's out of battery... Pant... Pant... Out of water... Out of food...\r\nSuzuka: If this goes on much longer... We'll...\r\nSuzuka: Since it's come to this... We may as well... Take as many with us...\r\nSuzuka: Make things easier on... The other toji...!\r\nMaki: Suzuka... What are you thinking...?\r\nSuzuka: ...The same as you, I'd imagine...!\r\nMaki: Got it... Suzuka, there's something I have to say.\r\nMaki: When you saved me back then... I shouldn't have been so harsh with you. Sorry.\r\nSuzuka: -!? ...No, I was acting childish as well...\r\nSuzuka: ...Alright. Gather what strength you have left. This is our last dance!\r\nMaki: Good...... Then, let's make this count!! URAAAAAAAHHH-!!\r\nSuzuka: YAAAAAAAHHH-!!\r\nYume: YOU TWO! I'M HERE TO SAVE YOU!\r\nSuzuka: ...Ehh? (Am I hallucinating from the fatigue...!?)\r\nYomi: Sorry we kept you waiting. You're safe now. There's a team of guards close behind us.\r\nYume: The hero always shows up at the last minute, you know! They're not always a girl though!\r\nMaki: ...Yomi and Yume!? What're you doing here...!?\r\nYomi: We came to rescue you two, on Yukari-sama's orders.\r\nYume: That's how it is! --Still, you two got beat up pretty bad, huh!\r\nYume: You've got a long way to go if all it took was some aradama for you to end up like this, Onee-san~.\r\nMaki: Sh... Shut up...! Did you come here to save us or humiliate us; make up your mind...!\r\nYume: Ahaha! Seems like you're feeling better already if you can talk back like that!\r\nYume: Anyway, just leave the rest to me!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Origami Yukari's Might\r\n\r\nSeveral hours before Yomi and Yume met up with Maki and Suzuka.\r\n\r\nCommader A: The aradama are gathering their numbers! Find some way to keep them in check!\r\nCommander B: How long before the situation returns to normal!? I need enough time for a bathroom break!\r\nCommander C: Quit complaining; you're bringing down morale! You're not the only one having a rough time here, you know!\r\nCommander D: That's right! The toji on the scene are really suffering out there!\r\nYukari: Everyone in Operations Headquarters, may I have your attention?\r\nCommander B: -!? Y-Yukari-sama...!? Why is Yukari-sama here...!!\r\nCommander A: Silence, everyone! Yukari-sama's speaking!\r\nYukari: --In regards to Maki and Suzuka, I've already formed a rescue party. I will be taking command from here.\r\nCommander C: Yukari-sama formed a rescue team...!? More importantly, she's taking control of Operations HQ herself...!!\r\nYukari: Is there a seat for me to borrow?\r\nCommander C: T-Take mine...!!\r\nCommander D: Just being in the same room with Yukari-sama; what an honor...!!\r\nCommander A: To all of you in the field! Yukari-sama has arrived here at Operations Headquarters! Just hold on a little longer! Hang in there!\r\nYukari: ...Hmm.\r\nKazumi: ...Excuse me, Yukari-sama. Thank you, for forming a rescue party.\r\nYukari: Maki and Suzuka are both very valuable. I wouldn't allow them to be lost here.\r\nYukari: --Yomi, Yume. Continue forward, suppressing all aradama in your way. Rescue Maki and Suzuka.\r\n\r\nYomi: --Yes. Please count on us.\r\nYume: This'll be a piece of cake for me~. By the way, Yukari-sama, after this is over, I want a match with you as my reward-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Searching for Their Comrades\r\n\r\n--Several hours before Yomi and Yume met up with Maki and Suzuka.\r\n\r\nYume: Ahahahaha-! Keep it coming, aradama-! Take this-!\r\nYume: --Mmm-? This one's pretty tough! Still no match for me though!\r\nYomi: --Kh! As the reports mentioned, there's an incredible number of aradama here...!\r\nYume: Wah-!? That one snuck up behind me! You pervy aradama!\r\nYume: Hey, stop-! You're not getting away!\r\nYomi: Please wait, Tsubakuro-san. We aren't headed in that direction...\r\nYukari: Yume, don't act on your own. Stay by Yomi's side.\r\nYume: Ahaha, sorry 'bout that-!\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san. Thank you for coming back.\r\nYume: You're welcome! By the way, where're we going anyway?\r\nYomi: You were fighting without knowing that...? Shidou-san and Konohana-san are approximately three kilometers away, bearing 12 o'clock.\r\nYume: ...Ahh! Is that cause of your special searching ability? You can use that to find allies too, huh!\r\nYume: Since we know where we're going, I won't get lost! So let's push on ahead!\r\nYomi: No, we need to maintain this pace with the rest of the unit--\r\nYume: The sun'll set if we go as slow as them! Do you want those two to die before we get there!\r\nYomi: ...Understood. Then, please clear a path for the others to follow, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Roger that~! Then, just follow me-! Take that-! Ahahaha! I keep cutting and cutting and there's still more of them!\r\nYomi: Haaah! I won't allow you to interfere with our mission!\r\n\r\nYume: By the way, you're pretty good for being able to keep up with me, Onee-san.\r\nYume: What was your first name again, anyway?\r\nYomi: ...I introduced myself earlier, but it seems you forgot...\r\nYomi: It's Yomi. My name is Satsuki Yomi.\r\n\r\nKazumi: Despite the number of aradama, they're progressing so quickly...!! The elite guard are on another level...!!\r\nWakako: At this rate, they'll find Suzuka-sama before sunset, won't they!!\r\nYukari: ......Yomi, Yume. Stay on guard as you advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Escape from the Brink of Death\r\n\r\nYume: --So we kept on going like Yukari-sama told us to, and then we found you two!\r\nYomi: Yukari-sama's directions were always on the mark.\r\nMaki: ...Is that, so...\r\nSuzuka: All of you... Thank you... Very much...\r\nYume: Hmmm? Are you two feeling pretty tired?\r\nYomi: They were fighting for nearly half a day. I think this goes beyond being tired.\r\nMaki: That's... Right. For a while now, my arms and legs have gone numb.\r\nSuzuka: I suppose this is what they mean by \"on your last legs\".\r\nYume: Really! Then you should just rest here and watch as I finish off the aradama!\r\nYume: Ahahahaha! Take this-!!\r\n\r\nYomi: ...Tsubakuro-san. Our mission was to rescue those two. There's no need to fight these aradama.\r\nYume: But I want to have some more fun! Don't be such a spoilsport, Yomi onee-san!\r\nYomi: ...Understood. It could make extraction difficult if we were attacked from the rear, so let's first eliminate all the aradama in the area.\r\nYume: Yaay! That's more like it! Get ready, cause here I come-!\r\nYomi: I simply destroy. --Haah!\r\nMaki: ...They're impressive, Yomi and Yume.\r\nSuzuka: Yes... They saved us...\r\nMaki: ......\r\nSuzuka: ......\r\nMaki: ...Haha.\r\nSuzuka: ...Fufufu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Everyone in the Hot Springs!\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Ahh... The water's nice... I feel like I've passed on to heaven...\r\nMaki: The hot springs after crossing the verge of death are something else...\r\nMaki: I really thought it was the end for us when we were surrounded by those aradama.\r\nSuzuka: I doubt we'd still be around if Yomi and Yume hadn't arrived when they did.\r\nSuzuka: I have to thank you all; without you I'd never be able to relax in the hot springs like this.\r\nYume: Hmph...! Hmmmph~!!\r\nSuzuka: ...Yume?\u3000What are you groaning about?\r\nYume: Your boobs are all too big, Onee-sans!\r\nSuzuka: -!? Wh-Where did that come from!?\r\nYume: Suzuka onee-san and Yomi onee-san both are like grown up ladies!\r\nYume: But even Maki onee-san, who acts like a boy, is way bigger than I thought... I wanna get that big too already...\r\nMaki: Hahaha... You know, even when you grow up, they might stay small.\r\nYume: That's not gonna happen! I'm gonna keep on growing!\r\nYomi: ...If they stay small, you could try surgery.\r\nSuzuka: Don't give her such terrible advice, Yomi!\r\nYomi: ...By the way, you two are tired, aren't you? I can wash your backs for you.\r\nSuzuka: Will you? To tell the truth, my arms are at their limit after all that fighting. It would be a great help...\r\nYomi: Leave it to me.\r\nYume: Then I'll wash Maki onee-san's back!\r\nMaki: Thanks, if you could. ...You're the only ones I'd trust my back to.\r\nSuzuka: Fufu... Maki-san, that phrase is a bit of an exaggeration in this situation, don't you think?\r\nMaki: Pff, you're right about that. Hahahaha!"}, {"paste_key": "x8TrszcQ", "title": "Spring in Full Bloom!

I've been waiting for this-!\r\nMihono: Right! I've been so excited! What's off campus learning about, anyway?\r\nHiyori: You don't even know that, and yet you were still excited...?\r\nMihono: I really like the word \"off-campus\"! I'm not a fan of the word \"learning\" though...\r\nChie: Putting it simply, off-campus learning is like a field trip. Twelve of us toji were let off duty to see the famous places around Yokohama.\r\nMihono: But I counted us up and there's only eleven people here? It's past the meeting time too.\r\nEllen: ...Sorry~! I was running late~!\r\nKanami: Ah-! It's Ellen-chan!\r\nEllen: I screwed up! I got so excited about the off-campus learning that I was up late last night, and then I overslept!\r\nNakano Jun: Ufufu. You're like a kid, getting all worked up over a trip.\r\nHasui Mayumi: Whatever the reason, you shouldn't be tardy. When moving as a group, if even one person is late, it affects everyone, you know?\r\nEllen: Uuu... I'm ashamed...\r\nHimeno Shiho: Now, now. She was only a few minutes late, so I think we can overlook it.\r\nNaruse Miki: She's right. We're here to have a good and fun time learning off-campus, after all~.\r\nKanami: Hey, hey! What are we doing first? Was it already decided where we're going and what we're seeing?\r\nFukuda Sawano: Nothing's been decided yet. The rule is that all the toji gathered get to go where they see fit.\r\nKanami: Oh, okay! Then, does anyone have any ideas--\r\nMirja:  Before we decide on a destination, there's something that needs to be done.\r\nMirja: If we travel as such a large group, we would inconvenience other tourists. As such, we should separate into something more suitable.\r\nMirja: With twelve of us, two groups of six should do nicely. It doesn't matter how the teams are decided--\r\nChie: If that's how we're doing this...\r\nChie: Tada-! We can draw straws.\r\nMihono: You're always ready for anything, huh, Chii-nee!\r\nChie: I am the oldest student here, after all. Anyway, mutter mutter mutter... There. Two groups of six...\r\nChie: And, all done. Everyone, come draw a straw. They'll all have \"red\" or \"white\" marked on them.\r\nKanami: Okay, I'll go! Mmm... It's red!\r\nHiyori: ...I'm red too.\r\nKanami: Yaay! We're on the same team, Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: ...Seems like it.\r\nKanami: You don't sound excited about it, Hiyori-chan!\r\nSawano: Which team will I be on... It's tense, isn't it? Ah, white.\r\nChie: I'm white as well. Let's get along.\r\nMihono: I got red... I didn't make it on the same team as Chii-nee, huh~.\r\nChie: Fufu, don't be like that. I'm sure it'll be fun on both teams.\r\nMirja: Now then... Everyone appears to have found their team. We should both separate and discuss where we would like to go.\r\nFujimaki Minaki: On it! Everyone on red team with me! Let's group up over here!\r\nEllen: Everyone on the white team! We're going to be spending the next two days together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Mayumi's Guidebook\r\n\r\nMinaki: So anyway, everyone from red team, let's go around and introduce ourselves a little!\r\nMinaki: I'm Fujimaki Minaki, a first year high schooler from Renpu Girls' School! I love it when everyone's getting all worked up! So let's get to it today and tomorrow~!\r\nKanami: I'm Etou Kanami, a second year middle schooler at Minoseki Academy! I like fighting matches against all kinds of people! Let's get along!\r\nMihono: Same here, I'm a second year middle schooler from Minoseki, Asakura Mihono! I don't usually go out with everyone like this, so I'm really excited! Please look after me!\r\nHiyori: ...Third year middle schooler from the Heijou Institute, Juujou Hiyori.\r\nMihono: ...Ehh? That's all?\r\nHiyori: There's nothing more to say.\r\nKanami: Ehehe~. Hiyori-chan's a little hard to get used to, but she's a good girl on the inside. Try to get along with her!\r\nHiyori: I-I don't need your help!\r\nJun: I'm a second year high schooler from Ayanokouji Martial Arts School; the name's Nakano Jun. Let's have a good one.\r\nKanami: Kyoto dialect! That's so cool!\r\nJun: Ufufu. I'll get a big head if you keep complimenting me like that.\r\nMayumi: I'm last! My name is Hasui Mayumi; I'm a second year in middle school at Ayanokouji Martial Arts School!\r\nMayumi: Onee-samas, please guide me as you see fit!\r\nJun: So lemme see, us six in the red team would be me, Etou Kanami-san, Asakura Mihono-san, Juujou Hiyori-san, Fujimaki Minaki-san, and Hasui Mayumi-san. Is that right?\r\nMinaki: Yep, that's all of us!\r\nMayumi: This may seem sudden, but if you don't mind, I prepared a \"travel guide\" for today.\r\nMayumi: If we follow the schedule I've laid out, we could see a castle, the western style residences, Chinatown, and an amusement park. How does that sound?\r\nJun: You studied up on all that? Hey, good on you.\r\nMinaki: If you've already figured out the places to go, then that's a huge help!\r\nMihono: Yeah! I think the red team should just follow that schedule!\r\nMayumi: Thank you very much! Then without delay, we should get on a train to reach our first destination, the castle!\r\n\r\nMihono: The travel guide says we should be able to see the castle as soon as we get out of this shopping district...\r\nMihono: Oh, look, look! You can see it from here! Wow-! It's a real castle-!\r\nJun: Sure is. The cherry blossoms are blooming beautifully too.\r\nMinaki: It's all thanks to Mayumi-san we got to see this!\r\nMayumi: I'm glad to see you all so satisfied by it. That reminds me, about our next stop--\r\nAradama: GRRRRUUUUUU...!\r\nHiyori: -!! Everyone!! There's an aradama!!\r\nJun: Ufufu. Today's not your day, is it, Mr. Aradama? To show up just when all us toji did.\r\n\r\nMihono: Guys! The staff at the castle said, as thanks for taking care of the aradama, they'll loan us hakama for the day!\r\nJun: My, that's awfully nice of them.\r\nMayumi: It's about time we left for our next destination, but we can't exactly reject their kind offer, can we...\r\nMinaki: It's a good opportunity, so let's get our photos taken wearing hakama! And we'll have to get the castle and the cherry blossoms in the background too!\r\nKanami: I like the sound of that! That aradama surprised me, but this off-campus learning is pretty fun! I can't wait to see what's next!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: A Lifelong Memory\r\n\r\nChie: Let's see~, so the ones who drew white straws would be me and... Mirja, Kohagura Ellen-san, Fukuda Sawano-san, Himeno Shiho-san, and Naruse Miki-san... That's six.\r\nChie: So then, since we'll be spending the next two days together, why don't we all introduce ourselves?\r\nChie: I'm Setouchi Chie, a third year in high school at Osafune Girls' Academy. Let's get along.\r\nEllen: I'm Kohagura Ellen! A first year high schooler at Osafune Girls' Academy! I'm looking forward to this!\r\nMirja: My name is Kitora Mirja; I'm a second year in high school at Ayanokouji Martial Arts School. Nice to meet you.\r\nSawano: I'm Fukuda Sawano, a second year high schooler from Minoseki Academy. My hobby is reading. It's nice to meet you.\r\nEllen: Fukuda Sawano-san... Are you the one they call Minoseki's Lord of the Library?\r\nSawano: ...The underclassmen started calling me that, because I'm always in the library. By the way, who did you hear about that nickname from?\r\nEllen: From Kanamin, Etou Kanami!\r\nEllen: She said the Lord of the Library knows what's in every book, and you helped her over and over again when she's looking up swordfighting instructions!\r\nSawano: Every book's a bit of a stretch, but I have looked through most of them.\r\nMirja: So that's why they call you Lord...! I'd love to be able to ask you next time I have a question about a book.\r\nSawano: I don't mind, but could I ask you to please not spread that nickname around any further...?\r\nShiho: My name's Himeno Shiho; I'm a middle schooler from the Heijou Institute. I'm a third year, but I transferred in mid-way so I only started learning how to use a sword last year-.\r\nShiho: As for what I like, that'd be animals! I'm looking forward to these next two days!\r\nEllen: You're an animal lover! So do you own any pets?\r\nShiho: Of course. I've got loads of them. My parents take in a lot of abandoned cats and dogs.\r\nEllen: Your parents sound great! I love animals too, so I'd love to see your house sometime!\r\nShiho: Sure thing! You're welcome any time!\r\nMiki: Seems like I'm last. I'm Naruse Miki, a second year in high school at the Heijou Institute. I plan to make a lifelong memory with you all today~.\r\nEllen: A lifelong memory? What a beautiful phrase! I want to enjoy this as much as I can with all of you too!\r\nChie: Is there anywhere any of you wanted to go around Yokohama, or anything you want to do?\r\nMiki: In order to make this a lifelong memory, I'm looking for a unique experience~.\r\nMiki: I've heard of a very exotic place called the Brick District, where you seem to be able to ride horse-drawn carriages...\r\nShiho: Horses! I want to see them-!\r\nMiki: I hear they make delicious dango there as well~.\r\nEllen: Mmmm! I can sense the perfect plan forming! We'll go ride horse-drawn carriages in the Brick District, and then eat dango!\r\nMirja: The purpose of this trip is off-campus learning, so I believe we should study at a museum or similar institution in the area...\r\nChie: Now, now. There's a lot of history in horse-drawn carriages too.\r\nEllen: Exactly! And then we can study Japanese foods in detail with the dango!\r\nChie: That one's a little harder to justify...\r\n\r\nEllen: Chew chew... The dango in the Brick District are so good. You can really taste the Westernization.\r\nMirja: Westernized dango...!? What does that taste like?\r\nShiho: Ahh! Look! There's horses over there! So cute... Let's hurry up and get in a carriage!\r\nChie: Everyone! The locals said they'll do us a favor and rent out hakama to us! Free of charge too!\r\nEllen: Seriously!? I've always wanted to try on a hakama!! It's our lucky day!\r\nEllen: Come on, Mirja! Let's change into hakama and eat dango in the carriage together! It'll be like one big lesson in good old Japanese culture!\r\nMirja: I-I understand. I'm coming, so, please don't tug me so strongly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Are You Having Fun, Hiyori-Chan?\r\n\r\nJun: They said we could return these hakama sometime tomorrow. Really, what kind folks they were.\r\nMihono: But we don't know if we'll run into more aradama, and they could get ruined if we fought in them. We should change back to our uniforms and only put them on when we're taking pictures.\r\nKanami: --Hey, Hiyori-chan? Are you actually enjoying yourself? You've been looking bored this whole time.\r\nHiyori: Just forget about me. I'm not interested in this kind of event.\r\nKanami: Ehh-? This is a rare opportunity, so let's have fun together!\r\nMinaki: That's right! Usually, the only time we get to see girls from other schools is when missions put us together!\r\nMinaki: And we don't get to chat freely on missions, so I think we should take advantage of vacations like this!\r\nHiyori: ...Rather than deepening friendships, it's more important that we keep improving ourselves through training.\r\nMihono: You're such a stoic, Juujou-san...\r\nMayumi: Though, Juujou onee-sama is top class amongst toji, so she makes a convincing argument!\r\nMinaki: I didn't even notice, but while we were talking, we made it to our next stop!\r\nKanami: Wow...! These buildings are beautiful! What are they, again?\r\nMayumi: These are western style trading posts that foreigners came to live in during the Meiji period.\r\nMihono: Whoa-! So these have been here since the Meiji period! Meiji was the one that came before Showa, right?\r\nHiyori: ...After Meiji came Taisho. Then Showa was after that.\r\nMihono: Ah-, it was!?\r\nJun: You might need to do a little more studying, Asakura-chan.\r\nMihono: Ehehe~.\r\nAradama: KIKIKIGIGIGIGI...\r\nMinaki: -!? Everybody!! Another aradama showed up!!\r\nJun: An aradama right in downtown... We should deal with it before folks get hurt.\r\n\r\nMayumi: Onee-samas, it's about time we headed for the next destination.\r\nJun: It's a shame we can't see the inside while we're here. That aradama kept us busy.\r\nMihono: Yeah, I hear you. But, at least we managed to suppress it before anything went wrong!\r\nKanami: Oh yeah! Before we leave, don't you want to take a commemorative photo wearing hakama?\r\nMinaki: That's a good idea!\r\nKanami: Alright! Hear that, Hiyori-chan! Start getting changed!\r\nHiyori: I'll pass.\r\nKanami: Ehh-! Don't be like that! I absolutely have to see what you look like in a hakama!\r\nMihono: I kinda want to see too.\r\nJun: I think you'd look real good in one, Juujou-chan. I want you to try it on too.\r\nMinaki: Yeah! With her pretty black hair!\r\nMayumi: We can spare a bit of time in the schedule to see how Juujou onee-sama looks in a hakama!\r\nKanami: Definitely! It's fine if we're a little late!\r\nKanami: So, Hiyori-chan! Until I get to see you in a hakama, I'm not moving an inch from this spot!\r\nMihono: And me too!\u3000I'll be harder to move than a mountain!\r\nHiyori: What are you doing...\r\nKanami: I'm not moving!\r\nMihono: I'm not moving!\r\nHiyori: ......Fine then. If you're making me, then I'll put it on for just a little while.\r\nKanami: We did it-!! Our plan paid off!! I can't wait to see you in a hakama, Hiyori-chan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Let's Go Horseriding!\r\n\r\nShiho: Ahh...! Taking a horse-drawn carriage was awesome-! Seeing the horses like that kinda makes me want to go horse riding now!\r\nEllen: Horse riding? That sounds fun too! Have you gone horse riding before, Shiho?\r\nShiho: Yeah! I'm a little confident in my horse riding skills! Riding in a carriage is cool too, but when you're up on the horse you get to feel the heat of its body and the muscles moving!\r\nSawano: Horse riding...!\r\nChie: Come to think of it, there's a ranch a little ways away from here, isn't there? Are you interested in going horse riding too, Fukuda-san?\r\nSawano: There's a scene in a book I read about warlords in the warring states period racing across the battlefield on horseback, and ever since then I've been greatly interested in trying it.\r\nMirja: Very well, then that ranch will be our next destination. Is that alright with you, Naruse Miki?\r\nMiki: A ranch... Horse riding sounds scary, but that could be a lifelong memory in its own way. That's fine~.\r\nEllen: It's settled! We're headed to the ranch to get some horse riding experience!\r\n\r\nEllen: Good! Everything's ready! The ranch lent us a horse, so we can ride it up this track one at a time!\r\nMiki: Seeing a horse up close like this, it's huge...! What an impressive animal...!\r\nShiho: Hey, horsey. We're all going to take turns riding you, okay?\r\nEllen: Shiho's talking to the horse! Can it understand you!? Is that some special ability!?\r\nShiho: Ahaha, nothing like that. It's just a one sided chat--\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAA!\r\nMiki: -!? There's an aradama at the other end! Look, there!\r\nShiho: Not good! It might go after the animals on the ranch! Horsey, I need you to get me after it quick!\r\nChiho: Ehh-!? You're going after the aradama on horseback!?\r\nShiho: Yeah! I'll cut it off!\r\nMirja: Wait! It's dangerous to fight an aradama alone!\r\nShiho: Even so, I'm not letting it get near the animals!! Giddy up!!\r\nMiki: A-Amazing...! She's handling that horse like a professional...!\r\nSawano: It's breathtaking...!\r\nSawano: -But now's not the time to admire her! We need to run and catch up!\r\n\r\nShiho: Thank goodness... It doesn't seem like any of the animals were hurt.\r\nMirja: Yes, thanks to Himeno Shiho's swift arrival, it seems none of them were harmed. However, you were lucky this time.\r\nMirja: By operating alone, you realize were exposing yourself to needless danger? Especially with so many other toji ready to fight.\r\nShiho: I'm sorry... It's just, when it comes to animals, I start losing sight of everything else...\r\nEllen: Well, it all turned out for the best, didn't it! It's thanks to Shiho the animals were saved, right!\r\nSawano: On top of that, it was incredible the way you rode that horse. Like a warlord straight from the stories.\r\nMiki: I'd love to be able to ride like that as well~. Could you show us again?\r\nShiho: --Hehe. It's embarrassing if you keep complimenting me like that.\r\nEllen: -! I just thought of something! While we're here, why don't we try on those hakama they lent us while we ride the horse!\r\nChie: Good idea. It's a rare opportunity, so let's get changed!\r\nChie: (I wonder... What's Mihono-chan up to right now? I hope she's enjoying herself...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: The Inn's Up Ahead, But...\r\n\r\nKanami: Sigh... We're almost to the inn, aren't we...?\r\nMinaki: I-I'm beat...\r\nJun: With all the aradama popping up, it was a real struggle sticking to the guide Hasui-chan laid out.\r\nMinaki: We didn't even get to go inside the castle or the trading post...\r\nMihono: And even though we went to Chinatown, we didn't have enough time to go in any of the stores. We had to eat convenience store bentos on the train...\r\nKanami: For the first time in my life, I went to an amusement park and didn't get on any of the rides...\r\nHiyori: I thought this off-campus learning would be a waste of time, but all this walking around has been a good lower body workout. We got to suppress aradama too.\r\nKanami: At least you're thinking positive, Hiyori-chan...\r\nMayumi: Thanks to all your hard efforts, we've managed to safely follow through with the schedule! Thank you very much!\r\nMayumi: But, that schedule was impractical, wasn't it. Because I didn't take into account how aradama might appear, we were forced to rush through it. I'm deeply sorry.\r\nJun: Nah, not at all. That tidy little travel guide of yours was a huge help.\r\nMinaki: We might be worn out, but we got to see lots of landmarks, and we got rid of the aradama fast, so the trip really feels complete!\r\nMihono: Coming up with such a precise schedule must have been tough, right? You even looked up all the train times...\r\nMayumi: I like scheduling. So I tried my best to let you all get the most out of this.\r\nJun: That reminds me, Hasui-chan? It's only 5 in the evening, and there's still plenty of time before dinner's served, so why'd we have to hurry on back to the inn?\r\nMayumi: Isn't that obvious! After 5 is when the city's nightlife starts, and that's not something for students to participate in!\r\nMihono: Nightlife after 5...?\r\nKanami: Hey, when we get to the inn, what should we do? I want to go exploring the place!\r\nMihono: Exploring the inn! That sounds cool!\r\nHiyori: Are you little kids...!?\r\nMayumi: Hang on! It's in the schedule that, before we eat dinner, we'll take baths!\r\nMinaki: We're even on the schedule in the inn!?\r\nMayumi: Of course. After eating dinner we'll play cards for 45 minutes, and then have a pillow fight until lights out at 9pm.\r\nMinaki: Even goofing off is on the schedule!\r\nMayumi: We'll wake up the next morning at 5am, then we'll have 15 minutes to ready ourselves, followed by 30 minutes of bathtime. It's important to provide some leisure time taking care of yourself in the morning, after all.\r\nJun: Umm. I feel like there's nothing leisurely sounding about waking up at 5 though...\r\nMinaki: But, we did agree to follow the schedule, after all! We should see it through till the end!\r\nKanami: You're right! And if we don't stick to it, we'll never be able to wake up at 5!\r\nMayumi: Thank you very much! The off-campus learning doesn't end until the trip's over! Let's try to stay focused until then!\r\nKanami: Yeah-!!\r\nMihono: ...That means, I have to get up at 5 too, doesn't it...? Can I actually do that...?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Nightlife\r\n\r\nChie: The sun's fully set by now, hasn't it. I lost track of time with how much fun we were having riding horses at the ranch.\r\nSawano: We don't need to check-in at the inn until 8 o'clock. That means we still have an hour of free time, so what should we do?\r\nEllen: I'm already hungry, but I want to stay out having a good time as long as we can!\r\nMiki: I feel the same way~. Let's take a stroll down the streets in the night lighting and make some lifelong memories!\r\nMiki: I want to get some photos taken wearing the hakama we borrowed as well~.\r\nMirja: Exploring the nightlife isn't so commendable, but we can make an exception today.\r\nMirja: However, as soon as we've arrived at the inn and eaten, I want everyone in the bath and then bed, understood?\r\nEllen: Ehh-!? But I wanted to have a pillow fight! And then play cards, and do a test of courage! I heard those are unbreakable traditions for Japanese students!\r\nMiki: A pillow fight, cards, and a test of courage! That sounds like a lifelong memory in the making!\r\nMirja: How many lifelong memories do you plan on experiencing today, Naruse Miki...?\r\nMiki: I'll take every one I can come across~.\r\nShiho: Ahh! Everybody! There's a neat looking souvenir shop over there!\r\nChie: Come to think of it, I was wondering when I'd be able to get souvenirs for everyone back at school.\r\nEllen: I want to get something for Kaoru and Grandpa!\r\nShiho: We should buy some now so we aren't in a rush getting it done tomorrow.\r\nMiki: Maybe I can find a souvenir to leave a lifelong memory on someone...~\r\nSawano: I think your expectations for souvenirs might be a little too high...\r\n\r\nChie: Ooh... They sell folding fans and hairpins, along with sweets here.\r\nEllen: Oh-! This present! The Japanese design is so cute! I think Grandpa would like an ornate hairpin like this!\r\nSawano: You mean for your grandfather? Those are usually used to do up a woman's hair, so I don't think a man would want one...\r\nMiki: It would certainly be a lifelong memory, though~.\r\nMiki: --Ah! Everyone! We should all buy these Japanese umbrellas! Then we can get our photos taken! It would look wonderful together with our hakama!\r\nEllen: ...Umbrella and hakama! That's an awesome idea! Let's pick out umbrellas for all of us--\r\nAradama: GURURUUUUUUU...!\r\nChie: -!? Where did that aradama's roar come from!!\r\nMirja: From outside the shop! Everyone! Hurry!\r\n\r\nMiki: Now, since we safely defeated it, let's all get changed to take a commemorative photo here~.\r\nMirja: Fufufu. That's certainly a lifelong memory, isn't it.\r\nEllen: The shop gave us some umbrellas as a present! They said it's thanks for defeating the aradama! Let's get them in the photo!\r\nSawano: A present, huh. It makes me feel a little guilty.\r\nShiho: Then, let's make up for it by buying tons of souvenirs before we go. That way everyone's happy.\r\nChie: These umbrellas are so beautiful... I'm glad. I'll be sure to make good use of it.\r\nEllen: Mmhmm, it totally suits you, Chie! Like a real \"Yamato Nadeshiko\"!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Off-Campus Learning, Finished!\r\n\r\nKanami: Man, what a refreshing morning!\r\nMinaki: I know! I was still pretty tired waking up at 5, but after relaxing in the bath, I'm feeling better than ever!\r\nKanami: And we have plenty of time to pick out souvenirs!\r\nJun: It's pretty nice actually, following a strict schedule.\r\nMayumi: Ehehe. I'm glad to hear you're happy with it.\r\nMayumi: If there's ever another opportunity like this, I'll come up with an even more perfect travel guide for you!\r\nMihono: Nnng... I should've... Slept some more... I knew it... I'm sleepy...\r\nKanami: Come on, Mihono-chan! It's the second day of our trip! It's time to start getting excited!\r\nHiyori: ...Anyway, are the other 6 from the white team not coming?\r\nMayumi: Mm! They're late, aren't they. We were supposed to meet at check-out time by the gift shop, and yet...\r\nMihono: They're late? That's weird... Chii-nee and Mirja-san are on that team, after all? Those two are never late for anything...\r\nChie: ...Oh? Is everyone from the red team picking out souvenirs?\r\nMihono: Huh!? It's the white team! Why don't you have your luggage with you!?\r\nMiki: Why? Well, we're getting in the baths now~.\r\nMayumi: Now!? But we were supposed to check-out at 8!?\r\nSawano: ? Check-out is at 10 o'clock, so there's still 2 hours of free time.\r\nMihono: --Ehhhhh-!? Seriously!?\r\nMayumi: ...Let's see. It seems I might have been mistaken about the check-out time when I was drawing up the schedule...\r\nMirja: Check-in last night had to be before 8pm. I assume that's where the misunderstanding came from.\r\nMayumi: ...It's all my fault!! I'm so sorry for everything!!\r\nJun: There's no need for you to feel responsible, Hasui-chan. Everybody makes mistakes.\r\nMinaki: Right! None of us chcked the right time either, so it's our fault too!\r\nKanami: In fact, I'm glad we get 2 extra hours to lounge around the inn!\r\nMayumi: O-Onee-samas...!! Thank you so much!\r\nMihono: I know! Since we have the time, let's get in the baths again! We can join the white team!\r\nEllen: Sounds good! We can join forces from here! It'll be more fun that way!\r\nShiho: You know, it really feels like our off-campus learning trip is complete.\r\nMiki: I know~. We experienced so many things. There's no problem finding a lifelong memory in all that~!\r\nEllen: How did things go for everyone on the red team?\r\nKanami: We found a lifelong memory too, of course! I got to see Hiyori-chan in a hakama!\r\nMihono: Yeah! She looked so natural wearing it! The photos turned out great too~!\r\nHiyori: Hey, when did you...!\r\nChie: Ufufu, it sounds like you had a good time.\r\nEllen:  That's great! I want to go around with the rest of you next time; I wish we could do this every month!"}, {"paste_key": "kWmJ3w8w", "title": "Elite Guard Memoirs: Cherry Blossom Arc", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/kWmJ3w8w", "timestamp": "", "hits": "64", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y-R-16Cves\r\nChapter 8 was voiced live on a stream, there's a link down below to it.\r\n\r\n1: What Yume's Up To\r\n\r\nYume: Maki onee-san! Suzuka onee-san! Good timing! Hey, do you two have any plans this weekend?\r\nMaki: What's the rush? You came bursting in here without even knocking.\r\nYume: I wanna know if you two are busy this weekend!\r\nSuzuka: You can take a look at our schedules if you like. We don't distinguish between weekdays and weekends.\r\nYume: Dang, what's with this schedule? There isn't a single break in here!\r\nMaki: Unlike you, we need to do more than just suppressing aradama.\r\nMaki: And besides, aradama don't take days off either.\r\nSuzuka: That's right. On top of suppressing aradama, we need to conduct a prior investigation, confirm the results of the investigation, secure personnel to plan the operation, prepare the necessary equipment, as well as...\r\nYume: Okay, okay, I heard you the first time! You two are busy, I get it already!\r\nYume: Then I'll change the question. What were you assigned this weekend?\r\nMaki: That's unlike you. Why are you so interested in what we're doing this weekend?\r\nYume: C'mon, just tell me!\r\nMaki: I think I had to lead an aradama cleanup operation in the southern part of the Izu peninsula. Isn't that right, Suzuka?\r\nSuzuka: That's right. As for me, I'll be spending a day conducting an investigation throughout the entire northern Kanto region.\r\nSuzuka: Reports of aradama infestations in the area have increased lately, so I will be searching for a connection.\r\nYume: Hm~. Okay... I got it!\r\nYume: Maki onee-san's going to southern Izu, and Suzuka onee-san's going to northern Kanto! I got it! Seeya!\r\nMaki: What's gotten into Yume...\r\nSuzuka: I know... She's never been interested in our plans before.\r\nSuzuka: There's never a dull moment with that girl.\r\n\r\nYume: Even if there's hundreds of aradama, me and Nikkari Ao'e can handle it just fine. I don't even need any investigations or planning.\r\nYume: Aradama cleanup in the southern Izu peninsula. For personal reasons, Tsubakuro Yume's going at it alone-!\r\n\r\nYume: I did it! Let's see~, next was Suzuka onee-san's northern Kanto? That's pretty far, but I'll do my best!\r\nYume: They're gonna be so surprised!\r\n\r\nMaki: ...What's this?\r\nMaki: \"Postponement of the Aradama Cleanup Operation in the Southern Izu Peninsula\"...?\r\nMaki: \"This is a notice that the planned operation has hereby been postponed... The cleanup operation that was scheduled to begin at 2:00 has been postponed, as we can no longer confirm the existence of aradama in the area...\"\r\nSuzuka: It seems your workload has been lightened, Maki-san. Isn't that nice.\r\nMaki: Mm, it's a big help, but aradama don't disappear on their own. I wonder what caused this.\r\nMaki: ...Maybe I'll have someone look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Suspicious Yume\r\n\r\nMaki: Hm...\r\nSuzuka: What's that you're reading?\r\nSuzuka: Ahh, this is the detailed report on the aradama that disappeared earlier, isn't it?\r\nMaki: Yeah. Judging from the state of the area, there's a high chance they were exterminated after a struggle with someone...\r\nSuzuka: Exterminated... So this was the work of a toji then.\r\nMaki: ...Seems like it.\r\nYume: Excuse me~!\r\nYume: Oh good, Maki onee-san, Suzuka onee-san. I was looking for you.\r\nMaki: Yume.\r\nYume: Hey, hey, did you get some kind of report or message or anything!?\r\nMaki: A report?\r\nYume: Yeah, like about the aradama in southern Izu!\r\nMaki: Ahh, one came in. It said they couldn't confirm the existence of the aradama in the southern Izu peninsula, so the cleanup operation's been postponed.\r\nYume: Ah, so you heard already? Good~!\r\nMaki: Already...? Did you know about this, Yume?\r\nYume: N-No way, I didn't know! I had no idea~! This is the first I've heard about it, I'm surprised-!\r\nSuzuka: ...I see.\r\nSuzuka: Oh...? Yume, I can smell the distinct scent of freshly cut aradama coming off of you.\r\nYume: Eh!? That's a smell?\r\nYume: That's weird, I took a bath right after I got home too... Sniff, sniff... Do I smell?\r\nSuzuka: Oh my, and there's a bit of noro stuck to your back!\r\nYume: Ehh!? Where, where? Was it from when I beat those aradama!? Ughh, I can't see back there...!\r\nMaki: Yume... There's no smell or noro.\r\nYume: Y-You tricked me, Suzuka onee-san!\r\nMaki: Yume... Is there something you're hiding from us?\r\nYume: N-N-N-Nothing at all~! See you later-!\r\nSuzuka: Suspicious, isn't it...\r\nMaki: That goes beyond suspicious.\r\n\r\nYume: Phew~, that was a close one. They almost figured it out.\r\nYume: I need to keep this a tight secret until the mission's complete. So everyone just thinks I'm on a normal vacation.\r\nYume: Alright, Maki onee-san's weekend is taken care of! Now for Suzuka onee-san's!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Situation Cleared!\r\n\r\nYume: Let's see~, the next one was Suzuka onee-san's in northern Kanto, wasn't it. Northern Kanto, northern Kanto... Ah, here it is.\r\nYume: \"April: Northern Kanto Aradama Investigation Plans. Investigation is to be carried out in the following four prefectures: Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama...\"\r\nYume: Huh... Was northern Kanto always this big? Wasn't it just around the top of Tokyo!?\r\nYume: Ah... Now that I look at it, the Tokyo area's pretty big too...\r\nYume: Hinohara Village... Village...!? There's a village in Tokyo too, huh...\r\nYume: I didn't think I'd be learning so much. I don't really read this stuff most of the time...\r\nYume: I'll have to look over them more from now on, to be more like Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san.\r\nYume: Hm~, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, and Saitama? Well, I'll figure it out.\r\nYume: Okay-! I'll go after Gunma first, then I'll go clockwise through Tochigi, Ibaraki, and Saitama!\r\nYume: Let's get to it~! ...Ah, oh yeah! This one could take a while, so I'll bring chocolate bars and some tea with me.\r\n\r\nYume: Aradama cleanup in the whole area of northern Kanto. For personal reasons, Tsubakuro Yume's going at it alone-!\r\n\r\nYume: There! All aradama exterminated in the four areas of northern Kanto! The situation's cleared!\r\nYume: ...Wait, it's not like I have to report this to anyone, since I'm doing it on my own.\r\nYume: Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san's schedules should be freed up now. Next is Yukari-sama.\r\nYume: If I can get Yukari-sama's schedule cleared, Yomi onee-san shouldn't be busy anymore either. Just 1/3rd to go, that's all I have to do-!\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Oh... \"April: Northern Kanto Aradama Investigation Requesting Postponement\"...?\r\nSuzuka: \"During an advance investigation of the area planned for April's Northern Kanto aradama investigation, the spectrum finder could not detect any signs of aradama. As a result, I request that the investigation be temporarily postponed...\"\r\nMaki: What a weird coincidence.\r\nSuzuka: I know... How bizarre for both of our plans to have been cancelled at once like that.\r\nMaki: Weird coincidences are sometimes inevitable... Though I think I'll look into this.\r\nSuzuka: Fufufu. But you already know who's behind it, don't you, Maki-san?\r\nMaki: What's gotten into her this time... It's unbelievable.\r\nMaki: Is she trying to give us less work, or more? I can't even tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Yume's Trying her Best\r\n\r\nYume: Excuuuse me~! It's Yume-!\r\nSuzuka: What is it, Yume-san?\r\nYume: Suzuka onee-san! Did you hear anything about that aradama investigation this weekend?\r\nSuzuka: I did. Since they could no longer detect aradama in northern Kanto, the investigation has been delayed...\r\nYume: Mmhm, I see-!\r\nYume: (Nice~, everything's going great. I knew I could do it!)\r\nMaki: Yume... What are you trying to do?\r\nYume: Eh? What do you mean? I don't get it-.\r\nMaki: Sigh...\r\nYume: You two just don't have to worry about it! Ah, by the way, do you know what Yukari-sama's schedule is like this weekend?\r\nSuzuka: She should have many things planned, but I'm afraid I don't know the specifics.\r\nSuzuka: The exact hours might change as well, so you should ask Yukari-sama personally. Or maybe Yomi would know, since she's generally at Yukari-sama's side.\r\nYume: Hmmm, I guess I'll have to ask Yukari-sama herself then...\r\nYume: But anyway, if her hours are that confusing, isn't Yukari-sama too busy? This is a real black company. She's gonna work herself to death.\r\nMaki: As the head of the Origami family, she's vital to all anti-aradama countermeasures. She's busier than most politicians or CEOs would be.\r\nMaki: Even more so, she's kept up that lifestyle for over 20 years. You can't help but respect her.\r\nYume: (But I think she should take more breaks... Not just Yukari-sama, but Maki onee-san, Suzuka onee-san, and Yomi onee-san too.)\r\nYume: Thanks, I got it-! I'll ask Yukari-sama about her plans this weekend.\r\nMaki: Oi, Yume! Don't go bothering Yukari-sa--\r\nMaki: ...And she's gone already.\r\nSuzuka: There's no stopping her... I wonder what she thinks she's up to.\r\n\r\nYume: Okay, time to finish this off with Yukari-sama!\r\nYume: But, Suzuka onee-san said Yukari-sama had many things planned... \"Many\".\r\nYume: Maybe getting all of them done is going to be really tough...\r\nYume: No, it'll be alright! Just like how I took care of those aradama all across northern Kanto in just one day!\r\nYume: You can do it, you can do it! You can do it, Yume! You just have to try, so hang in there, don't give up-!\r\nYume: Yeahhh~~~!\r\n\r\nYomi: ...? Is that...?\r\nYukari: What is it?\r\nYomi: It's nothing... I only saw Tsubakuro-san outside the window... She seemed to be raising her fists and shouting.\r\nYukari: Hm... Some sort of ritual? Or rather, could it be some new dance craze?\r\nYomi: I haven't heard of any craze like that...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Maki and Suzuka's Investigation\r\n\r\nMaki: I still don't know what Yume's after, but if we keep ignoring her she's going to cause trouble for Yukari-sama...\r\nSuzuka: It would certainly be a problem if it came to that.\r\nSuzuka: Oh... Maki-san. I've just received a report on Yume's activities.\r\nMaki: Well?\r\nSuzuka: For the past few days, a member of the Special Sword Administration Bureau has been accompanying her and observed her suppressing aradama.\r\nMaki: I figured. If Yume really was running off suppressing aradama, I didn't think she'd be able to do it alone.\r\nMaki: She might have been able to fight by herself, but there's no way she could travel such long distances without help, and she'd need people to collect the noro when she's done too.\r\nSuzuka: Right... According to the one who was with her, she first traveled to fight the aradama in the southern peninsula of Izu.\r\nSuzuka: The following day, it appears she began in the morning and spent many hours systematically suppressing the aradama in all four prefectures of northern Kanto.\r\nMaki: The Izu peninsula and northern Kanto...\r\nMaki: So like we thought, she's been heading to the regions we were supposed to go and eliminating the aradama for us...\r\nSuzuka: Really though, that girl always manages to surprise me. Ordinarily it would take dozens of toji to accomplish what she was able to do by herself.\r\nMaki: But what's her goal...?\r\nSuzuka: She may have always loved to fight, but I've never seen her go so far out of her way to hunt aradama.\r\nMaki: She asked about our plans this weekend, so it must have to do with that.\r\nSuzuka: ...She may have been trying to clear up our schedules.\r\nMaki: In that case... I feel a little sorry for her.\r\nMaki: She might be at the top among the elite guard when it comes to skill, but she's still a kid. And it hasn't been long since she joined us...\r\nMaki: So I don't think she really understands how \"missions\" work yet.\r\nSuzuka: That's right. After all, we've already been assigned another mission in place of the ones that were postponed.\r\nMaki: And assuming she is trying to free up our schedules, that's just impossible when it comes to Yukari-sama.\r\nMaki: On top of that... Why does she want us all available this weekend?\r\nSuzuka: Surely she wants us all to play together with her.\r\nMaki: If that's the case, she can do that whenever we have free time. But this is going to some pretty extreme lengths.\r\nMaki: So why is she suddenly doing it this weekend...?\r\n\r\nYume: Hmm, Yukari-sama and Yomi onee-san are both gone today, so I couldn't ask them about their plans this weekend-. I'll have to go ask tomorrow.\r\nYume: And while I've got free time now, I can get everything ready! Good thinking, Yume!\r\nYume: I already bought the picnic blanket, so now I need enough food for 5 people.\r\nYume: I'll get drinks for everyone too... Wait-!? What if Yukari-sama wants alcohol?\r\nYume: Should I get some alcohol too? But I can't really picture her drinking it...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: The Plan Falls Apart\r\n\r\nYume: Yukari-sama~! I need to talk...\r\nYume: As if! Hya-!!\r\nYume: Aww, come on! I thought I'd get you today~.\r\nYomi: .........Tsubakuro-san. You're abrupt as always.\r\nYume: Oh, Yomi onee-san, you're here too. That'll make this easy~!\r\nYume: Hey, Yukari-sama! Do you have any plans this weekend? You too, Yomi onee-san!\r\nYukari: Plans this weekend...? I'll be discussing the budget with 14 government officials representing each ministry, as well as entering personnel negotiations with the National Police Agency.\r\nYukari: Afterwards, I believe there were three research institutions that asked for my inspection. Isn't that right, Yomi?\r\nYomi: Yes. Konohana-san will be needed elsewhere, so this time I will be escorting you.\r\nYukari: There you have it. But why do you ask?\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, if you would like to know more... Please look over the schedule in detail on this tablet.\r\nYume: ......What? This isn't just Yukari-sama.\r\nYume: There's Maki onee-san, and Suzuka onee-san, and Yomi onee-san too... Everyone's schedules are packed!\r\nYume: I thought Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san weren't busy anymore?\r\nYume: ...I mean, that's what the reports I heard come in said!\r\nYomi: Because they were available, they were given new assignments. As a matter of course.\r\nYume: ...And what am I supposed to do about meeting with all those big government people!\r\nYume: I'm not gonna be able to help with that...!\r\nYomi: Of course not.\r\nYukari: Yume, you are very capable. But essentially, you are still only a student.\r\nYukari: To accompany me as my escort means joining me in consulting with members of the administration. You aren't suited for it like Maki, Suzuka, or Yomi are.\r\nYomi: Now then, Tsubakuro-san. What were you planning to do knowing Yukari-sama's schedule?\r\nYume: Oh... Of course. So it wasn't going to work from the start, huh.\r\nYume: Then just forget about it, Yukari-sama, and Yomi onee-san!\r\nYume: It doesn't matter anymore...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Her Reason\r\n\r\nYume: It doesn't matter anymore...!\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san...?\r\nYukari: She ran off.\r\nYomi: Was something wrong...?\r\nMaki: Excuse us.\r\nMaki: About our visit to Renpu Girls' School this weekend, we've compiled a summary of the points of our inspection we'd like you to review.\r\nSuzuka: Here they are.\r\nYukari: Hm, I see. I'll look over it.\r\nSuzuka: On a side note... We passed Yume in the hall just now. She seemed awfully heartbroken about something... Did something happen?\r\nYomi: I don't fully understand it. She came to ask about Yukari-sama's plans this weekend. After hearing she was busy, she suddenly began acting resentful.\r\nSuzuka: I see... After all, when it comes to Yukari-sama...\r\nYomi: Do either of you know what that might have been about?\r\nYukari: Maki, Suzuka. This has something to do with the sudden shift in your assignments this weekend, doesn't it?\r\nMaki: You noticed that...?\r\nYukari: It's my role as the leader of the Special Ritual Squad. I'm aware of all changes that affect you, regardless of how large or small.\r\nYukari: I'm also aware of Yume's unauthorized efforts in clearing the aradama out of the southern Izu and northern Kanto areas.\r\nMaki: Even while busy with your own duties, to be so mindful... I shouldn't expect any less of you. In Yume's case, she went to deal with those aradama after confirming Suzuka and my assignments this weekend.\r\nMaki: She was likely hoping that, by taking care of it in advance, our schedules would be cleared up this weekend.\r\nMaki: But I'm not sure why she wanted us available...\r\nYukari: This is a list of the items Yume purchased at a store yesterday. It showed up on her expense report.\r\nSuzuka: A picnic blanket, bottled drinks... And she bought quite a lot of food.\r\nYukari: Enough for a small party. Though, too much to take on a long trip or out hiking.\r\nYukari: And according to the forecast, it seems the cherry blossoms will be in full bloom this weekend.\r\nYomi: Oh... I see. ...That's what she's after.\r\nMaki: Ahh... When you think about it, it's pretty simple.\r\nSuzuka: ...If that's the case, I would like to reward Yume for her efforts...\r\nSuzuka: For suppressing the aradama in southern Izu and northern Kanto-- Yume may be extraordinarily skilled, but even for her it must have been difficult...\r\nYomi: She must have been looking forward to it... Considering her history, this may have been the first time she could see the cherry blossoms in person...\r\nYukari: Hm... Very well then, Maki, Suzuka. I have new orders for you.\r\nYukari: Adjust the entire schedule of the elite guard up until this weekend. Advance everything by one day.\r\nSuzuka: We'll get to work on it.\r\nMaki: Understood. Thank you.\r\nYukari: Yomi, contact the related officials. Notify them the negotiations and discussions I planned to have this weekend will need to be accelerated.\r\nYukari: Also, the three inspections will need to be cancelled. Tell them to submit a report of the necessary information pertaining to their circumstances according to their own judgment.\r\nYomi: Understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(This chapter was actually voiced live on a stream if you want to listen along)\r\nhttps://youtu.be/uAtUE2imzoU?t=1h24m34s\r\n8: Dreams Come True\r\n\r\nYume: Ahhh...\r\nYume: ...You don't get to see this year's cherry blossoms next year. And this was the perfect timing, since they're in full bloom this weekend too...\r\nYume: I left everyone a message telling them to come at least... But I know they won't make it.\r\nYume: ...Even though I tried my best to see this with them...\r\nMaki: So that's what you were up to after all.\r\nSuzuka: It's true, it's beautiful here.\r\nYume: ...!! Maki onee-san, and Suzuka onee-san too!\r\nYume: Weren't you busy with something else? I saw it. Your schedules were packed.\r\nMaki: We moved all our plans up so we could clear the whole day today. I've been losing sleep over it.\r\nSuzuka: But you can't see this year's cherry blossoms next year, after all.\r\nYukari: This is the only year you get to see them. Isn't that right.\r\nYomi: .........\r\nYume: ...Eh!! Yukari-sama! And Yomi onee-san too!\r\nYukari: I told the research institutions to make due with sending me a report. They're only looking to win my favor, after all.\r\nYomi: Yes, compared to this, those inspections would be a waste of time.\r\nYume: Whoa... Everyone's here...! I wanted to see the cherry blossoms with all of you!\r\nMaki: But, acting on your own without permission, sortieing alone, is nothing to be proud of.\r\nMaki: Yume, you're the ace up our sleeve. But that means you have to actually be up our sleeve. If you go running off on your own, it'll cause problems.\r\nYume: I understand...\r\nSuzuka: My, you're being rather respectable today, Yume.\r\nYume: Well, everyone made it, so for today I feel like doing what I'm told!\r\nMaki: The \"for today\" part bothers me, but so long as you get it then that's enough... And on that note.\r\nMaki: Fourth seat of the elite guard, Tsubakuro Yume. For sortieing without permission twice, I will now announce your punishment.\r\nSuzuka: And since it's twice, expect a strict punishment.\r\nYume: Ehh~! ...Or that's how I'd normally feel. But I don't feel like getting upset about it today, so go ahead!\r\nMaki: Then, Tsubakuro Yume. As punishment, you are hereby ordered to act as escort for Yukari-sama, as well as the three members of the elite guard; Shidou Maki, Konohana Suzuka, and Satsuki Yomi...\r\nMaki: In their inspection of the deciduous trees of the Rosaceae family, from the Amygdaloideae sub-family, in the Prunus genus, the Yoshino Cherry~!\r\nMaki: A fitting punishment, don't you think, Yukari-sama?\r\nYukari: Fu... Indeed.\r\nSuzuka: Such a strict punishment. I can hardly believe it.\r\nYume: Deciduous, rosaceae...? Huh...?\r\nMaki: You're not the brightest, you know.\r\nYomi: You have to view the cherry blossoms with us, is what she means.\r\nYume: Ohh, okay. Yeah... Yeah! I'll be the best escort you've ever seen!\r\nYume: I'll get rid of any aradama that show up before you know it! Count on it! I won't let anyone get in your way!\r\nYume: (I hope... That we can all see the cherry blossoms together again next year, just like this.)"}, {"paste_key": "C2quax2R", "title": "Ninja War Under the Moonlight", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/C2quax2R", "timestamp": "", "hits": "67", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55feUw3Eyvw\r\n\r\n1: Ninja War Outbreak: Steal the Secret Letter\r\n\r\nHamatsuka Sakura: M-M-M-Makizou-sama, Suzusuke-sama, s-something terrible... Something terrible has happened!!\r\nMaki: Get a hold of yourself! As ninja in the service of Yukari-sama, we Origami ninja must always be calm and collected.\r\nSakura: I-I'm... Very sorry...\r\nSuzuka: Now then, what happened?\r\nSakura: That's, ninja from another territory seem to have infiltrated our ninja mansion. Their target is likely...\r\nSakura: That \"secret letter\", I believe.\r\nMaki: What are the guards doing, allowing the enemy to slip through? If they're that negligent, I'll have to re-discipline them later.\r\nSuzuka: However, Makizou-dono, we do have a bit of spare time. A round of rat hunting might be amusing.\r\nMaki: A rat hunt...? You may be on to something, Suzusuke-dono.\r\nMaki: If they're skilled enough to invade here, they may prove useful in killing time... We'll see.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the other side--\r\n\r\nKofuki: Damnit, why do I have to play along with this dumb stuff? What moron came up with \"Mokusa ninja\"!\r\nKiyoka: P-Please calm down, Kofukimaru-san. If you make too much noise, the enemy will find us.\r\nKofuki: And who do you think you're calling Kofukimaru?\r\nKiyoka: Please calm down, that's just how it is. We've come this far, so please give up and accept it.\r\nKofuki: I'm no good at giving up!\r\nKofuki: Anyway, you're acting pretty weird. Can't believe you actually volunteered for this stupid job.\r\nKiyoka: Ehh~, it seemed like a lot of fun.\r\nKofuki: No good... You and I are on totally different channels. I'm not into this kind of game.\r\nKofuki: And since I'm not into it, can I drop the act and just call it quits here?\r\nKiyoka: You can't do that. We're not allowed to go back until the mission is over, Shichinosato-san. Ahh, I didn't mean that! ...Kofukimaru-san!\r\nKofuki: Ugh, well whatever... Let's get this bad joke over with already. So, what's this thing we're after again?\r\nKiyoka: Within this mansion, there lies a certain secret message. We need to steal it and escape the village.\r\nKofuki: Right, great... So what the hell is \"a certain secret message\"? What \"village\"?\r\nKiyoka: The secret message is a secret message. The village is a village. Please don't try to poke holes in the setting.\r\nKofuki: Poke holes!? Between the secret message and the village, there's more holes than setting!\r\nKofuki: I guess it doesn't matter... I just have to play along. Let's hurry and get this over with!\r\n\r\nOnce again, on the other side--\r\n\r\nMaki: There you are! Skulking around in a place like this; you truly are rats!\r\nNagasaki Sumi: Ahh, we're not rats, we're ninja...\r\nMaruyama Akane: That's right! We're ninja, so of course we're gonna hide!\r\nAkane: A ninja without the nin is just a ja! [ninja is made up the kanji nin, to hide, and ja, person]\r\nMai: Still, to be discovered so quickly... We can't take the Origami ninja lightly.\r\nMaki: In the first place, you're all disorganized.\r\nMaki: What a shame... At this rate, our fun will be over all too soon.\r\nAkane: Hey-! We Mokusa ninja've been training our bodies hard! You'll regret looking down on us!\r\nSumi: Ah... We were trying to stay undercover... Why did you say who we are...?\r\nAkane: Ah- No wayyy! You tricked me! That's playing dirty!\r\nSuzuka: I don't believe it; you actually revealed your own identity... Even disorganized was giving you too much credit. Please try not to disappoint us any further.\r\nMai: We have no obligation to meet your expectations, but we can't continue like we planned. Everyone, get ready!\r\nSumi: Right!\r\nAkane: I'll follow your lead!\r\nSuzuka: ...Well, self-proclaimed Mokusa ninja, could you please entertain us for a while?\r\nMaki: You came all this way to face defeat!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Difference in Daily Training Shown Through Defeat\r\n\r\nAkane: Ninja Art: Deadlift Technique!!\r\nMaki: I can see right through it!\r\nMaki: HNPH-!!\r\nAkane: Gahhh! So... Heavy... How can one strike be that heavy!?\r\nMaki: Oh...? You were able to block that? Though if you don't put your hips into it, you'll be split in two.\r\nAkane: Easy for you to say, but I'm overworked here...!\r\nAkane: For me to get overpowered like this... No way... You're so tough... What routine did you do to get like this?\r\nMaki: I'll tell you... First, a light run of about 40km. Follow that with fingertip push ups, sit ups, lat pulldowns, squat hops, lateral crossovers, and pull ups. That's 500 repetitions of each.\r\nMaki: Then 200 curls with a 40kg weight in each hand. Next, with an axe, I chop 1,000 pieces of firewood, followed by 2,000 practice swings with my sword.\r\nMaki: Now a run up a flight of 200 stone steps, 20 times. Then a 20km swim against the waves. Finally, two sparring sessions to finish it off.\r\nMaki: Take a good cleansing bath to relax your muscles, and eat a lot of nutritious food. That's all.\r\nAkane: That's all...! Your routine's insane...!\r\nSuzuka: If she's off duty that day, she'll do it all twice...\r\nSuzuka: Or at least, that's the character she's playing.\r\nAkane: Character!? I thought you were serious, you got me~!\r\nMaki: Don't break character, Suzuka. You ruined such a perfect mood!\r\nSuzuka: It could cause trouble if she actually believed you. Not to mention, I didn't think you'd get so carried away...\r\nMaki: Anyway, with the rigorous training I go through every day, my strength has no equal!\r\nMaki: And here's proof! Origami Ninja Art: Great Tornado Whirlwind Cutter!!\r\nMai: This... Sword pressure... Kyaaaaa!!\r\nAkane: Gyaaaah~ I'm beaaaaat~... Thud...!!\r\nSumi: Th-Thud...!\r\nMaki: In the end, you were no match for us Origami ninja. You need to show more dedication to your training.\r\nSuzuka: Sakurayoshi, please escort the captured Yanase Mai, Maruyama Akane, and Nagasaki Sumi to the dungeon.\r\nSakura: U-Understood!\r\nMaki: ...Still, it doesn't add up.\r\nSuzuka: What doesn't?\r\nMaki: Did Mokusa's leader really believe ninja of that caliber could steal the secret letter from our mansion?\r\nSuzuka: Perhaps... They lack the manpower for it?\r\nMaki: Perhaps. But it's too soon to grow complacent.\r\nMaki: Us undermining their plan could have been another part of their plan. Thinking along those lines--\r\nSuzuka: I see... These girls were a diversion. Their main force is sneaking in elsewhere.\r\nMaki: It's a reasonable assumption.\r\nSuzuka: Then, let us hunt down this main force. Maybe they can prove more entertaining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: That's a Promise\r\n\r\nKiyoka: I see why they call this the impregnable ninja mansion of the Origami ninja. We'll have to move cautiously through here.\r\nKiyoka: Of course there's hidden pitfalls... But then there's this kind of trap and that kind of trap. Not to mention, I didn't even think they could prepare a trap like that one! Very impressive.\r\nKofuki: This kind of trap and that kind of trap? What kind of trap?\r\nKiyoka: Y-You know... An amazing trap that would make you shout \"AHH!\" if you sprung it...\r\nKofuki: I hate to rain on your parade, but there's no traps anywhere in here, you know?\r\nKiyoka: Well~, what about a falling ceiling or a flooding room... It's more fun to pretend those kind of traps are there!\r\nKofuki: ...You're surprisingly into this stuff, huh, Kiyoka. Well, at least someone's having fun with it.\r\nKiyoka: Are you not having fun, Kofukimaru-san?\r\nKofuki: Do I look like I'm having fun? I keep telling you, let's just get this over with so we can go home already.\r\nKiyoka: For that, we need to locate their secret letter...\r\nKofuki: Yeah, I know. The problem is where are they keeping this secret whatever?\r\nKiyoka: According to the setting, the secret letter is extremely important, so they must be keeping it in the most secure part of the mansion.\r\nKiyoka: Looking at the structure of the building... Ah, I mean, considering the circumstances, I believe it's in the innermost room of the mansion.\r\nKofuki: Considering the circumstances, the innermost room, huh. You sure about that?\r\nKiyoka: In cases like this, that's a promise.\r\nKofuki: Promise, huh... So you've really got no idea.\r\nKiyoka: Let's head deeper in at least. The secret letter is sure to be there, I know it... Considering the circumstances.\r\nKofuki: Considering the circumstances, huh... But before that, we've got guests.\r\nKiyoka: Guests?\r\nAradama: KIKIKIGIGIGIGIGIGI...\r\nKiyoka: Aradama!? No way, why!?\r\nKofuki: Who cares why? They showed up at the best possible time!\r\nKofuki: I was about to die from boredom! I love you! My aradama-chan!\r\n\r\nKofuki: Mmmm~ I feel great! Aradama-chan's the best after all!\r\nKiyoka: Using aradama is going too far! I never heard anything about this.\r\nKiyoka: Do the defenders want to win that badly? In that case, this should count as a foul... Actually, it should be an out.\r\nKiyoka: Since it's come to this, we can't afford to lose either. We have to defeat the evil deputies, and bring peace back to the land!\r\nKofuki: No, there's no evil deputies! And the game's rules didn't say anything about peace; we've just gotta bring back the secret letter.\r\nKiyoka: .........! Ah, that's right!\r\nKofuki: Don't give me that. Just how carried away with this game are you gonna get? And anyway, about those aradama.\r\nKofuki: They didn't come from the other team. They must have just showed up on their own.\r\nKiyoka: They did!?\r\nKofuki: No matter how bad they want to win, nobody's gonna use aradama for this dumbass make believe exercise!\r\nKofuki: .........They wouldn't, right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: After a Furious Finish, Farewell, Ninja Mansion\r\n\r\nKiyoka: ...Kofukimaru-san. It seems we've reached the mansion's innermost room. That secret letter is sure to be here...\r\nKofuki: It was surprisingly easy finding this place.\r\nSuzuka: Fufufufufu... Of course it was.\r\nSuzuka: After all, we wanted to guide you here.\r\nKiyoka: The Origami ninja, they found us!?\r\nMaki: Suspecting nothing, you happily wandered right into our ambush.\r\nMaki: There's nowhere left to run or hide. At last you realize, you're nothing but trapped rats.\r\nKofuki: Trapped rats, or wolves in sheep's clothing? Doesn't matter. Either way, we're gonna lay you flat here.\r\nMaki: Oh? At least your tongue is sharp, if nothing else.\r\nKofuki: You'll find out how sharp the rest is, once we beat you.\r\nMaki: You're not too bad at this.\r\nKiyoka: More importantly... Where's the secret letter?\r\nSuzuka: If that's what you're after, Sakurayoshi is guarding it there.\r\nKiyoka: That's...\r\nMaki: I'll handle our foes. Sakurayoshi, in the meantime, keep the secret letter safe!\r\nSakura: U-U-U-U-Understood! Ahh- Kyaah!!\r\nSuzuka: What are you doing, Sakurayoshi! Hurry and escape with the secret letter!\r\nSakura: Ah, owwwww... I fell over, I think I cracked my butt...\r\nMaki: It was cracked from the beginning! Hurry! Escape! Protect the secret letter!\r\nSakura: I'm sorry... B-But it hurts... Ughh, I can't stand up...\r\nMaki: Absolutely pathetic... You call yourself an Origami ninja!?\r\nSakura: Ah... I'm sorry...\r\nSuzuka: Makizou-dono, don't be so hard on her. Not everyone who gathered here is a toji like us. She's only a researcher from the medical department.\r\nMaki: ...Have you forgotten, Suzusuke? Right now, we're all ninja! Nothing more, nothing less.\r\nMaki: \"Toji\", \"researchers\", words like those which break this world have no place here!\r\nSuzuka: I understand that, but... I didn't think you'd be so obsessive about it. In a way, I'm impressed!\r\nKiyoka: You let your guard down! I'll be taking the secret letter now!\r\nMaki: Damn! Run, Sakurayoshi!!\r\nSakura: Ahhh~~!! My butt! My butt still hurts...!\r\n\r\nAnnouncer: Time is up. Time is up. The invading team could not complete their objective within the time limit. Therefore, the defending team wins.\r\nAnnouncer: I repeat: Time is up. Time is up. The invading team could not complete their objective within the time limit. Therefore, the defending team wins.\r\nAnnouncer: Good work out there, everyone. With this, the special training course \"Ninja Mansion\" is concluded.\r\nMaki: Phew~ We were in a pinch, but it's our victory.\r\nSuzuka: That was a close one, to be sure.\r\nKiyoka: Ahhh~, we lost...\r\nKofuki: I couldn't care less about this training, but losing's still frustrating.\r\nKiyoka: You say that, but I think you were enjoying it by the end, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: Tch, I wasn't really enjoying it.\r\nSakura: W-Well I enjoyed it! Usually I'm too busy with research to get out much, so... I had fun!\r\nMaki: Don't be mistaken, this wasn't a game. It's still practice. A part of our training.\r\nSuzuka: There's nothing wrong with enjoying your training though, isn't that right, \"Makizou-dono\"?\r\nKofuki: Aghh~ If only we'd had a few more seconds!\r\nSumi: I'm jealous you all got to participate till the end...\r\nAkane: I know, they just scooped us up and locked us away! I thought we'd get to do more!\r\nMai: Let's learn from our mistakes next time.\r\nMaki: We aren't about to lose next time either.\r\nKofuki: Next time...? You can't be serious. If you're gonna do it, have fun without me.\r\nMaki: What are you saying, Shichinosato Kofuki? You don't mean you're quitting here, do you?\r\nKofuki: Huhh? You're the one talking crazy. Of course I'm not sticking around!\r\nSuzuka: Oh my. It seems that no one explained in detail to you.\r\nKofuki: About what?\r\nMaki: The foundation of this project is role-playing. Along with the victory condition, it's important that you're able to adapt to your role.\r\nMaki: This program serves as training for your ability to carry out whatever role you're given.\r\nMaki: It goes without saying that a team of toji working together need to trust each other to cooperate. Acting according to your private interests is forbidden.\r\nSuzuka: And in your case, Shichinosato-san. With your complete lack of cooperation, we were asked by Kitora Mirja-san to train you thoroughly.\r\nMaki: Don't think you'll get to leave until after we finish all seven more sets.\r\nKofuki: Huuuhhhh~~~~~~!? Seven sets!?\r\nAnnouncer: In a moment, the next training course will begin. The name of the program is \"The Queen and the Great Thieves\". Details of the mission are as follows--\r\nKofuki: LET ME OUT OF HERE ALREADYYY!!"}, {"paste_key": "V9ALBQqa", "title": "2 - The Darkness Looming over the World", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/V9ALBQqa", "timestamp": "", "hits": "143", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=495_udOh8hI\r\n\r\n1: Harajuku Revisited (1)\r\n\r\nMirja: We've reached Meiji Shrine. It won't be long now before we arrive at Aoto-kan.\r\nMihono: I still can't believe it. I never would have guessed Youji-san was helping Mokusa like Chii-nee.\r\nMihono: If that's how it was, you should have just told us when we went there the first time.\r\nKiyoka: Their organization is supposed to be a secret, so I don't think they could have...\r\nMihono: Ahh- Oh yeah! It was, wasn't it? Ahaha.\r\nChie: Aren't you upset about it, Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan? After I lied to you and used you.\r\nMihono: ...Hmm~, I don't feel mad about it though?\r\nChie: ...Why not?\r\nMihono: Why not...? Well I never even noticed, so I wouldn't have found out unless you told me.\r\nMihono: Wouldn't it be weirder if I got mad about something I didn't know? In fact, it's more like I think it's pretty cool how you managed to keep all that a secret, Chii-nee~.\r\nKiyoka: As for me... I know you're a good person, Setouchi-san. If someone like you has to tell a lie, I'm sure you're doing it for a good reason...\r\nKiyoka: That's why I won't really... I won't hold it against you!\r\nChie: And what if being a good person was just another part of my act?\r\nKiyoka: Even then, I wouldn't mind... Even if you were acting, the fact remains that you were so kind to me... That's enough for me.\r\nChie: You two... Thanks.\r\nMihono: C'mon, quit worrying about it already! You're such a downer, Chii-nee~. Besides, everyone's got a secret or two they haven't told anybody, right?\r\nMihono: Like, don't tell her, but my stomach was rumbling earlier and I couldn't help myself, so I ate Fukki's pudding.\r\nKofuki: Ohhh~? So you were behind that, huh?\r\nMihono: Geh, Fukki-!? You heard that!?\r\nKofuki: \"Geh... You heard that\", so that's how it is now!?\r\nKofuki: When I asked you about it before, you said you had no clue what happened to my pudding. Why didn't you say something? Why the hell didn't you say something~?\r\nMihono: I-I tried to tell you! But you looked like you were about to stab someone! Your eyes were really scary, so I just...\r\nKofuki: Well course I did. When you steal the pudding somebody was really looking forward to, you should expect to get what's coming to you!\r\nMihono: I-I'm so sorry! I'll buy you two puddings as payback, so forgive me!\r\nKofuki: Three. If that's too much, then we can do this the really hard way.\r\nMihono: Ughh~... Fine... If that gets me off the hook... I'll buy you three puddings.\r\nKofuki: Heh, you get to live another day. And make sure you don't forget this one. People hold serious grudges when you eat what's theirs!\r\nMihono: G-Got iiit...\r\n\r\nMihono: Aghh~... Talk about false charges.\r\nKiyoka: I don't think you get to call that false charges, Hono-chan.\r\nMihono: Ch-Changing the subject! When we were here last time, it was pretty crazy with all the aradama around, wasn't it!\r\n*aradama appears*\r\nMihono: Yeah, just like that- Whoa, it's happening again!!\r\nKiyoka: I-It's because you had to go and bring it up, Hono-chan...\r\nMihono: Eh!? This is my fault now!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Harajuku Revisited (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Why does this have to keep happening when we're in such a rush...\r\nKofuki: Well I've always got time for aradama-chan! Hehaha!\r\nMirja: We're losing too much time to these aradama. Let's pick up the pace to Aoto-kan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Feeling Rushed, Getting Impatient (1)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: I never would have thought we'd be fighting aradama as soon as we arrived in Harajuku...\r\nMihono: Same here. I wish they'd do us a favor for once and leave us alone.\r\nKofuki: You said it.\r\nMihono: Huh? Am I hearing things!? You're always pumped up whenever there's a chance to fight aradama, so why not now?\r\nKofuki: It's hard to get into it when Chichie won't stop looking so depressing.\r\nChie: .........\r\nMihono: Chii-nee? Chii-nee!?\r\nChie: ...Eh? W-What is it? Sorry, I didn't hear you.\r\nMihono: It's nothing, just... Are you okay?\r\nChie: Mmhm... Of course.\r\nMirja: Are you now? Because it very much doesn't seem that way to me.\r\nMirja: Your reactions are more sluggish than ever before, on top of which you're having a hard time assessing the situation, paying attention to your surroundings, and listening to others.\r\nMirja: Do you realize how many times you've put yourself at risk while we've been fighting now? Thankfully, Asakura Mihono and Musumi Kiyoka have been there to cover for you.\r\nMirja: I understand that Mokusa is weighing on your mind, but it's inexcusable for you to ignore the situation at hand.\r\nMirja: Rather than helping, you're only a burden on us like this. Frankly, it would only save us trouble if you would stay out of the fighting.\r\nKiyoka: Th-That's going too far...\r\nChie: What's your prob--\r\nAradama: GYAAAUUUU!\r\nMihono: Ehh, there's more!?\r\nChie: One after another... We don't have time for this!\r\nMirja: Everyone, prepare for battle. Shichinosato Kofuki will attack the enemy from the front. Setouchi Chie and Musumi Kiyoka will support from the rear. Asakura Mihono and I will attack at their blind spots, until all of them are eliminated.\r\nChie: We need to finish this fast so I can find out what happened to the others. I'm joining the front!\r\nMirja: I hope you haven't forgotten, but I'm the captain of this investigation team.\r\nMirja: And, as captain, I'm rejecting that proposal. With the way you are now, you'd only be slowing us down unnecessarily.\r\nMirja: Musumi Kiyoka. Please make sure Setouchi Chie doesn't overwork herself.\r\nKiyoka: I-I'll try.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Feeling Rushed, Getting Impatient (2)\r\n\r\nMirja: Pant, pant, pant...\r\nKiyoka: M-Mirja-san, your arm is bleeding...\r\nMirja: It's nothing. It isn't deep enough to affect my ability to fight.\r\nKofuki: You overdid it. For all that lecturing you were giving Chichie, you're not acting like yourself either.\r\nMihono: Seriously. I had that sinking feeling in my stomach the whole time you kept pushing forward after your utsushi broke.\r\nMirja: I only did what I decided had to be done. We're in a race against time. We can't afford to be held back here.\r\nChie: ...You mean, you got hurt because of me?\r\nMirja: That isn't the case. I was only injured due to my own inexperience. I should be more dedicated to my training.\r\nChie: I'm sorry... About earlier.\r\nMirja: So long as you understand, that's enough.\r\nMirja: I'm aware you're feeling rushed, but because of that you were exposing all of us to danger. I know you don't want that either.\r\nMirja: Achieving our goal is meaningless if we can't reach it while guaranteeing everyone's safety.\r\nMirja: Naturally that means keeping you safe as well, Setouchi Chie.\r\nMirja: In the same way you are worried about Mokusa, I am worried about you.\r\nChie: Mirja-san... Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: What Happens Twice Will Happen Thrice (1)\r\n\r\nMirja: Now that we've all managed to catch our breath, let's--\r\nGirl: KYAAAAAAA!!\r\nKiyoka: Wh-What was that!? Eh... N-No way... More aradama...!? They're after her!\r\nMihono: You're kidding, aradama again!? They say what happens twice happens thrice, but now of all times... Come onnn~!\r\nKofuki: You guys go on ahead and leave this to me.\r\nMihono: This is a real emergency, you know! Don't try to look cool when you just want to play around, Fukki!\r\nKofuki: That's not it! I just wanna chop up aradama. You want to get there quick. So what's the problem here?\r\nMihono: There's no way you can fight of all those aradama by yourself!\r\nKofuki: Course I can. The more the merrier, actually!\r\nKofuki: Come on, get going already. You're holding up me and aradama-chan's private playtime!\r\nChie: Don't be ridiculous; we aren't leaving you alone here!\r\nKofuki: Do you hear yourself? You're the one who wants to leave the most, Chichie.\r\nKofuki: Besides, you're totally useless right now. Get outta here before you get hurt.\r\nChie: Don't worry... I won't be a burden on you anymore.\r\nMirja: It seems you've regained your composure at least.\r\nMirja: Honestly, I'm still feeling impatient. I want to get out of here as fast as I can.\r\nChie: And that's why we'll defeat these aradama right away. Mirja-san, will you support me?\r\nMirja: Certainly. That's my role here after all.\r\nMihono: Alright~! Let's take them down together!\r\nKiyoka: That's how it is... It'll be over faster if we all work as a team.\r\nKofuki: What, all of you are staying? Tch... No helping it, huh!\r\nChie: Then, let's go!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: What Happens Twice Will Happen Thrice (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Ughh~, that's gotta be all the aradama around here, right?\r\nKiyoka: If more showed up... I don't think we can beat them...\r\nKofuki: You guys are pathetic. I could go like seven more times! No, maybe more than that!\r\nChie: That's a little overboard, don't you think...\r\nMirja: At any rate, this frequent series of aradama attacks is highly unusual.\r\nChie: Yes... Something's really wrong about all this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: At the End of a Long Journey (1)\r\n\r\nAoto Youji: Come right in-- Oh, long time no see, ladies. Miss me so much you just had to come back, huh? Popular guys have it so hard.\r\nMirja: Sorry to stop by unannounced.\r\nYouji: Did you get prettier in the short time since I last saw you all?\r\nYouji: They say boys can change a lot if you take your eyes off them for three days, but I guess the same goes for girls too.\r\nYouji: So, jokes aside, what brings you here today? You're welcome for help with anything besides the blades.\r\nChie: We don't need help with anything today; we're here about Mok--\r\n???: Ah-! Look at all the cuties who came in! Would you by any chance be the investigation team!?\r\nChie: We are, but... Who are you?\r\n???: I knew it! When I saw all your uniforms were different, it was like a lightbulb went off in my head!\r\n???: Ahhh~... You're all so cute though! Just looking at you, I can't help but sigh! I just want to give you all a big hug!\r\n???: Ohh, oh yeah, I should introduce myself first!\r\nYui: Second year middle schooler from Ayanokouji, Yamashiro Yui. I've been assigned by President Souraku to join your investigation team!\r\nMirja: By President Souraku?\r\nYui: Yep, yep. I was following in your footsteps and just got here. But who'd have thought I'd meet you this soon? I'm so lucky-!\r\nYui: President Souraku told me to follow your instructions, Mirja-san! I've got a good idea of the situation already, so please order me to do whatever you want!\r\nMirja: To be more specific, what's your understanding of our situation?\r\nYui: Let's see~... President Souraku and this Mokusa organization started working together for some goal... Which one of you's Setouchi-san?\r\nChie: That would be me.\r\nYui: Ahhh~... That beautiful older girl vibe is just dreamy! But, leaving that aside for now, I know you're a member of Mokusa too.\r\nMirja: President Souraku knew about Mokusa? Come to think of it, she did speak with President Maniwa...\r\nMirja: But even we only recently learned Setouchi Chie was a member of Mokusa. How did you find out? Did President Souraku tell you that as well?\r\nYouji: Well, that'd be because I told her. We've been talking about all kinds of things.\r\nYouji: You thought it was a good time to tell your friends the truth too, didn't you? It's like that.\r\nChie: ...I understand. If that's what you decided, then I won't question it.\r\nChie: Anyway, the reason we came here was to--\r\nYouji: Ah, I know. I know was goofing around earlier, but now's not the time for that. It's about Mokusa, isn't it?\r\nYouji: Actually--\r\nAradama: GUGIGGYAAAAAAAA!!\r\nKiyoka: That roar...\r\nMihono: Aradama!? I thought for sure we'd finally get a break!?\r\nKofuki: What're you saying, they came all this way for us. We've gotta roll out the red carpet!\r\nKofuki: You wanted to play with me that bad? I love you too! My aradama-chan!\r\nYui: This is my big chance to show off what I can do! I'm going on ahead, everyone!\r\nKofuki: That jackass; you don't get to steal a headstart on me like that-!\r\n\r\nYui: URYAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nKiyoka: That girl's... Strong...\r\nMirja: It seems there's good reason she was the only one chosen to be our backup. She may be lacking in speed, but makes up for it with heavy strikes that accurately find her target one after another.\r\nMirja: On top of that, no matter how heavy her swings, she never shifts her position. I have no doubt she possesses excellent core strength.\r\nKofuki: Now's not the time for admiring! Quit stealing all my fuuun-!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: At the End of a Long Journey  (2)\r\n\r\nYui: Phew~, all done, all done. Did you get to see some of my cool side?\r\nMihono: You're so strong, Yamashiro-san! Ah... I'm Asakura Mihono! You can just call me Mihono.\r\nYui: Ahaha, thanks, Mihono-chan! It's a little embarrassing, getting called strong...\r\nMihono: Hey, want to have a practice match with me later?\r\nYui: Of course, I'd be delighted to! I'd go along with any request from a cutie like you.\r\nAoto Hina: All of you, something big's happening! Come inside and see!!\r\n\r\nMihono: What's up?\r\nChie: Something big at a time like this...? It can't be anything good...\r\nHina: The TV, the TV! Just look at the TV!!\r\nMihono: TV?\r\nNewscaster: --Under suspicions of large-scale involvement with terrorism, police in each prefecture have launched a forced investigation into Osafune and Minoseki of The Five Traditions.\r\nNewscaster: According to the authorities, it seems both schools were forming combat units using toji to promote acts of terrorism.\r\nNewscaster: Several officials involved with the schools have been taken into police custody, and further investigation now is underway.\r\nNewscaster: Currently, police are searching for the whereabouts of a female suspect with close ties to the Origami family, who is believed to be deeply involved with this incident.\r\nChie: What's... How...?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: The Truth Revealed\r\n\r\n--Shortly after the news broadcast about the forced investigation into Osafune Girls' Academy and Minoseki Academy.\r\n\r\nMirja: ...It's safe to assume this investigation means the head of the family has become aware of Mokusa's activities.\r\nYouji: I can't get in touch with Mokusa's headquarters either. Considering they put this on the news, odds are high they already took the place by force.\r\nMirja: You mean... Mokusa... Is already destroyed?\r\nYouji: I don't know about that. It'd be nice if Akane-sama got away at least.\r\nMirja: Akane-sama? Would that be the leader of Mokusa?\r\nYouji: Akane-sama, being Origami Yukari's younger sister, is the greatest ace up our sleeve.\r\nKiyoka: The sister of the head of the family? Even though they're sisters... She's working against her?\r\nYouji: Ever since she realized Yukari-sama became a different person after that day twenty years ago. And I mean that literally.\r\nMirja: Twenty Years ago? Twenty years ago was... You mean The Great Disaster?\r\nYouji: Yeah... The one that left 1,089 dead, 864 missing, and more injured than anyone's sure of. That unprecedented disaster.\r\nYouji: Seventeen years old at the time, Yukari-sama was the one who went and suppressed the great aradama at the source of it.\r\nYouji: Or rather, she's said to have suppressed it.\r\nMihono: Said to have...? You mean she didn't actually do it?\r\nYouji: That great aradama remains undefeated. It hid itself away and survived all these twenty years. Hid itself, as Yukari-sama.\r\nMirja: That's absurd... Are you saying the head of the family is that great aradama?\r\nYouji: I know you won't believe it so easy, but it's no lie.\r\nMirja: It sounds impossible, but it would help to explain the elite guards taking noro into their bodies...\r\nMirja: But, for the head of us toji to have been an aradama... What have we been doing all this time--\r\n\r\nAll Toji: !!\r\n\r\nMihono: What... Was that...? Did you all feel it too?\r\nChie: Yes... I had this uncomfortable sensation like my body was slipping out in front of me...\r\nMirja: I felt it too. I panicked and turned around in time to see a glimpse of myself behind me.\r\nKofuki: You too, huh... What the hell was that about?\r\nYouji: I've heard of this phenomenon before. From the old hands in Mokusa. Twenty years ago, right before the disaster, they felt the same thing.\r\nYouji: Without Mokusa to get in her way anymore, who knows what Origami Yukari's planning on doing next. I don't really want to picture it.\r\nMihono: You mean a repeat of The Great Disaster... Could happen? ...If Yukari-sama's really the great aradama, then we have to do something to stop it!\r\nYouji: Hate to say it, but that's out of the question. A great aradama can't be defeated by any normal means.\r\nYouji: Don't go thinking this is anything like the aradama you ladies have fought up till this point.\r\nKiyoka: Then... There's no way to stop it?\r\nYouji: No, there's one thing. A secret technique to suppress great aradama the Origami family's been passing down for generations. If we could try that...\r\nYouji: But saying that, it's not like I've got a clue what that technique's about. So there's nothing you ladies can do about it. As frustrating as that is.\r\nMirja: I see... That's why you called Origami Akane-sama the greatest ace up your sleeve. Akane-sama is the only one aware of how to perform that technique.\r\nYouji: If you charged in there without a plan, you'd all be throwing your lives away.\r\nMihono: But...!\r\n\r\nShortly after the mysterious phenomenon occurred--\r\n\r\nMihono: ...Is there really... Nothing we can do...?\r\nYouji: Oi! Ladies! I got in touch with Akane-sama, who managed to escape!\r\nYouji: She says they're soon going to launch a surprise attack using the few toji she has with her!\r\nKiyoka: But they're up against the head of the family... And the elite guard too... A few toji aren't going to be able to do anything...\r\nYouji: It's not just any toji. They've got the daughters of Fujiwara Minato and Hiiragi Kagari there, the ones who fought the great aradama with Yukari-sama all those years ago.\r\nMirja: I don't remember those names among the ones who defeated the great aradama alongside the head of the family though?\r\nYouji: They were there, trust me. History might've forgotten them, but they were the real heroes back then.\r\nYui: The descendants of those heroes became toji, huh...? If they're that great, I've probably heard their names at least?\r\nYouji: The first one's Juujou Hiyori. And the other's a little lady by the name of Etou Kanami, apparently.\r\nMihono: Eh- Kanami!? The same Kanami that attacked the head of the family!?\r\nChie: No matter how impressive they are, it won't be that easy... They aren't just up against the head of the family and her elite guard.\r\nChie: She'll have countless toji protecting her. Just reaching her will be almost impossible.\r\nYouji: They've got a plan for that too. Any hour now, Akane-sama will show herself before the general public and tell them the truth. They'll all know what the head of the family is and what she's up to.\r\nMirja: Doing that would only be revealing herself to the enemy. What does she hope to--\r\nMirja: No... I see... That's what she's after... I'm convinced then.\r\nYui: Umm... I still don't follow though. What's going on?\r\nMirja: To our enemy, Origami Akane-sama is something they can't ignore and will do everything to capture.\r\nMirja: Even if they suspect a trap, if Akane-sama reveals herself, they'll have no choice but to act.\r\nMirja: Even more so after letting her escape once. They'll send a considerable amount of people to ensure her capture.\r\nKofuki: I get it, that way everyone's drawn away from her hideout.\r\nChie: Even so, there's still going to be a severe number of toji waiting for that small group.\r\nYui: And any toji assigned to guard the head of the family is bound to be pretty tough to get through.\r\nMihono: ...I'm going to Kamakura too! I might not be able to fight the head of the family, but there has to be something I can do to help!\r\nMihono: And even if there isn't, I'm not about to sit quiet here!\r\nChie: I agree with Mihono-chan. Even if you try to stop me, I'm going. \r\nKofuki: All this waiting's getting boring anyway. Beats sitting around here, I guess.\r\nKiyoka: I-I'm going... With you...\r\nMihono: No one will blame you if you stay here, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: No, I'm going... Honestly, I'm so scared I can't stand it... But staying here waiting for all of you to come back sounds so much scarier...\r\nMirja: When it comes to all of you... There's no helping it, is there? As the one in charge of this team, I'll accompany you.\r\nYui: The president said to do whatever Mirja-san tells me, so I'm going too of course~!\r\nYouji: Ah man, what a bunch of unruly girls. Looks like I couldn't stop you if I tried.\r\nYouji: Then you'd better get going right away. If you don't make it before the surprise attack starts, you're not gonna be helping anybody.\r\nMihono: Alright, got it!\r\nMirja: Considering the distance, there's hardly enough time. I'll need each of you to travel faster than we've ever gone.\r\nMihono: Just hang in there, Kanami. We're coming to help!"}, {"paste_key": "YM9SVfGg", "title": "3 - Time Limit", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/YM9SVfGg", "timestamp": "", "hits": "106", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32B6iYjLJHE\r\n\r\n1: Clashing Thoughts and Feelings (1)\r\n\r\nChie: I won't forgive them... For what they did to everyone at Mokusa... I'll avenge them for sure...\r\nMirja: I understand how you feel, but please set your personal feelings aside. Anger will only cloud your thoughts and narrow your vision.\r\nMirja: If you can't maintain your composure, you won't be capable of your usual ability.\r\nChie: I know that... But, it's easier said than done...\r\nMihono: It's only natural. If Minoseki had been attacked and something awful happened to everyone, I know I'd feel the same way.\r\nMihono: Nobody's going to be okay with the people they care about getting hurt.\r\nMirja: I didn't say she had to be okay with it. I asked her to please keep her emotions under control.\r\nChie: And if it were that simple...\r\nMirja: If you can't do that, then you shouldn't go any further. Far from revenge, the most you'll accomplish is getting yourself killed.\r\nKiyoka: Mirja-san... How is it you can always be... So level headed?\r\nMirja: If I weren't, I would be unable to protect anyone. That goes for many people, of course, including all of you and myself.\r\nMihono: Mirja-san's already such an adult. You're so smart and self-controlled. I wish I could be like that.\r\nMihono: But that's impossible for me. Even when I know I shouldn't, I can't help but follow my heart...\r\nYui: Hey, c'mon-! Everyone just calm down! There's no point in arguing with each other now!\r\nYui: Your cute faces'll get stuck like that if you keep frowning! Cheer up! Smile! Let's get along!\r\nMirja: I am calm. I don't think we were arguing either. I was simply stating my mind.\r\nKofuki: Anyway, whatever happens, happens. Panicking's not gonna get us anywhere. You'll just tire yourselves out here.\r\nMihono: Aren't you panicking, Fukki? Things are getting crazy, and there's not a lot of time left.\r\nKofuki: I told you, whatever happens, happens. Or what, is panicking gonna make us come out the other side happily ever after? Course not. So why not take it easy?\r\nMihono: Take it easy... That doesn't sound like something you'd say... After all, you're always charging ahead.\r\nKiyoka: You're right...\r\nKofuki: Shuttup! Just quit getting all worked up, alright!\r\nYui: But are we even going to make it? Kamakura's still super far away.\r\nChie: We'll make it. No matter what happens, we'll make it.\r\nKiyoka: P-Please don't let anything happen...\r\nKofuki: Don't count on it. When it rains, it pours.\r\nAradama: KIKIKIGGIGIGIGIGIG...\r\nYui: Why can't life ever be easyyy! When they say god is dead, this is what they mean! But at least let there be a goddess out there!\r\nMirja: What should we do? If you don't want to waste a moment getting revenge, we could hurry on ahead and trust other toji will deal with this.\r\nYui: Eh? But then won't ordinary people get attacked? I don't want to see any girls getting hurt!\r\nChie: ...You don't have to be so harsh. You know I wouldn't do something that awful.\r\nMirja: I'm just relieved to see you haven't lost sight of your duty as a toji. Good then, let's quickly exterminate these aradama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Clashing Thoughts and Feelings (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Even if we'd had more time to fight them, those were some pretty tough aradama, right?\r\nYui: It's hard not to think they're trying to stop us from getting to Kamakura, you know?\r\nMirja: Unexpectedly, that may in fact be the case. However, even so, that doesn't mean we'll do as they please.\r\nMirja: By defeating all aradama we come across, we might at least throw off our enemy's plans.\r\nChie: Agreed. We won't let them get away with this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: As Toji (1)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Why do they have to keep delaying us at a time like this...\r\nChie: Even so, that doesn't mean we can ignore them. Regardless of how serious our mission is, there's nothing more important than protecting the people from aradama.\r\nChie: As toji, we were chosen by okatana for that purpose. It's frustrating, but... That's the one thing we can't forget.\r\nMihono: That's right... Good old Chii-nee; you said it!\r\nMirja: That said, we can't afford many more interruptions. All we can do is pray no more aradama appear.\r\nYui: But like they say, if you see one, expect thirty, right?\r\nKofuki: That's cockroaches! But I guess it's not really wrong here either.\r\nKiyoka: C-Cockroaches...? Ughhh~... Now I can't help but imagine them... My spine's tingling... So gross...\r\nYui: Ahhn~, sorry, Kiyoka-chan! At times like this, you should just think of something fun!\r\nKiyoka: Something fun... Something fun... When this mission's over, I want to eat crepes in Harajuku... I guess...?\r\nYui: Nice, nice~ It's so girly! And I'll go with you. Let's have a crepe party!\r\nYui: Still though, isn't what you just said a pretty serious flag?\r\nMihono: What's a flag?\u3000Anyway, we need to keep going--\r\nAradama: GUKIIKIKIGIGIGIIGI...\r\nMihono: Uwah, more of them!!\r\nYui: Ahaha, it was a flag alright! Ah, Mihono-chan, that's what a flag means. Like when something gives you a bad feeling and then it happens?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: As Toji (2)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Sigh~... I think there actually might have been thirty of them...\r\nKofuki: We're seriously running short on time now... If these keeps up, we're not gonna make it, are we?\r\nMihono: Don't worry, we'll definitely make it!!\r\nKofuki: We will...? Do you know something I don't?\r\nMihono: I do!\r\nMirja: I'm interested too. Please tell us.\r\nMihono: If you give up, then it's all over. But so long as you keep trying, the chances are always greater than 0%! That's why.\r\nKiyoka: That's... Not exactly a reason, Hono-chan...\r\nMirja: That's putting it lightly... Though, there is some logic to it.\r\nMirja: If we resign ourselves to not making it, all our paths will close off. To prevent that from happening, we need to devote ourselves fully to all we can do right now.\r\nChie: Yes, that's right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: All We Can Do (1)\r\n\r\nYui: Nnnnnnghhhnnnhn~~~~~!\r\nKofuki: Shut up, what're you moaning about? You're bringing the mood down, so keep quiet already.\r\nMihono: Does your stomach hurt? Do you need to go to the bathroom? There's probably a convenience store nearby.\r\nYui: Nah, that's not it... Can I ask a question real quick?\r\nMihono: Sure, what?\r\nYui: I'm cool with going to the Origami estate and all, but what are we going to do when we get there? I've been wondering that.\r\nYui: Are we all supposed to fight the head of the family together?\r\nYui: But I don't know how we can beat her, and if Mokusa has a plan, then what if we're just getting in their way?\r\nMihono: Now that you mention it, I got so carried away I never thought about what we were going to do when we get there!\r\nKiyoka: Well... Aren't we going to support them?\r\nKofuki: By doing what, exactly?\r\nKiyoka: Like, um... Cheering them on...?\r\nMihono: We can get them food! You can't fight on an empty stomach, after all!\r\nKofuki: Great idea! Nobody likes fighting when they're hungry! Maybe we could find a place to pick up some stamina loaded bentos--\r\nKofuki: --Or maybe we could find a place to get your head checked!\r\nYui: Nice comeback!\r\nKofuki: Damnit... I already learned not to expect anything from Mihocchi, but not you too, Kiyoka... Cheer them on, seriously?\r\nKofuki: You've been spending too much time together. Maybe you caught her Mihocchitis?\r\nKiyoka: That's rude. I'm not as bad as Hono-chan...\r\nMihono: Hm...? Am I imagining things, or is what you just said way ruder? --Well, whatever!\r\nChie: ...You're just going to let that pass?\r\nMihono: If that's how you're gonna be, Fukki, then let's see you come up with something everyone agrees with!\r\nKofuki: I'm just the muscle. Mirja's the brains here, right?\r\nMihono: Ahh, you just weaseled out of it and pushed it on someone else! Play fair, Fukki!\r\nKofuki: I wasn't weaseling! And there's nothing unfair about it!\r\nMihono: Well, can you tell us what you're thinking, Mirja-san?\r\nMirja: I don't mind sharing, of course, but first we should deal with the enemies in our way.\r\nAradama: GUKIIKIKIKIGGIGIGI...\r\nKiyoka: Th-They're here again...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: All We Can Do (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: So then, what should we be doing?\r\nMirja: That would be as you've seen just now, with these aradama.\r\nMirja: As we push further in to join with Mokusa, more of them will move to stop us. The forces they've gathered will now be split.\r\nChie: Oh, a diversion strategy, right?\r\nMirja: Yes. We'll try to get their attention as much as possible, and they'll concentrate their strength on us.\r\nMirja: Those from Mokusa should face less needless conflict while infiltrating, and the chances of their success should rise significantly.\r\nKofuki: So basically, we're the bait.\r\nMihono: A diversion strategy... Okay! If it helps Kanami, I'll cause them all kinds of trouble!\r\nMihono: See, there's something we can do after all! Where there's a will, there's a way, guys!\r\nEveryone: Yeah!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: In the Nick of Time\r\n\r\nMihono: We're finally in Kamakura. Did we make it...? We're not too late, right?\r\nMirja: The Origami estate is just ahead. All we can do is have faith and keep going.\r\nYui: Ah... Hang on, everyone! Isn't this Mokusa?\r\nChie: What? What are you talking about?\r\nYui: I checked my phone while we stopped just now, and-- Just look at this video, it's a live broadcast!\r\nReporter: The mysterious submarine that suddenly appeared in the Port of Yokosuka has declared they have an urgent announcement to make, but as of yet, have taken no action.\r\nReporter: There is currently a state of confusion, while various theories are being speculated as to what their intent is and what this urgent announcement could be.\r\nReporter: We will remain here commenting on the scene as the military--\r\nChie: No doubt about it, that's Mokusa's sub. Thank goodness, it seems like we made it in time... I really wasn't sure if we would.\r\nKiyoka: It's actually going to happen... I'm so nervous my hands won't stop shaking...\r\nKofuki: That's not gonna make things any easier. Just loosen up.\r\nKiyoka: You say that, but... Uuuu~...\r\nMihono: When you're nervous, just write \"people\" on the palm of your hand, swallow it, and that's sure to calm you down!\r\nKiyoka: I already swallowed it... I lost count how many times... Maybe more than fifty by now...\r\nMihono: Already tried it, huh-! Well, I'm out of ideas.\r\nKiyoka: That's your only tip!?\r\nKofuki: Just don't worry about it.\r\nKiyoka: Ehhhh~~!?\r\nYui: It's okay! I know just the thing! It comes with a 100% guarantee to make you feel all better!\r\nKiyoka: Wh-What should I do?\r\nYui: Human contact has been proven to help relax! So~ that's~ why~, when you're feeling nervous, a hug's all you need! Come on, Kiyoka-chan!\r\nKiyoka: Ahaha... Maybe there's another way...\r\nChie: Other than Kiyoka, you all seem pretty relaxed, actually.\r\nMihono: I was feeling anxious before, but now's the time to get it together, right?\r\nMirja: Then, let's go, to the Origami estate.\r\nMihono: Yeah!"}, {"paste_key": "VL1j7dAY", "title": "Team vs Team in the White Day Wars", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/VL1j7dAY", "timestamp": "", "hits": "152", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "1: White Day Wars, Commence\r\n\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan, did you hear!? There's a team event starting! They're calling it the White Day Wars!\r\nKanami: For some reason, they found aradama carrying candies and marshmallows. So they put together a competition to defeat and collect them!\r\nMihono: I just found out about it myself! They said we can form our own teams with anyone from any school, and whoever gets the most sweets wins.\r\nMihono: And, more importantly, the winning team gets some kind of awesome secret prize!\r\nKanami: Even if we're not directly competing, it still sounds pretty fun! So, want to team up, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Course I do! Let's go around and see if anyone else wants to join us!\r\n\r\nBan Tsugumi: Now then, the cookies and macarons are ready. Please eat them, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: I still don't get why you made these, but if you're giving then I'll take 'em. (chew chew, chew chew...)\r\nKofuki: ...Mmmm... There's this weird... Grassy? Taste to the cookies. And these macarons kinda taste like medicine.\r\nTsugumi: Have you noticed any changes to your body yet? To tell the truth, I mixed several things into them while I was cooking.\r\nTsugumi: Barley grass juice, protein powder, coconut oil, chia seeds, acai pulp, along with...\r\nKofuki: Well no shit it tastes awful!! What're you gonna do if this stuff messes me up!?\r\nTsugumi: Everything I put in there should be good for you. Though knowing you, you'll be fine, Shichinosato-san. And like they say, failure is the path to success.\r\nKofuki: If you thought it'd fail, then don't give it to me!! Use yourself if you want a test subject!! I'm never eating anything you cook ever again!!\r\nMihono: 'Scuse us! Are you two busy right now? I wanted to ask you about the White Day Wars...\r\nTsugumi: Ah, you came at just the right time. I made these sweets, so...\r\nKofuki: Stop, dumbass!!\r\n\r\nKanami: --Anyway, we're looking for people to join our team! Did either of you say you'd help anybody else yet?\r\nTsugumi: I haven't. Actually, this is the first I've heard of any White Day Wars.\r\nKofuki: Same. But I'm always down to kill some aradama. Don't need any kind of prize besides that.\r\nKofuki: So anyway, I'm joining as a one man team! That way I get all the aradama to myself!\r\nTsugumi: That's how Shichinosato-san is... Now that I think of it, I did receive instructions to investigate the candy carrying aradama.\r\nTsugumi: So do you mind if I join you, Shichinosato-san?\r\nKofuki: Fine, whatever! Just don't mess with me anymore!\r\nTsugumi: ...Fufufu. I'm looking forward to seeing what sort of effect those sweets have on her in combat.\r\nKanami: And they're gone... Well, we can't afford to lose to them! We'll just have to look for allies while we're out there fighting!\r\n\r\nEllen: ...Kaoru, did you hear? It sounds like there's some big fun event going on?\r\nKaoru: Fun? You sure you don't mean annoying?\r\nEllen: What are you saying! They're all turning it into a competition! Of course it'll be fun!\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nEllen: See, Nene's getting into it too! We should make a team together, Kaoru! Let's start getting candy right away!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Mai and Sayaka and Making Cookies\r\n\r\nKanami: It's a good thing we got Mai-chan and Sayaka-chan on our team. With the two of you here, we're unstoppable!\r\nMai: I think you might be getting your hopes too high...\r\nKanami: But we've already gotten so many sweets!\r\nMihono: So what'd we come to the cooking classroom for, anyway?\r\nMai: Well, I thought candy and marshmallows alone were too depressing. Since it's White Day, we should make cookies too.\r\nSayaka: -! Cookies...! Mai, I'll help.\r\nMai: I'd appreciate it! Can you start sifting wheat flour for me, Sayaka-chan?\r\nSayaka: Sift...?\r\nMai: This is a sifter. You pour it in the top, and it makes the flour much lighter. Do you think you can handle that?\r\nSayaka: Understood. I'll do it.\r\nKanami: Ah! They just updated the competition rankings!\r\nKanami: Let's see... Looks like a lot of toji joined in!\r\nKanami: First place right now is... Shichinosato-san and Ban-san's team!\r\nMihono: Just two people made it to first!? Nobody beats Fukki when it comes to getting rid of aradama, I guess.\r\nKanami: And Ellen-chan and Kaoru-chan's team are in second!\r\nMai: It's a little hard to picture that from the carefree Ellen-chan and lazy Kaoru-chan.\r\nMihono: Ahaha, you're right.\r\nSayaka: Mai, I sifted it all.\r\nMai: Thanks! Next, I need the batter... Ah, Sayaka-chan, your cheek's all white with flour?\r\nMai: Come here, I'll wipe it off for you.\r\nSayaka: Nn...\r\nMihono: We're only in fourth place... We're going to need more people if we want to stand a chance of getting that prize!\r\n*everyone's phones ring*\r\nMihono: --Bad news! They just sent out an alert for another aradama sighting! We've gotta get going!\r\nSayaka: Mai, the cookies...\r\nMai: We'll have to leave them now and finish cooking later, okay?\r\nSayaka: Okay!\r\n\r\nKamo Chinami: So those four went and started baking sweets? Looking pretty girly in here~. I could start taking notes!\r\nChinami: --Ahh! That reminds me, Chinatsu-chan and Hoozuki-chan asked me for some White Day lessons! I'd better go see them as soon as these aradama are dealt with!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Chinami-sensei's White Day Lecture\r\n\r\nTerashimo Hoozuki: Working as both a toji and a magazine model, with her scabbard looking cute as ever today, Chinami-sensei is here to answer our questions!\r\nHoozuki: To get things started, when it comes to White Day, I'd like to do something a little different from everyone else! Do you have any advice, Chinami-sensei-?\r\nChinami: I get complimented a lot in my line of work, but you're the only one who always admires my scabbard, Hoozuki-chan. A future lacquerer's got that special attention to detail, after all!\r\nChinami: So anyway, back to your question, it's nice to change things up, but being different for the sake of difference isn't going to work!\r\nChinami: What's most important is choosing something that suits you and you're comfortable with! Try starting with something you already like as a motif!\r\nHoozuki: I get it! So what if I put on some scabbard cosplay, and hand out scabbard shaped cookies!\r\nChinami: You sure you're not thinking of Halloween?\r\nShimoishii Chinatsu: I have a question for you too, Chinami-sensei.\r\nChinatsu: I've never baked any sweets before, so do you have any advice on how to not screw up for White Day?\r\nChinami: You've always so busy studying after all, Chinatsu-chan. Even though you're in the swordsmith department, don't you sit in on lectures for the engineering and research departments?\r\nChinatsu: Yes. I'm no good at dealing with free time. So I try to fill it with learning as much as possible...!\r\nChinami: A busybody like you doesn't have to force herself to make anything. You can buy something nice from from a store, you know?\r\nChinami: If your sweets don't turn out the way you want them, I'd hate to see you depressed over losing both time and ingredients.\r\nHoozuki: I see!\r\nMihono: No wonder Chinami-sensei has a lot of female fans. I feel like I'm learning a lot!\r\nKanami: Me, me! I have a question too! How are you planning on spending your White Day, Chinami-sensei?\r\nChinami: ...Well in my case, February and March are sort of a trial. Like she said, I have a lot of female fans.\r\nChinami: And so many of them send in chocolates and sweets for Valentines and White Day.\r\nChinami: I don't even want to think about the calories from eating them all, but with everyone's feelings baked into them, I can't exactly give those sweets to anyone else, you know?\r\nChinami: Plus, as a model, I need to watch my figure, so actually I'm on an extra strict diet right now...\r\nHoozuki: I'd expect no less from you, Sensei! Fighting the calories, you still eat all of them! That gentlemanly side of you is so charming!\r\nKoike Saaya: Excuse me. I'm Koike Saaya, a third year high schooler with the Heijou Institute's patrol department! Another group of aradama have just been sighted, so we need all toji to prepare to sortie!\r\nChinami: --Well then. How does aradama extermination sound for burning some calories?\r\nChinatsu: Chinami-sensei! I'll give you backup!\r\nChinami: Okay! I'll count on you! And, Kanami-chan and Mihono-chan? Is it okay if I tag along with your team?\r\nKanami: Of course! We'd love to have you!\r\n\r\nSaaya: ...The White Day Wars. It seems like there's already a huge stockpile of candy and marshmallows gathered from aradama.\r\nSaaya: But I'd like to give everyone a taste of something a little better. I'll just add a special ingredient~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: After the Sour Konbu Culprit!\r\n\r\nKanami: We sure pulled in a lot of candy and marshmallows, huh. It takes a while for just two people to move around.\r\nMihono: Let's see, we're supposed to leave what we won't eat in the storeroom, right?\r\nKanami: Whoa! There's so many sweets in here!\r\nMihono: They told everyone to freely drop them off, so it looks like they've been piling up one after another.\r\nMihono: --There we go. Now that that's taken care of, we should meet back up with the others.\r\n*Kanami and Mihono leave*\r\n\r\nKoike Saaya: ...Fufu. Looks like more sweets have been delivered.\r\nSaaya: Then I'll get right to it. Just have to swap these in with the candies--\r\nKanami: Now!! Grab the suspect!!\r\nMihono: Give it up!!\r\n*Kanami and Mihono bust in and grab Saaya*\r\nSaaya: -!? But you left!?\r\nKanami: We made a lot of extra noise as we were leaving, then quietly came back in!\r\nMihono: We heard reports the candy stored here had some weird sour taste.\r\nMihono: But it's not like they could go bad that fast. We thought something was up, so we stayed on guard. And that's when you came sneaking in, Saaya-san.\r\nKanami: Saaya-san! Answer us! Why are you mixing sour konbu in with the candies!? That's really mean for a prank!\r\nSaaya: P-Prank!? Sweets and sour konbu go hand in hand like perfect matrimony! Don't you feel the same way!?\r\nMihono: ...M-Mattremoney?\r\nSaaya: It means marriage in French~. When the two combine, their flavors enhance each other.\r\nSaaya: I was only giving everyone a taste of something better!\r\nKanami: ...Saaya-san, please listen carefully. Candy and sour konbu don't go together at all.\r\nSaaya: Hmph! That's not true...! Everyone knows sweet and sour things have high affinity for each other...\r\nSaaya: ...\r\nSaaya: ... ...... .........\r\nSaaya: ...Ah, you're right. This tastes terrible.\r\nMihono: You never even tried it!?\r\nSaaya: Well, I eat a lot of sour konbu on its own, so...\r\nSaaya: But there are lots of people who won't eat it, so I thought if I mixed it in with the candy they'd start realizing how great it tastes...\r\nKanami: Basically, you just thought you were helping out...\r\nSaaya: What a heartbreaking incident...\r\nMihono: You don't get to say that!\r\n*phone rings*\r\nSaaya: --Headquarters is contacting me! There's reports of more aradama sightings!\r\nKanami: That's a bigger issue! We can deal with Saaya-san later; let's hurry!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Kotatsu Roundtable\r\n\r\nUraga Nao: Ahh~, reunited with Kotatsu-san at last~. If an aradama showed up right now, I don't know that I'd be able to escape from under here again~.\r\nMizushina Kinuka: That's no good~. But kotatsu have magic that makes you powerless the moment you enter them, after all~.\r\nNao: You get it, Mizushina-san~. Here, eat some oranges.\r\nKinuka: Don't go pushing unpeeled oranges in my face! But thank you, I will~.\r\nKinuka: Anyway, everybody sure seems to be getting all worked up over these White Day Wars~. Not like it has anything to do with us tucked away in here though~.\r\nNao: But it's doing a nice job of raising morale, isn't it~. Speaking of which, what are the rankings like now?\r\nKinuka: Let's see. Seems like first place is still Shichinosato-san and Ban-san. Their lead just keeps pulling farther ahead of the others.\r\nKinuka: Shichinosato-san seems to be in unusually good condition to be going at those aradama so enthusiastically. Could they be doping?\r\nKinuka: In second place is Kohagura-san's team. Though with the slacker Mashiko-san with her, they seem to be struggling to compete.\r\nNao: That girl never changes. Though, when it comes to a volunteer event like this, I can sort of understand how she feels~.\r\nNao: And I can't exactly say the prize is worth the effort either~.\r\nKinuka: Uraga-san, you know what the winner gets?\r\nNao: Ara, you mean you don't know, Mizushina-san? If you come in first... Ah, your phone's ringing~.\r\nKinuka: ...Understood! We'll be there right away.\r\nKinuka: --That was an urgent request. More aradama have appeared. Uraga-san, it seems we're needed.\r\nNao: I see, a swarm of aradama have been sighted in northeastern Izu. Reports from the scene say there could be up to one hundred of them. Several larger aradama were seen as well.\r\nKinuka: There's quite a lot this time, isn't there? Civilians in the area-- Seem to have practiced evacuation drills.\r\nNao: Then start studying the local topography and figuring out who to send where, miss strategic director.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: The Feelings Baked into Sweets\r\n\r\nMihono: The first annual! \"Forget About the Teams, Let's All Bake Sweets Together\" meetup~!\r\nKanami: Umm, so as an apology for everything lost in the sour konbu incident, Saaya-san provided all these ingredients for us. So we're all going to bake more sweets together!\r\nKanami: And guiding us today is none other than the eldest daughter of the Yanase Group, the patissier prodigy herself, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: Hey, Kanami-chan! Don't go calling me a prodigy or patissier or anything!\r\nSayaka: Patissier prodigy... It fits you, Mai.\r\nMai: Not you too, Sayaka-chan!\r\nKaoru: You can do it, everyone. It's all too much for me, so I'll let Nene handle my share.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nKofuki: ...Sigh. I wanted to kill time till more aradama showed up, but I don't think this is my thing.\r\nKiyoka: Do you not like baking, Shichinosato-san?\r\nKofuki: Besides hunting aradama, nothing's really any fun. And what's the point of all this cooking when it ends up the same in your stomach anyway? Might as well just eat it like this.\r\nKiyoka: That's not true! The greatest flavoring of all is a girl's feelings as she bakes them into her cooking!\r\nKiyoka: The feelings you have when you think about the person who'll be eating it make it so much tastier!\r\nKofuki: Tch... Fine, whatever. There's nothing better to do, so I'll give it a shot.\r\nKiyoka: Alright, let's do our best! --Ah, Shichinosato-san! Please don't go sneaking a taste of the ingredients already!\r\nKofuki: What's wrong with that? Raw cookie batter tastes pretty good, you know? You try some too, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: I won't have any!\r\n*everyone's phones ring*\r\nKofuki: --The phones going off like that can only mean more aradama.\r\nKofuki: Which means I've got no more time to waste on this! Wait for me, aradama-chan! I'll be right there!\r\nKiyoka: Ahh, but we're in the middle of cooking...!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Kiyoka's Confession!?\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Um... Thank you for waiting. Sorry I called you out here all of a sudden.\r\nKiyoka: ...These chocolates, I made them. I meant to give you them on Valentines Day, but I couldn't find the courage, and now it's already White Day...\r\nKiyoka: I've... I've always liked you!! If it's okay with you, will you please go out with me!?\r\nKiyoka: ...Phew, enough practice. It'd be nice if I could give someone chocolates like that someday...\r\n*bushes rustling*\r\nKiyoka: -!? Is someone there!?\r\nKanami: Sorry, we didn't mean to hide, but...\r\nMihono: Yeah, we weren't trying to hide... Pft-hahaha...\r\nKiyoka: You two... Did you spy on me!?\r\nKanami: W-We weren't spying! We didn't spy on your solo love confession practice, Musumi-san!\r\nMihono: Yeah, yeah! We didn't spy on your fantasy about calling some guy out to give chocolates you meant to hand over on Valentines!\r\nKiyoka: You saw the whole thing, didn't you!!\r\nMihono: Don't worry! We aren't gonna tell anyone! But, I can't make any guarantees if you don't join our team, you know?\r\nKiyoka: You're blackmailing me!?\r\nMihono: I'm just kidding. But with you on our team, we'd be able to close the distance to first place.\r\nKiyoka: ...Okay then. I'll join your team, Hono-chan.\r\nKiyoka: But only on one condition: Let me watch you and Etou-san act out your dream confession together right now!\r\nMihono: Huhh!? I can't do that!!\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan! We have to get Musumi-san to work with us! So let's give it our best shot!\r\nMihono: Why're you getting into this, Kanami!?\r\n*everyone's phones ring*\r\nMihono: Ah-! O-Oh no-! Looks like more aradama showed up! Guess we need to get going, huh-!\r\nKiyoka: I won't let you get out of this, Hono-chan! If aradama showed up, then you'll just have to confess while you're fighting!\r\nMihono: While we're fighting!? How do you expect me to pull that off!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: White Day Wars, Concluded!\r\n\r\nKanami: They're finally publishing the results of the White Day Wars. I'm getting goosebumps...\r\nMihono: Thanks to Kiyoka joining us, we managed to haul in tons of sweets towards the end! We might've pulled off a big reversal...!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, I helped you out, so you have to let me see your confession after, remember?\r\nMihono: I-I don't know what you're talking about~...\r\nTsugumi: We held first place through most of the competition, but I'm not sure about the results... Shichinosato-san only went after larger aradama in the second half, so our numbers could have fallen behind...\r\nTsugumi: Even after my sweets gave you a boost too...\r\nKofuki: It's not like I care about this ranking stuff anyway. I got to kill a ton of aradama, so I'm satisfied.\r\nEllen: Ahahaha! Look, Kaoru! Nene took all the marshmallows we found and made a sofa out of them!\r\nNene: Ne-! Ne-!\r\nKaoru: What's so fun about that... And you'd better eat all those marshmallows when you're done.\r\nEllen: Don't worry about it! I'm sure the staff will take care of it!\r\nKaoru: What staff?\r\nNao: ...Excuse me, is everyone here? I'm not sure why, but Mizushina-san and I have been asked to announce the results of the White Day Wars.\r\nKinuka: Thank you for all your hard work, everyone. Despite the many sightings of aradama, we were able to deal with them without civilian casualties.\r\nNao: All because of how quickly you were able to dispatch and suppress aradama as they appeared. Really, thank you all.\r\nNao: And with that, I'll now announce the first place winner. The overall winner of the first White Day Wars is... Kohagura Ellen's Team!\r\nEllen: ---!? We did it!! We did it, Kaoru!! Our team won!!\r\nKaoru:  Who'd have guessed. Looks like it was worth getting dragged along by you.\r\nNene : Ne-!! Ne-!!\r\nKinuka: Congratulations. As a reward for their victory, all the sweets in the storeroom will be delivered to Ellen-san's team!\r\nEllen: ...Eh? All the sweets? Aren't you just dumping the leftovers on us...?\r\nNao: I should mention, by the way, that you can't refuse this offer.\r\nEllen: Are you serious!? What are we supposed do with a year's worth of candy and marshmallows!?\r\nKaoru: Tell me this is a joke... I really shouldn't have bothered with this in the first place...\r\nTsugumi: Our team only placed third in the end. Thank goodness we didn't win. Shichinosato-san made the right call.\r\nKanami: We came in second! We were so close to first place; that's so frustrating...!\r\nMihono: I'm a little frustrated too, but since we were this close to having our rooms filled wall to wall with candy and marshmallows, I think it turned out for the best?\r\nKiyoka: More importantly, Hono-chan, hurry up and do your confession--\r\nKinuka: Ah, everyone, may I have your attention for a moment? I said this earlier, but thanks to everyone's efforts, not a single civilian was harmed. That really is a remarkable achievement.\r\nKinuka: And so, in case this happens next year, I look forward to all of you participating in the White Day Wars again.\r\nMihono: Alright!! We're gonna win for sure next time-!!\r\nEllen: I've had enough of candy and marshmallows for one lifetime! Get a real prize if you want us to do this again!"}, {"paste_key": "z1rdgcuF", "title": "Origami Yukari Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/z1rdgcuF", "timestamp": "", "hits": "140", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEvFCJ506mU\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqqcokWQfeE\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Z23ZqgN4an4\r\n\r\n1: The Head of the Origami Family and Nene\r\n\r\nSeveral hours before the tournament began--\r\n\r\nKaoru: Hmm-? Huh, that's weird... He was just here a minute ago... Hey, Ellen. You seen Nene anywhere?\r\nEllen: Nene? Now that you mention it, I haven't.\r\nKaoru: Damnit, that little... Did he forget he's an aradama or something?\r\n\r\nBodyguard Toji: Find it! It has to be around here somewhere! Tch, to think we let an aradama all the way in here...!\r\nNene: Ne-...!\r\nBodyguard Toji: Th-There it is! So that's where you were hiding!\r\nNene: N-Nenene-!?\r\n\r\nYukari: ...They're awfully noisy out there...\r\nNene: Ne...\r\nYukari: You're the one from the Mashiko family...\r\nNene: Nene, nene-!\r\nYukari: But what are you doing here? Don't you understand what this place is?\r\nNene: Ne-? Nene, nenene-.\r\nYukari: Where is the Mashiko toji? Shouldn't you always be at her side?\r\nNene: Ne-, nene-! Nenene-! Ne-, nene-!\r\nYukari: ...There's no point in attempting conversation, is there...\r\nYukari: Fine then. Do as you like. So long as you don't disturb my work, you can stay.\r\nNene: Ne~...\r\nYukari: Hmm... Where's the list of tournament participants. From Renpu... The toji Yukina told me about would be...\r\nNene: Ne~ Nene~!\r\nYukari: Hmm...\r\nNene: Ne~ Nene-ne~!\r\nYukari: What? Do you want me to play with you...?\r\nYukari: That reminds me, the institution I inspected the other day offered me wagashi... Would you like some?\r\nNene: Ne-! Nene-!\r\nYukari: Very well. I'll go get them.\r\n\r\nNene: Ne~! Nene~!\r\nYukari: An aradama happily eating wagashi... Really, what an odd thing you are.\r\nVoice: Oiii, Nene-! If you're there, say something-! Ughh, how far'd he run off to?\r\nVoice: Nene-! We explained everything to the guards, so they won't chase you anymore-!\r\nNene: Ne...!\r\nYukari: I see, so that's what happened. You were the cause of the commotion earlier.\r\nNene: Nene, ne-, nene-?\r\nYukari: Hm? You're leaving already? Ahh, then you may go. But first... There is one thing I need to ask.\r\nNene: Ne-?\r\nYukari: By all rights, humans and aradama are incapable of coexisting. Yet, in spite of that, you've taken up as the guardian beast of the Mashiko family.\r\nYukari: Do you feel content living alongside humans?\r\nNene: ...Ne~?\r\nYukari: ......\r\nNene: Nene~...?\r\nYukari: Ha...\u3000No, it wasn't a question I should have asked you, I suppose.\r\nYukari: Leave. Do not ever return here. Do you understand?\r\nNene: Ne-! Nenene-!\r\nYukari: At the end there, was it thanking me...? Ha... What an odd thing indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Her Conviction\r\n\r\nMaki: Yukari-sama, it's Shidou. I brought the documents you requested.\r\nYukari: Enter.\r\nMaki: Right, excuse me.\r\nMaki: Here, please look over them.\r\nMaki: This is a compilation of all aradama outbreaks in recent years. And, in here is a list of all toji who enrolled in the Five Traditions this year.\r\nYukari: Good work. I see... With this many entrants, it doesn't seem we'll have to worry about going shorthanded on toji in the near future.\r\nYukari: However, the issue at hand isn't one of manpower, but that we lack the ability to freely increase the number of toji... Isn't that right?\r\nMaki: Yes. New okatana can be polished from Akabane swords, but the number of those we recover is never enough--\r\nMaki: --Nn?\r\nYume: Yu~kari-sama~! Let's pla... Oh, huh?\r\nYume: Dang~, Maki onee-san's here.\r\nMaki: Yume... From the way it sounds, you were coming to bother Yukari-sama again, weren't you?\r\nYume: But come on, what else am I supposed to do? Besides Yukari-sama, nobody's worth fighting against.\r\nMaki: ......\r\nYukari: Yume, I'm at work right now. Leave.\r\nYume: Tch, that's no fun.\r\nYume: Anyway, I'll be back later. Bye bye~!\r\nMaki: ......\r\nYukari: You look discouraged, Maki. Is it because Yume doesn't acknowledge your skill with a sword?\r\nMaki: ...I believe I understand Yume's feelings towards swordfighting. I have no idea how she hides all her resolve in that small body.\r\nMaki: But, as a toji, I don't think my conviction and resolve are any weaker than hers. In spite of that, I'm still no match for Yume...\r\nYukari: ...I see. Maki, you mentioned \"conviction\", but conviction is a desire to see something through.\r\nYukari: For example, no matter how many failures it takes, you would continue pursuing your goal. That's the sort of emotion it is.\r\nYukari: So, your conviction as a toji, what does it drive you to accomplish? To improve your skills with a sword, until there are none greater than you?\r\nMaki: Ah...\r\nMaki: No, I only want to be strong enough to protect everyone and the people close to me from the threat of aradama...!\r\nYukari: If that's your goal, then don't be misguided in pursuing it. Just as Yume found her strength, you have your own. That's why I entrusted you with the first seat of the elite guard.\r\nMaki: Right! I'll take that to heart!\r\nYukari: Then, return to your duties. I'll examine these documents in more detail later.\r\nMaki: Understood! I'll be going then!\r\nYukari: ......\r\nYukari: (...Conviction...? How many years have I passed hanging onto that, I wonder...)\r\nYukari: (But, even that... Will be over soon--)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Partners in Killing Time\r\n\r\nYukari: ......Hm. It gets quiet alone in the office by myself.\r\nYukari: Though having said that, I can't exactly take a stroll outside without purpose. Acting as the head of the Origami family can be such an inconvenient position.\r\nYukari: ...Nn?\r\nYume: Hellooo~, Yu~kari-sama~!\r\nYukari: Yume...? Enter.\r\nYume: Ah-, none of the others are in here today? Nice, lucky me-!\r\nYukari: ......\r\nYume: Hey, don't worry. I didn't come to play today. I actually have something really important I wanted to tell you, Yukari-sama.\r\nYukari: Oh...?\r\nYume: Juuust kidding-!\r\n\r\nYume: Aww~, I lost again.\r\nSuzuka: Oh? What happened, Yume?\r\nYume: I was sure I'd be able to beat Yukari-sama today. But I screwed up.\r\nSuzuka: ...Hold it right there, Yume. You don't mean, you--\r\n\r\nSuzuka: I'm deeply sorry, Yukari-sama! The moment I took my eyes off Yume, she came attacking you again...!\r\nYukari: It's fine. Pay it no mind.\r\nSuzuka: But...\r\nYukari: In that case, will you put the room back in order after Yume made a mess of it? That may take some of the guilt off your mind.\r\nSuzuka: Yes, I'll see to it at once!\r\n\r\nYukari: Well done. That's enough, Suzuka.\r\nSuzuka: Understood. Um... I know this may be rude, but there's something I would like to ask.\r\nYukari: What is it? Speak your mind.\r\nSuzuka: Why is it that you always encourage Yume by playing along with her? Surely you wouldn't allow anyone else to be so disrespectful.\r\nYukari: Do you disapprove?\r\nSuzuka: No, that's not what I...! Only... I was wondering, if there's some special reason why you give her such freedom...\r\nYukari: Hm... A reason why I allow Yume freedom...?\r\n\r\nYume: There you go again, Yukari-sama! I thought I took you by surprise, but you blocked that so easy...!\r\nYume: But, I'm not done yet!\r\nYukari: Hm...\r\nYume: You look like you don't even care, but...! I can't even land a single hit!\r\nYukari: Are you done now, Yume?\r\nYume: Of course not! Let's see how you handle this-!\r\nYume: Hyaaahhh-!\r\nYukari: (Oh, she's altered her swordsmanship yet again... Intriguing.)\r\n\r\nYukari: (In spite of the fate her body is confined to, Yume's swordsmanship remains completely unbounded...)\r\nSuzuka: Um... Yukari-sama?\r\nYukari: It's nothing... Suzuka, to me, that is a way of killing time.\r\nYukari: So please, leave her be. She may not seem like it, but Yume is still considerate of the proper time and place.\r\nSuzuka: ...I understand. If that's what you wish, Yukari-sama.\r\nSuzuka: With that, I'll take my leave.\r\nYukari: (Yume's swordsmanship... That's what I feel from it-- \"Freedom\".)\r\nYukari: (That... May be the reason. Why I find it so amusing to receive Yume's sword...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Secret Pastime\r\n\r\nYomi: I'll be going then, Yukari-sama.\r\nYukari: This investigation into the Special Ritual Squad's equipment loss rate last year... How long do you think it will take?\r\nYomi: The data is already roughly accumulated, so it should only take about one hour to request it from the person in charge.\r\nYukari: Understood. I'll leave you to it.\r\nYomi: Yes. Then, goodbye.\r\nYukari: ...Is she gone? Then...\r\nYukari: Let's get to this at once. I should still have some in stock... ...Hm, there they are.\r\nYukari: I have to open a window before anything else. Some ventilation is essential, so... There.\r\nYukari: Now-- Time to begin.\r\nYukari: Add the seasoning, then pour in hot water for 3 minutes. After that, remove the water and mix in the sauce. I see, fairly standard... This cup yakisoba.\r\nYukari: Last time 4 minutes passed without me noticing, and the noodles had hardly any stiffness. Though, I didn't dislike it...\r\nYukari: This vinyl cover... I can leave it in the drawer for now and dispose of it later.\r\nYukari: (If it were ever found out that the favorite food of the head of the Origami family was instant cup yakisoba-- All the dignity with which I've established myself until now could crumble...)\r\nYukari: (People will not follow strength alone.)\r\nYukari: (Dignity, formality, charisma... All accomplish nothing more than creating an impression, however they are indispensable to leading an organization.)\r\nYukari: (It goes without saying that this must be kept hidden from Maki and Suzuka, Yume of course, and even Yomi.)\r\nYukari: However, it's a real oddity... Cup yakisoba. It seems like every night I feel the urge to eat some... In spite of its crudeness...\r\nYukari: No, but then again, maybe I should consider it from the perspective of a simple provision. All it requires is hot water, and with only 3 minutes needed to prepare... I cannot disrespect this-- This example of human ingenuity.\r\nYukari: Those 3 minutes should have passed by now. Hm... That's quite a good scent.\r\nYukari: (Slurp, slurrp...)\r\n\r\nYomi: I've returned, Yukari-sama. Here is the data you requested.\r\nYukari: Good, sorry to trouble you.\r\nYomi: No...\r\nYomi: ...? Um, Yukari-sama.\r\nYukari: What is it?\r\nYomi: Did you open a window? The room's temperature seems different from before I left.\r\nYukari: ......\r\nYukari: I thought a little ventilation would help clear my mind. What of it?\r\nYomi: I just wondered if the air conditioning might be malfunctioning. I didn't mean to question you...\r\nYukari: You don't need to concern yourself with that. I'm not a flower in a greenhouse.\r\nYomi: Yes ma'am, I'll keep that in mind.\r\nYukari: That's enough for today, Yomi. Return to the dormitory and rest.\r\nYomi: Understood. Then, I'll take my leave.\r\nYukari: ..................Hm. The position of the head of the Origami household needs consideration as well.\r\n\r\nYomi: (......)\r\nYomi: (What was that small stain on Yukari-sama's clothing...? It wasn't there an hour ago...)\r\nYomi: (Soy sauce...? Or some other sauce...?)\r\nMaki: What's wrong, Yomi? Is something on your mind?\r\nYomi: ......\r\nSuzuka: Yomi?\r\nYomi: ......No, it's nothing.\r\nYomi: Yukari-sama ordered me to rest, so will one of you please take over for me?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Remnant of the Past\r\n\r\nMaki: Are you sure about this, Yukari-sama?\r\nYukari: Yes, I don't mind.\r\nSuzuka: Please, wait. Even for practice, four against one is too much...\r\nYume: But what's wrong with that-? Yukari-sama's the one saying we can do it. Right? Yomi onee-san.\r\nYomi: If that's what she orders, I'll go along with it.\r\nSuzuka: Still...\r\nYukari: Suzuka... Surely you don't mean you're worried about me?\r\nYukari: If so-- Are you that incapable of judging your opponent's strength; is that what you are saying?\r\nSuzuka: ...!\r\nMaki: Suzuka... I think you're getting needlessly worried. Even against a group, Yukari-sama's skills should be far greater than our own.\r\nMaki: And in that case... We should test ourselves against them. To find out just how we stack up to Yukari-sama. Isn't this a good opportunity to know more about ourselves?\r\nSuzuka: Fu... That's very like you, Maki-san.\r\nYume: Hey, hey, let's get going already-.\r\nYomi: Shidou-san, do you have a plan?\r\nMaki: I don't. Only to show the results of our daily training.\r\nYukari: ...Then let's begin. All of you, come at me with everything you can manage.\r\n\r\nYukari: What's the matter? Are you finished?\r\nSuzuka: Pant, pant... Even with the four of us, we can't keep up after all...!\r\nMaki: That's the might of Origami Yukari...!\r\nYume: What are you giving up for already, let's keep going-!\r\nYukari: Fu...\r\nSuzuka: Yomi, let's rush her together!\r\nYomi: Understood.\r\nSuzuka: Kh... Maki-san! You're next!\r\nMaki: Haaaaaahh-!!!\r\nYukari: (All members, consecutively attacking from Yume's starting point... To be able to coordinate to this degree without any prior signal; strong movements like these do justice to the name of elite guard...)\r\nYukari: (Fu, it reminds me, the Special Task Team was like that as well...)\r\nYukari: (Those who once fought at my side. Souraku Yuzuki, Takatsu Yukina, Hashima Ema, Gojou Iroha, Maniwa Sana-- As well as Hiiragi Kagari and Fujiwara Minato...)\r\nYukari: (Thinking back on it, despite all our differences in temperament and fighting style, it was impressive how well we were able to match each other's movements...)\r\nYukari: (Has it really been twenty years...? Kagari and Minato are gone, and time has taken its toll on the others. Yet, I still...)\r\nMaki: Gh... Gah...!\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san!?\r\nMaki: Kh... I-I can still...!\r\nYukari: ...That's enough. Sheath your okatana. Training is over.\r\nYume: Pant, pant, pant... I-I'm, still, ready to fight, though...?\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san. Catch your breath.\r\nYume: Ughh... Grrrr...!\r\nYukari: Relax, Yume. I'll provide you more opportunities.\r\nYukari: Maki, Suzuka, and Yomi all showed good coordination as well. Though there's room for improvement in your teamwork.\r\nMaki: ...I understand. But next time, I'll show you how much closer I can reach to you...!\r\nYukari: Good, do not forget that feeling.\r\nYukari: Those who cannot recognize their inexperience, have no room to grow from it...\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/sMZQqm5pL1U\r\n[Renpu High: Start]: Marshmallows\r\n\r\nMinato: Yukari, Kagari, morning-!\r\nYukari: Morning, Minato.\r\nKagari: Good morning.\r\nMinato: You gotta hear this! Last night, I had this awesome dream-! In my dream, we were all a part of the tournament...\r\nMinato: But the white gravel at the tournament grounds had all turned into marshmallows, so we couldn't do it, and then we just decided to eat them all!\r\nKagari: Sigh... I shouldn't be surprised, Minato-senpai. Even your dreams don't make any sense...\r\nMinato: I mean, it was such a crazy dream that I felt like I had to tell you as soon as possible! You know how it is, right? Hey, Yukari, what kinda dream did you have last night?\r\nYukari: My dream last night... I think I had one...\r\nYukari: Ah...!\r\nKagari: Yukari-sama? What is it?\r\nYukari: It's nothing. Look, school is starting. Let's go to our classrooms.\r\nMinato: What that was about. Yukari was acting a little weird, wasn't she?\r\nKagari: Was she? Anyway, if we don't hurry, we'll be late. Really now, this is all your fault for launching into some long and pointless story about your dreams, Minato-senpai...\r\nMinato: Sorry about that. But still, wouldn't it be funny if that dream ended up coming true~?\r\n\r\nIn a break between classes.\r\n\r\nMinato: Ah~, I'm starving. I can't believe it's still only 2nd period.\r\nYukari: Minato. So you were over here.\r\nMinato: Yeah, I was hungry, so I thought I'd buy some bread from the school store. Why're you here, Yukari?\r\nYukari: No reason, really. We have music class next, don't we? Let's go together.\r\nMinato: O-Okay...\r\n\r\nAfter school that day.\r\n\r\nMinato: Ah~, I can't be bothered today, so maybe I'll skip practice and take an afternoon nap.\r\nYukari: Minato, you came out here to skip practice again...\r\nMinato: Sorry about that, Yukari. I'll try extra hard in practice starting tomorrow, so give everyone my regards~!\r\nYukari: Wait. If you won't be coming to practice, I'll do self-training at my household too, so let's leave together.\r\nMinato: Eh-- You will!?\r\nKagari: What's going on, Yukari-sama? You're skipping practice along with Minato-senpai?\r\nYukari: There's no real reason for it. I just thought it would be nice for us to walk home together for once. Come on, Kagari, Minato. Let's go.\r\nKagari: There's something strange about Yukari-sama today, isn't there?\r\nMinato: That's what I'm saying. It always feels like I'm the one sticking close to Yukari, but today it's like it's the other way around... I wonder what happened... Nn-, I wanna know!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Renpu High: End]: Dream Come True\r\n\r\nMinato: Ahh~, the three of us skipping practice and going home together feels all fresh and exciting! Want to stop by somewhere?\r\nKagari: Yukari-sama and I will be practicing as soon as we return to the Origami household. Please don't treat us like your accomplices, Minato-senpai.\r\nMinato: Come on, don't be such a stick in the mud~. We never go home early together! There's this super cool secret spot I found that I'll show you.\r\nYukari: Secret spot? And where is that?\r\nMinato: You'll have to wait and see. C'mon, let's go!\r\n\r\nMinato: You two are so slow~. If you keep it up, the sun's gonna go down~!\r\nKagari: Pant, pant. You're taking us up quite the mountain trail.\r\nYukari: Minato, can't we leave it at this and go home for today? I have a strange feeling about this.\r\nMinato: Hey, Yukari, what's this feeling about anyway? You've been acting kinda weird since this morning. Come on and tell us.\r\nYukari: ...\r\nMinato: If you just explain things, I'll hear you out, okay?\r\nYukari: I might just be getting afraid over nothing, but, this morning, I had a strange dream.\r\nYukari: Up in a mountain, there was this mysterious shrine I had never seen before. You went running up the steps to it, Minato... And then, the moment I took my eyes off you, you vanished.\r\nKagari: As in... She was spirited away?\r\nYukari: I can't say that for sure, but I woke up with this feeling of unease, and it's worrying me.\r\nMinato: Alright, I get it now! It's true that, unlike my dream, this one sounds like it could actually happen.\r\nKagari: Minato-senpai, given what Yukari-sama is saying, can we not stop here today and go back?\r\nMinato: Hmm, you have a point. If Yukari's that sure about it... \r\nMinato: I know! Won't everything be fine if I just don't go on ahead like I did in Yukari's dream?\r\nMinato: I'll stay right with you every step of the way, alright? Since we already came this far, you'll definitely be missing out if you don't see it now! Okay?\r\nYukari: If you insist, Minato... Fine then, let's go see.\r\nMinato: You've got to! Don't worry; so long as the three of us are together, no matter where we go, we'll make it through!\r\n\r\nMinato: Okaaay, here we are!\r\nYukari: This is...\r\nKagari: I didn't think cherry blossoms could still be in bloom somewhere at this time of season...\r\nMinato: This place is hidden away on the north side of the mountain, so it doesn't get much sun, which means the cherry blossoms bloom later than usual.\r\nYukari: I'm surprised you managed to find a place like this.\r\nMinato: I saw it in a dream I had. There were all these cherry blossoms blooming on the north side of a mountain. So I got interested, and when I came to check it out, I found this!\r\nKagari: You mean, your dream came true then?\r\nMinato: Yep. If Yukari's dream came true, that'd be scary, but I'm glad a fun dream like this one was real!\r\nYukari: That's for sure. I hope we can be spared Minato getting spirited away or the gravel turning to marshmallows, but I'm very glad to see a dream like this come true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Z23ZqgN4an4\r\n[Dress '20 - Yukari: Start]: Recognition Party Put in Motion\r\n\r\nYume: I wanna have a party!\r\nYukari: A party?\r\nMaki: Where's this coming from all of a sudden, Yume?\r\nYume: The onee-sans who were in the Miss Five Traditions contest are all getting together for a party!\r\nYume: So we should do it too!\r\nSuzuka: If that's what you meant, then I've heard about it as well.\r\nSuzuka: Though, it seemed to be more of a recognition party than a simple gathering.\r\nYukari: A recognition party? If that's how it is, I should be the one to host it.\r\nMaki: You'll host it, Yukari-sama?\r\nYukari: Miss Five Traditions was something I carried out. Which should make a recognition party my responsibility.\r\nSuzuka: In that case, I'll make arrangements for the location.\r\nYukari: Please do.\r\nYomi: Then, I'll take care of the food.\r\nYukari: Right.\r\nMaki: Yume and I will do something to cover for our regular duties.\r\nYume: If we're suppressing aradama, just leave it to me.\r\nYukari: Then, I'm depending on you.\r\nElite Guard: Yes ma'am!\r\n\r\nSana: You're doing a recognition party?\r\nYukari: I've already told Ema and the others. Could you fit it in your schedules, Sana, Yuzuki?\r\nYuzuki: That's fine with me, but, isn't this party for the girls who appeared in Miss Five Traditions?\r\nYuzuki: Wouldn't it be better to keep ourselves out of the way?\r\nSana: I can imagine Kaoru wouldn't be too happy about it.\r\nYukari: I'd like to keep it private, but, if I'm the one to host it, that won't be possible.\r\nYukari: Everyone involved in Miss Five Traditions will be invited too.\r\nYuzuki: ...So that's how it is.\r\nYukari: I want you two to handle things on that end.\r\nSana: So you want the toji kept free of any unnecessary hassling.\r\nYuzuki: It's bound to happen.\r\nYukari: Then, I'm relying on you for the day of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Dress '20 - Yukari: End]: Recognition Party\r\n\r\nMaki: Yukari-sama, we've finished organizing the tables.\r\nYukari: And the food?\r\nYomi: There are no issues.\r\nSuzuka: Right now, they're setting drinks at the tables.\r\nYukari: I see.\r\nYume: I drank a little bit of it, and it was really tasty.\r\nSuzuka: Oh my, where are your manners?\r\nYume: It was just a little bit though?\r\nYukari: You've done well. You should all get changed too.\r\nMaki: Yes ma'am.\r\nYume: I can't wait to see our dresses!\r\nSuzuka: I'll help pick out accessories for you.\r\nYume: Great-!\r\nYomi: Konohana-san, could you help me too?\r\nSuzuka: Very well. And of course, you'd like me to coordinate your outfit as well, Maki-san?\r\nMaki: Sure; I'd appreciate it, Suzuka.\r\n\r\nYuzuki: How is everything coming along?\r\nYukari: Yuzuki. Nothing's come up; it's all going smoothly.\r\nSana: I passed by Ellen earlier. You got some good dresses ready for them, Yukari-senpai.\r\nYukari: Only what seemed appropriate.\r\nSana: There's a gathering starting to form by now.\r\nYuzuki: We should say our hellos.\r\nSana: What about you, Yukari-senpai?\r\nYukari: I think I'll join you.\r\n\r\nMihono: Yukari-sama!\r\nYukari: Asakura Mihono.\r\nMihono: Thanks so much for today!\r\nMihono: You threw this party because I said I wanted to do a thank you party... didn't you?\r\nYukari: It's nothing you should concern yourself over.\r\nYukari: From the start, I was the one who prepared the Miss Five Traditions contest. If there was going to be a recognition party, I should be the one in charge of it.\r\nMihono: At first, I was thinking, let's all go do karaoke! But, seeing it turn into such a big party is really surprising.\r\nYukari: Did I spoil your plans?\r\nMihono: Not at all! Actually, I'm really excited to see what kind of food they bring out and stuff!\r\nYukari: You girls are the stars of this party.

Engaging in combat!\r\nSubordinate A: Shidou-san! You're pushing too far ahead! You're our captain, so please don't be so risky!\r\nMaki: It's because I'm the captain that I need to take the lead. I couldn't stand seeing any of my girls get hurt.\r\nSubordinate: B: Shidou-san! There's a giant aradama approaching from the northeast!\r\nMaki: What!? ...This one seems difficult.\r\nMaki: I'll manage that one by myself. The rest of you, get rid of the aradama in the surrounding area.\r\nSubordinate A: Are you serious!? That's too much for anyone to fight alone!!\r\nMaki: Don't worry. Have faith in me!\u3000\r\n\r\nMaki: Nice job. It's thanks to all your efforts that we were able to finish this without casualties.\r\nSubordinate A: We only stayed safe because you took care of that dangerous aradama all by yourself, Shidou-san.\r\nSubordinate B: Your strength is on a completely different level than ours. That's why I admire you so much, Shidou-san. \r\nMaki: I have to be. I'm the captain, after all.\r\nSubordinate A: I love how humble you can be about your accomplishments too...\r\nSubordinate B: Shidou-san's smoother than any guy, isn't she...\r\nSubordinate C: Sigh... You're such a ladykiller, Shidou-san...\r\n\r\nSuzuka: --Good work, Maki-san. It seems you've accomplished quite a lot again today.\r\nSuzuka: And you're as popular as ever among the girls of your unit.\r\nMaki: It'd be bad if the captain wasn't popular, you know.\r\nSuzuka: I believe it's a slightly different sort of popularity than you think, though.\r\nSuzuka: (Maki-san can truly be dense about that sort of thing. Fufufu. Well, that may also be part of the reason behind her popularity.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Shidou Maki's Resolve\r\n\r\nMaki: Excuse me, Yukari-sama. It's Shidou Maki. Starting today, I'll be in your care as the first seat of the elite guard.\r\nYukari: --Enter.\r\n\r\nSubordinate A: --GYAAAA-!!\r\nSubordinate B: Somebody... Somebody, help me!!\r\nMaki: Just hold on! I'll stop the aradama--\r\nSubordinate C: Shidou-san! It's too much for you to do anything about! I hate it too, but we need to escape!\r\nMaki: How can you say that!? Those are our comrades at its feet!!\r\nMaki: As the captain, I refuse to leave any of them behind!!\r\nSubordinate C: Please, get a hold of yourself!! With the way that aradama struck them down, it's already too late for them!!\r\nSubordinate C: If you don't give the order to retreat now, the whole unit will be wiped out!!\r\nMaki: --Shit!! I'm supposed to be their captain...!!\r\nMaki: But if I had the strength for it, this never should have happened...!!\r\n\r\nMaki: --On that day, many from my unit were badly wounded.\r\nMaki: They had such promising futures, and yet, with no hope of recovery, they had to be retired.\r\nMaki: I'll never forget the helplessness I felt back then. Not a moment has gone by that it hasn't agonized me.\r\nMaki: Justice is meaningless without the strength to back it up- Without the power to protect.\r\nMaki: To protect the people at your side. If I can reach that power... I don't care if it comes from heaven or hell.\r\nMaki: Today, as the first seat of Yukari-sama's elite guard, I'll allow myself to be injected with noro.\r\nMaki: I hate the idea of letting noro in my body, but it's better than losing my comrades again. Than seeing the tears that were shed that day again.\r\nMaki: Under Yukari-sama, I swear I'll purge every last aradama from the face of the earth...!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Maki's Lecture\r\n\r\nMaki: Yume. We need to talk.\r\nMaki: The other day, you were ordered to lead a unit on a mission. But I heard you got carried away in battle and left them on their own?\r\nMaki: Without their captain around, your subordinates will fall into chaos. Don't forget your duty as their leader.\r\nYume: But that's not my problem! They should all be able to take care of themselves!\r\nMaki: That's not what it means to be captain, you know.\r\nMaki: I've received some complaints from the toji you worked with. I'm going to read them now, so pay attention.\r\nMaki: --Captain Tsubakuro abandoned us in the middle of battle chasing an aradama. She didn't return for another hour.\r\nMaki: --On top of abandoning us, Captain Tsubakuro did not respond to our attempts to contact her. It was difficult to continue without being given orders.\r\nMaki: --Please, Captain Tsubakuro, I'm begging you. Don't go running off with aradama you don't know.\r\nYume: Well of course I didn't know that aradama! I don't know any aradama!\r\nYume: Besides, those girls are way too needy~! If the captain's gone, then everyone can just be their own captain!\r\nMaki: YOU COMPLETE IDIOT!!\r\nYume: Hya!?\r\nMaki: ...Even I've put people in danger by pushing too far ahead.\r\nMaki: But that's no excuse not to reflect on your mistakes. Don't try to pass your responsibility onto them.\r\nMaki: If you're going to keep putting your unit in danger, then you won't be assigned missions anymore.\r\nMaki: You always say you want everyone to remember how amazing you are, but at this rate they'll only remember you as a failure.\r\nYume: No! I don't want that!\r\nMaki: ...Everyone already knows just how strong you are, Yume. You should show them what a capable leader you can be too!\r\nYume: ...Oh... I got it!\r\nYume: Then, next time I'm in charge, I'll fight all the aradama myself! Then they'll see how capable I am!\r\nMaki: It's hard to even call that a unit at this point...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Overworking Subordinate\r\n\r\nWatanuki Kazumi: --Maki-sama. I've finished writing the report you entrusted me with. Would you like to go over it?\r\nMaki: Of course. Sorry to keep relying on you like this.\r\nKazumi: Think nothing of it. In fact, I'm grateful you would let me work on something Yukari-sama herself would read.\r\nMaki: ......Hmm. Alright, I'm done. It's very well written.\r\nKazumi: Of course. After you assigned it to me, I wouldn't settle for anything less than perfect.\r\nMaki: Thanks. You're so reliable, Kazumi.\r\nMaki: ...By the way, I couldn't help but notice the bags under your eyes. Did you have to stay up late working on this?\r\nKazumi: Please, pay it no mind. I only went one night without sleeping.\r\nMaki: You pulled an all-nighter!? There's not much left to do today, so please, go back to your room and sleep.\r\nKazumi: No, I wouldn't have had to stay up all night if not for my inexperience.\r\nMaki: ...Kazumi, don't overwork yourself. It's a bad habit of yours to push yourself harder than you have to.\r\nKazumi: No, I can still--\r\nKazumi: (I have to give everything I can. It's the only way I can be useful to Maki-sama...)\r\nKazumi: --We've been called to action. Aradama have appeared, it seems. Maki-sama, let's go.\r\nMaki: Stay here, Kazumi.\r\nMaki: If you won't rest, I'll have to punish myself for poorly managing you.\r\nKazumi: You'd punish yourself over me...\r\nKazumi: I understand. If you insist, I'll get some rest... You're so kind, Maki-sama.\r\nMaki: You're my precious subordinate, after all.\r\nMaki: Anyway, I'm going. You be sure to get some sleep in your room.\r\n\r\nKazumi: Maki-sama... I dream of one day being able to stand by your side the way Konohana-sama does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Absolute Trust\r\n\r\nMaki: --Hey, Suzuka. Have you seen my phone anywhere?\r\nSuzuka: It's over on the desk.\r\nMaki: Ah, you're right. I guess I left it in the office.\r\nSuzuka: I can't believe you... You're too careless. What if someone had taken for some wrongdoing?\r\nMaki: Wrongdoing? The only people allowed in here are those authorized by the elite guard.\r\nSuzuka: Ara, but what if I decided to play a prank on you?\r\nMaki: You wouldn't do something like that. After all the hardships we've been through together, I know I can count on you.\r\nSuzuka: --There was that time we were separated from the others and had to fight off aradama together for quite some time, wasn't there.\r\nMaki: Yeah. We didn't even have enough provisions, so we had to share a meal. I remember thinking at the time that, no matter what happened after, I could always trust you to watch my back.\r\nSuzuka: Yes. At the time, I also decided you were worth relying on as a fighter and a person.\r\nSuzuka: --On a somewhat related note. I did play a little prank on you, because of our closeness.\r\nSuzuka: After all, I know you'll forgive me, Maki-san, if I get a little mischievous with you.\r\nMaki: You shouldn't abuse someone's trust like that...\r\nSuzuka: Fufu. Anyway, are you aware I know the password to your phone?\r\nMaki: Eh-!? How!?\r\nSuzuka: You always hold your phone horizontally, so watching you input it was child's play.\r\nMaki: I-I didn't know you were watching... And hey, isn't it common courtesy not to watch someone put their password in?\r\nMaki: I mean, I don't know your phone's password, Suzuka.\r\nSuzuka: You just aren't very observant, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: That's still not a good reason...\r\nSuzuka: Anyway, jokes aside, I wanted to show how you never know what risks you may be taking.\r\nSuzuka: To begin with, an emergency call could come in at any time, so you ought to always keep your phone with you.\r\nMaki: ...You have a point there. I'll be more careful from now on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/AuF8ZqOvA9Y\r\n[VRS Equipment - Maki: Start]: Just to Be Sure\r\n\r\nYume: Found you, Maki-onee-san!\r\nMaki: Yume, what do you need? I thought you had the day off today.\r\nYume: Don't you have it off too, Maki-onee-san? Hey hey-, since we have free time, don't you want to play a game together?\r\nMaki: A game?\r\nYume: Some toji onee-sans made a VR game in their lab, and people are saying it's super fun.\r\nMaki: VR... I think I'll have to turn you down this time.\r\nYume: Ehh, you should go-. They said it's really easy to play too, so you'll be fine even though you're dumb with technology, Maki-onee-san.\r\nMaki: I-I wasn't worried about that...\r\nSuzuka: Then, Maki-san, since you have this opportunity on your day off, why not go and play with Yume?\r\nMaki: ...Doesn't seem like I have much of a choice. If you don't mind me acting as a chaperone, then I'll go.\r\nYume: Yaay! I get to go out with Maki-onee-san! That makes me happy. Let's get going then-!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: I'm surprised to see two of the elite guard arrive. It might be unexpected, but I'm glad you're here. I'll have two stations ready for you right away.\r\nMaki: Hang on a minute, I'm only here to chaperone her.\r\nYume: Ehh-, but we're already here, so you should just do it too, Maki-onee-san-!\r\nMaki: But...\r\nTsugumi: If you're concerned with the safety of it, you have nothing to worry about. Fighting within the game should be safer than your ordinary battles with aradama.\r\nMaki: Well, I can't argue with that...\r\nTsugumi: By the way, we're currently hosting an event. Whoever can score highest in the battle stage will be given a prize of cream puffs from a popular store.\r\nYume: Ahh! That's that store Suzuka-onee-san loves, isn't it! Hey hey, Maki-onee-san, if you win, then won't Suzuka-onee-san be really happy?\r\nYume: You should play for Suzuka-onee-san too-.\r\nMaki: ...I guess, if I have to. Fine, if I'm doing this, then I'll aim for the top!\r\nYume: Hooray-! Let's try our best, Maki-onee-san!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: There, now everything is ready... Hm? Shidou-san, why are you holding your okatana?\r\nMaki: Since I'm going to a strange world fighting unknown enemies, I want to take every precaution.\r\nTsugumi: I see. Though, in this game, you'll be battling with laser guns, so your okatana won't be necessary... But, if it gives you peace of mind, that's okay.\r\nTsugumi: Now then, let's start the game. Take care.\r\n\r\nYume: Wow-! So this is the game world! The city's all pretty and shiny!\r\nYume: Let's go on the roof of that building! Juuump!\r\nMaki: Yume, wait for me! Okay, I'll do it too... EII!\r\nMaki: This is amazing! The game world improved our jumping ability by this much. I can leap from building to building like I were using hachimanriki.\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san! Let's go up to the top of that tower!\r\nMaki: Sure, let's go!\r\nMaki: Ahh, the city skyline at night really is beautiful. I wish Suzuka and them could be here to see this...\r\nMaki: ...Huh? Yume? Yume, where did you go?\r\nMaki: We must have gotten separated while I was looking at the skyline.\r\nMaki: Heeey, Yume! Where are you? If you're hiding, then say something! Yume-!\r\nMaki: ...No use. She's not responding. Ban Tsugumi said it was safe here, but it's still too dangerous to explore an unknown world on your own.\r\nMaki: I need to calm down and deal with the situation. At times like this, you need to...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[VRS Equipment - Maki: End]: What Suits Me Best\r\n\r\nMaki: Heeey, Yume! Where did you go? Say something back. Yume-!\r\nMaki: Hm, that sound. The battle stage must be starting. If I follow the enemies, maybe I'll join up with Yume. I'll focus on the battle for now.\r\nMaki: If I remember right, the command to bring out the laser gun was... Okay, I got it. Now I just point it at the enemies on the opposite building...\r\nMaki: Kh, why can't I pull the trigger!? The command to pull the trigger was...\r\nMaki: Ah-- While I was working with it, the enemies got right in front of me! Damn, how should I...\r\nMaki: Ah--! That's right, I still have that, don't I! It might be tasteless of me to use my okatana in the game, but...\r\nMaki: Here I come! SERYAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nMaki: Good! I can defeat them with my okatana too. I'll keep this up and wipe them out! HAAAAAAHH!\r\nYume: Ehh-- Hey, Maki-onee-san?\r\nMaki: Yume! That's good, you're safe! I'll finish them all off in a minute! HAAAAAAHH!\r\nYume: Come on-, Maki-onee-san! It's a game, so fight with your laser gun already-.\r\nMaki: An okatana seems to be what suits me best after all. Alright, this should finish them! YAAAAAAHH!\r\nMaki: Alright, battle stage clear. Good work, Yume.\r\nYume: I wasn't working at all-. You beat them all by yourself out of nowhere, Maki-onee-san.\r\nMaki: I see, sorry about that. Anyway, how about we enjoy a look around the city now?\r\nYume: Okay!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Welcome back. Did you two have a good time?\r\nYume: Yeah! Maki-onee-san beat everything in the battle stage first, so I didn't get to do anything, but it was a lot of fun jumping around between the buildings-.\r\nMaki: It was. The virtual world was more detailed than I imagined, and it was satisfying seeing every nook and cranny of the city.\r\nTsugumi: That's good to hear. Now then, as all challengers have finished their runs, the results of the battle stage will now be revealed.\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san beat them all straight away, so there's no way she didn't take first place!\r\nMaki: That's right, I got serious hoping for that. Let's see the rankings.\r\n\r\nMaki: What!? We came in last place!?\r\nYume: Eh-!? But why? We should've been first in beating the most enemies and beating them fastest. Why are we last-?\r\nTsugumi: At first, I was just as perplexed as to why you two didn't earn any points in the battle...\r\nMirja: When investigating the cause, we came to the conclusion that there was a problem with how you defeated the enemies.\r\nTsugumi: Did you use something besides the laser gun to defeat them?\r\nMaki: Kh... So you don't get any points for defeating them with okatana...\r\n\r\nYume: We're back-!\r\nMaki: ...\r\nSuzuka: Welcome back, the two of you. Oh, Maki-san, what's the matter? That's an awfully gloomy look on your face.\r\nYume: You still can't get over that we lost, Maki-onee-san? Cheer up, okay-.\r\nMaki: Th-That's not it. It's just... I planned on coming back with Suzuka's favorite cream puffs, but instead...\r\nSuzuka: Well now, is that why you're in such low spirits. Fufu. Maki-san, please lift up your head.\r\nSuzuka: I would be happy to have those cream puffs, but your feelings alone are enough to satisfy me.\r\nMaki: Suzuka...\r\nSuzuka: Next time, I'd like for all of us to go play that game together.\r\nMaki: Right, sure thing. By that time, I'll master my way around a laser gun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/WNtGgHguxrw\r\n[SDDT - Maki: Start]: Maki of the Special Defense Team\r\n\r\nMaki: Hmph! ...Hmph!\r\nYume: Ah, I finally found you, Maki-onee-san!\r\nMaki: ...Nn? What do you need, Yume?\r\nYume: Is it true you're going on a trip alone together with Suzuka-onee-san? Why am I the only one who has to stay behind! It's boring here!\r\nMaki: Who told you something that misleading... We're not going on a trip; we're suppressing aradama.\r\nYume: That sounds even funner! You two get to do all the good stuff!\r\nMaki: Don't act so spoiled, Yume. With us having only just been reorganized into the Special Defense Team, we're short on hands.\r\nMaki: We can't afford to neglect our duty to guard the Origami family and escort Akane-sama. Do you understand what I'm saying?\r\nYume: ...Well, if I have to-.\r\nYume: But you better buy me a souvenir!! Get me an Ichigo Daifuku Neko they sell there!\r\nMaki: Got it. I'll buy you one, so long as I don't forget.\r\n\r\nMaki: ......\r\nSuzuka: Why the troubled face? How about you have a drink of tea and relax?\r\nMaki: I'll take it...\r\nSuzuka: You don't have to be so nervous. This will go fine. We only have to do it like we normally do.\r\nMaki: I'm not feeling nervous. It's just...\r\nSuzuka: Just?\r\nMaki: It's just a little hard to calm down.\r\nSuzuka: Doesn't that mean you're getting nervous?\r\nMaki: ...Maybe. I guess you're right.\r\nSuzuka: That's how you are, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: It's because we can't stop for anything until we atone for the past.\r\nSuzuka: You aren't entirely wrong to think that way, but... If you obsess over it, you'll only be making yourself suffer, alright?\r\nMaki: I know that, but, still.\r\nSuzuka: You're very serious, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: That's just how I am; I can't help it.\r\nMaki: By the way... Do you think they sell Ichigo Daifuku Nekos where the mission is taking place?\r\nSuzuka: Did Yume ask about it?\r\nMaki: Seems like she wants a souvenir.\r\nSuzuka: Of course she would.

I won't have you looking down on me.\r\nMaki: ...Let's take them all out at once!\r\nSuzuka: Understood, Maki-san!\r\n\r\nSuzuka: You saved me, back there.\r\nMaki: I only did what needed to be done.\r\nMaki: Anyway, did you look into whether they sell any Ichigo Daifuku Neko goods here?\r\nSuzuka: Why yes, of course I looked it up.\r\nMaki: Oh, that's good.\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, allow me to lead the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/-wO5Ngjj1-g\r\n[Journey to the West - Maki: Start]: A Different Way of Using It\r\n\r\nMaki: ...\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san?

But... I'm wondering if there's anything else we can use VR for.\r\nSuzuka: ...\r\nMaki: Suzuka?\r\nSuzuka: I just never expected to hear that from someone as technologically inept as you.\r\nMaki: I'll admit I'm a little bad when it comes to using gadgets. But, it's impressive, wasn't it?\r\nMaki: So it just crossed my mind.\r\nSuzuka: I do agree it's an interesting idea. I'll see if I can think of anything too.\r\n\r\nMaki: A PV?\r\nSuzuka: Yes. A promotional video for toji, with a play staged in VR.\r\nMaki: A play...?\r\nSuzuka: I called it that, but we won't actually be acting out roles.\r\nSuzuka: Something more of a staged sword fight, you could call it.\r\nSuzuka: When I consulted with Ban-san, she said it would be feasible, so long as she recorded the fighting and edited the footage.\r\nMaki: So she just needs us to fight then... Alright, that plan sounds good.\r\nMaki: We should be able to make it happen.\r\nSuzuka: I've already given Ban-san the go ahead.\r\nMaki: You always get things rolling. Let's go see Ban Tsugumi then.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Come to visit?\r\nMaki: Yeah. Is everything coming along?\r\nTsugumi: I have it ready for you.\r\nTsugumi: Just for a test, the current configuration is set to \"Journey to the West\"; will that be an issue?\r\nMaki: Not at all.\r\nMaki: We just need to play characters from Journey to the West, right?\r\nTsugumi: That's the case.\r\nTsugumi: Were there any you wanted to play in particular? If not, I can assign you to what fits.\r\nSuzuka: That would be fine. We'll be in your care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Journey to the West - Maki: End]: We'll All Do It Next Time\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Now then, we'll begin the action. Is everyone ready?\r\nMaki: No problems here. What about you, Suzuka?\r\nSuzuka: I'm fine as well.\r\nTsugumi: Then, I'll introduce enemies. They'll begin moving as soon as you start, so please bear that in mind.\r\nMaki: Sure, we've got it.\r\nMaki: Alright, let's start...\r\nSuzuka: One thing before that, Maki-san. Should we go over how we plan to fight?\r\nMaki: How? Aren't we going to fight like normal?\r\nSuzuka: There wouldn't be much appeal in that. Given that we're in VR, I think we should use this opportunity to fight differently.\r\nMaki: Differently from normal...\r\nTsugumi: If I can collect different combat data than your ordinary battles, I'd very much welcome that too.\r\nMaki: Alright, I'll try coming up with something. How about, using the buildings to fight?\r\nMaki: Suzuka.\r\nSuzuka: To move about three-dimensionally? It sounds interesting.\r\nMaki: We're going to move up to the top of this building, so start whenever you feel the timing's right.\r\n\r\nMaki: Yoh, hoh!\r\nVillain: !!\r\nMaki: Spotted the enemy! Suzuka!\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san!?\r\nMaki: HAAAH!!\r\nVillain: ...\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san, you're moving around too haphazardly...\r\nMaki: Sorry about that. I could just move my body so freely I couldn't help it.\r\nSuzuka: Did it give you any nausea? \r\nMaki: My vision's spinning around... I think I might be a little motion sick.\r\nSuzuka: Ban-san, let's take a short break.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: I've finished recording the fight scene as we planned.\r\nTsugumi: This here is a sample of it. Please watch over it to decide whether or not we should make a PV from it.\r\nMaki: Sure, I'll give it a watch. Thanks too; this was a good experience.\r\n\r\nSeveral days later.\r\n\r\nYume: This is so cool-! It's like you onee-sans are really fighting around in Journey to the West!\r\nYume: And actually, that's no fair! I want to do that too! I want to film a whole bunch of me being cool!\r\nMaki: Sure. Then, next time, let's all do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/f98LI_s4H4M\r\n[Xmas' 20 - Maki: Start]: Looking for a Christmas Cake\r\n\r\nMaki: ...\r\nMaki: ............\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san, how long're you planning on doing this for-?\r\nMaki: Just give me a little longer, Yume.\r\nMaki: This cake has to be a Christmas cake, but at the same time it also has to be Yomi's birthday cake.\r\nMaki: Finding a cake that Yomi'll like... It's tough.\r\nYume: Oh, okay.\r\nMaki: Thinking about what Yomi likes, there's omusubi, but...\r\nYume: Then, can't we just go with a rice cake?\r\nMaki: A rice cake... That's true; with a name like that, Yomi'd probably like it.\r\nMaki: Okay, let's buy one!\r\n\r\nMaki: This isn't good, Suzuka!\r\nSuzuka: What's the matter?\r\nMaki: Rice cakes aren't actually cakes!\r\nSuzuka: That's right, they aren't?\r\nMaki: ...You knew about that?\r\nSuzuka: Yes. If you look up the word rice cake, you'll find mochi...\r\nSuzuka: That isn't what you ordered, is it, Maki-san?\r\nMaki: Yeah. What I got was something like puffed up rice in a disc shape.\r\nSuzuka: That sounds about right.\r\nSuzuka: Honestly, why would you order something like that?\r\nMaki: I thought it'd make Yomi happy, as a Christmas cake...\r\nSuzuka: What am I going to do with you.\r\nSuzuka: Rice cakes are something you can eat like crackers.\r\nSuzuka: All we can do now is prepare a different cake for Yomi-san's birthday.\r\nSuzuka: Fortunately, we still have time to spare.\r\nMaki: Oh yeah... You're right.\r\nMaki: I'll look for another cake Yomi'll be happy with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Xmas' 20 - Maki: Start]: With a Special Someone\r\n\r\nMaki: Still though, a different cake... What can I get?\r\nEllen: Makimaki! You look like something's bothering you; what're you up to?\r\nMaki: Kohagura? Actually...\r\n\r\nEllen: I see, so you're worried over what to get for Yomiyomi's birthday cake.\r\nEllen: In that case, there's a shop I can recommend to you!\r\nMaki: Really!?\r\nEllen: Yes! It's been my favorite lately!\r\nMaki: That sounds reliable.\r\nEllen: Though, I'll give you a bit of advice. I'm sure that, whatever cake you get for her, Yomiyomi will be happy.\r\nMaki: ...Could you tell me why you think that?\r\nEllen: Anyone would be happy with whatever someone tried so hard to pick out for them.\r\nMaki: ...\r\nMaki: You're right; maybe I've been overthinking this a little. I'll pay that cake shop a visit.\r\nEllen: I hope it'll make your Christmas Day wonderful!\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve.\r\n\r\nMaki: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nAradama: ...\r\nWatanuki Kazumi: Maki-sama!\r\nKazumi: There's no more readings on the spectrum finder. That aradama seems to have been the last of them.\r\nMaki: Alright... Good work, everybody.\r\nTojis: Right!\r\nMaki: It's Christmas Eve. Some of you must have plans.\r\nMaki: You should spend the rest of the night with the people special to you.\r\nTojis: Okay!!\r\n\r\nKazumi: Err, Maki-sama, do you have any plans for later...? If you wouldn't mind...\r\nMaki: I have to be at a Christmas and birthday party for Yomi.\r\nKazumi: ...I see then.\r\nKazumi: I hope you'll enjoy yourself!\r\nMaki: Thanks, Kazumi. I hope you'll have a good Christmas Eve too.\r\nKazumi: ...Right!"}, {"paste_key": "8nKHxKWZ", "title": "Konohana Suzuka Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/8nKHxKWZ", "timestamp": "", "hits": "106", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2NeeHf2gB0\r\nhttps://youtu.be/MB7eNdGUsHU\r\nhttps://youtu.be/gTpQZtWj_rg\r\nhttps://youtu.be/t74NJwnCerI\r\n\r\n1: Dance of the Ojou-samas\r\n\r\nMai: Good to see you, Konohana-san.\r\nSuzuka: And you as well, Yanase-san. It's been quite some time since we met at a social gathering.\r\nMai: That's true. Lately, I've been spending more time on battlefields... Are you here accompanying your father as well, Konohana-san?\r\nSuzuka: Yes, networking is invaluable, after all. Meetings like this allow you to keep up with many people.\r\nSuzuka: And deepening your connections is never a waste.\r\nSuzuka: For the sake of the Konohana family, and more precisely, for my own sake.\r\nMai: You've always had your act together. Compared to you, I--\r\nWoman: Kyaaaaa--!! L-Look outside; an aradama!!\r\nSuzuka: What was that!?\r\nMai: What's it doing out here...?\r\nSuzuka: We can think about that later. First, we need to destroy that aradama. Will you help me?\r\nMai: Yes, of course!\r\nSuzuka: Then, we shouldn't waste time. Let's show this aradama where it's not welcome.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Nicely done. Thankfully, we were able to deal with this before it became a serious incident.\r\nMai: I ended up on another battlefield, in the end.\r\nSuzuka: You're right, now that you mention it. Perhaps that's the fate of us toji.\r\nSuzuka: But, leaving that aside, you were about to say something strange before we were interrupted, weren't you?\r\nMai: Something strange? Sorry, I don't really remember?\r\nSuzuka: \"You've always had your act together. Compared to you, I--\".\r\nSuzuka: Surely you don't mean to imply you haven't been an accomplished person yourself?\r\nMai: I'm not implying anything; that's just how it is...\r\nSuzuka: That joke isn't as funny as you think.\r\nSuzuka: There aren't many who could repeat the way you handled your okatana just now.\r\nSuzuka: That beautiful swordsmanship could only belong to one who thoroughly dedicated herself to training every day.\r\nSuzuka: Therefore, please have more confidence in yourself. Your worries only weaken your resolve.\r\nMai: Konohana-san... Thank you very much.\r\nSuzuka: You don't need to thank me.\r\nSuzuka: Now then... The party seems to still be open. I should take my leave.\r\nSuzuka: Farewell, Yanase-san. Until we meet on another battlefield.\r\nMai: Yes! Until we fight together again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Ojou-sama is a Commoner\r\n\r\nMaki: What are you having for lunch, Suzuka?\r\nSuzuka: As for me, I've prepared this.\r\nMaki: That's... Another convenience store bento? How many days in a row is that?\r\nSuzuka: Unfortunately for you, that's wrong. This isn't a convenience store bento, but rather a bento from the supermarket's deli corner.\r\nSuzuka: And would you look at this, right here! I found it at a 30% discount! Such great value, isn't it?\r\nMaki: The ojou-sama is bragging about bargain bin deals...\r\nSuzuka: I can't overlook that. I've never once thought of myself as an ojou-sama, you know.\r\nMaki: If you aren't one, then what even is an ojou-sama?\r\nMaki: I've heard rumors that, in middle school, you rode in a different luxury car to school every day.\r\nSuzuka: ...? What's so strange about that?\r\nMaki: So it's true!? Why would you change cars every day? And luxury cars too!\r\nSuzuka: I'm sorry? You're the one saying strange things now. You change clothing every day, don't you? Why would cars be any different?\r\nMaki: Of course it's different!! Don't compare cars costing tens of millions of yen to clothes...!\r\nSuzuka: But outfits costing several tens of millions of yen aren't all that uncommon, are they?\r\nMaki: Your sense of money's insane... That reminds me. There's another rumor you were running late one day, so you had a helicopter airlift you to school.\r\nSuzuka: That's a misunderstanding. Even I've never flown in a helicopter to school.\r\nMaki: It figures, that one's just idle gossip...\r\nSuzuka: Yes, a helicopter wouldn't have made it in time. I rode a Harrier instead.\r\nMaki: Isn't that a fighter jet!? I knew it; you're an ojou-sama among ojou-samas.\r\nSuzuka: But I think I'm fairly ordinary, though?\r\nMaki: Do I even want to know your definition of ordinary...?\r\nMaki: Still, I'm surprised you not only go to convenience stores, but supermarkets too. Or do you have someone get these for you?\r\nSuzuka: I'd never have someone do that for me. You must not be aware, Maki-san. Of how wonderful the supermarket is.\r\nSuzuka: The shelves are brimming with an endless variety of foods, and simply browsing through their collection of sweets is a joy.\r\nSuzuka: There's so much to see that I could spend half a day there without losing interest in the slightest.\r\nSuzuka: Ah, I know! If you'd like, will you join me next time? I can guide you around.\r\nMaki: S-Sure...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Suzuka's Duties\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Excellent work. I'd expect no less from you, Yukari-sama. Even while negotiating with such veteran ministers, you didn't give an inch. It was a valuable learning experience.\r\nYukari: With this, we should be able to act more freely. Another step toward my ideal.\r\nYukari: We can begin as soon as this bill takes effect. I'll need you working harder than ever from here.\r\nSuzuka: I'm well aware. I'll gladly do everything I can to make your plans a reality, Yukari-sama.\r\nMan: .........\r\nSuzuka: What are you doing? Clear the way, you're being disrespectful.\r\nMan: ORIGAMIIIII!!\r\nYukari: Hm, an insurgent?\r\nSuzuka: I won't allow it.\r\nMan: GYAAAHH!!\r\nSuzuka: Don't worry, I merely used the back of the blade. I wouldn't dirty Kujikanesada with the blood of a common rebel, after all.\r\nSuzuka: Honestly, for one as helpless as you to make an attempt on Yukari-sama's life was hopelessly naive.\r\nSuzuka: With an overambitious plan, someone must have put you up to it, didn't they?\r\nSuzuka: Prepare yourself. I'll have you tell me everything.\r\nMan: ....Ghkhg!!\r\nSuzuka: Wha!? What are you doing!?\r\nMan: .........\r\nSuzuka: He's dead... It seems he prepared a suicide capsule in the back of his teeth.\r\nSuzuka: This is inexcusable. To have lost such a valuable witness right from under me... Yukari-sama, I'll accept any punishment you give.\r\nYukari: There's no need. I have no interest in every insect crawling the ground in my way.\r\nYukari: As my desires are realized, many more like him will be flushed out. They're not all worth my attention. Leave him where he lies.\r\nSuzuka: ...Understood.\r\nYukari: Now then, come with me.\r\nSuzuka: Yes! Wherever you go, I will be at your side!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Time we Spent Together\r\n\r\nMaki: What's the matter; your attacks are getting softer. Tired already?\r\nSuzuka: Funny, coming from you. Your footwork is already slipping, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: Now you've said it. How about this!?\r\nSuzuka: Kuh...! How much longer can you go on!\r\nSuzuka: Hah--!!\r\nMaki: Oh, that was a good strike. For practice, you're sure coming at me with a lot of passion. Reminds me of when we first met!\r\nSuzuka: And you're taking this awfully casually, to go reminiscing about the past!\r\nMaki: That's not true. I'm barely holding my ground.\r\nSuzuka: (She's always grinning like that. Back then, I hated that smile from the bottom of my heart.)\r\nSuzuka: (Maki-san's okatana, \"Usumidori\", is of special importance to practitioners of Kurama-Ryu. I was deeply jealous of her.)\r\nSuzuka: (\"Usumidori\" was much more suited to be mine. I challenged her in the tournament, intending to prove that, but it ended in my defeat.)\r\nSuzuka: (With my pride deeply wounded, my spite for her only grew stronger. I swore I would someday surpass her.)\r\nSuzuka: (I even followed her as far as joining the elite guard.)\r\nMaki: What are you smiling about?\r\nSuzuka: Smiling? I was?\r\nMaki: Yeah. I couldn't believe it myself, but while you were fighting so passionately you had such a gentle smile on your face.\r\nMaki: Seriously, you're the one taking this casually, aren't you?\r\nSuzuka: I was simply reflecting on the past a little, is all.\r\nMaki: The past? I must not be a serious opponent for you, if you can happily walk down memory lane in the middle of a fight.\r\nSuzuka: Isn't that the case for you, Maki-san? You've done nothing but win against me lately. You have to be taking me lightly by now.\r\nMaki: Suzuka, to me you're a close friend I know I can rely on. But at the same time, I see you as my rival.\r\nMaki: Every day I'm trying desperately not to be outdone by you. You never give me a spare moment to take you lightly.\r\nSuzuka: ...!? You're always going on like that... Then, today's the day I overtake you!\r\nMaki: Not going to happen. Even in practice, you're the one person I never want to lose to!\r\nSuzuka: That's what I wanted to say! Regardless of anyone else, I have no intention of giving you an easy victory!\r\nSuzuka: Yah---!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: The One at Your Side\r\n\r\nNaeba Wakako: Suzuka-sama, isn't it about time we took a rest?\r\nWakako: The sight of you at work is lovely enough to touch my heart, but without rest your body will start to suffer.\r\nWakako: If your body were to give out on you... I wouldn't be able to go on living!\r\nSuzuka: You're always so dramatic. But, I do happen to be at a good stopping point. Let's pause here for now.\r\nWakako: Suzuka-sama, um, here... Try these, if it suits you.\r\nSuzuka: My, what delicious looking tarts. Just look at how the fruits are glistening. Where did you find these?\r\nWakako: There's a shop I often see featured in magazines; they made them. Actually, these tarts are so famous they regularly sell out the moment the shop opens.\r\nSuzuka: Really? You did well in getting them then.\r\nWakako: Yes, I was waiting in line since three this morning!\r\nSuzuka: Y-You arrived that early?\r\nWakako: I worked my hardest to ensure you could eat them, Suzuka-sama!\r\nSuzuka: I appreciate your dedication, but there's no need to go to such unreasonable lengths. It would be a serious issue if you came down ill as a result.\r\nWakako: Suzuka-sama is worried about me... My heart feels like it could leap from my chest! I think I could live the rest of my life on those words alone!\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, you sure love to exaggerate.\r\nMaki: Sorry to interrupt. Suzuka, I brought orders for you.\r\nSuzuka: Ara, Maki-san, you didn't have to come all this way to deliver them.\r\nMaki: It's a part of the job; don't worry about it. I skimmed over it earlier. Our next mission seems fairly challenging.\r\nSuzuka: Ara, are you losing your nerve? Don't worry, I'll cover your share of the work if you need me.\r\nMaki: Who said anything like that!? I only wanted to warn you it looks difficult! It won't be a problem for me!\r\nSuzuka: Is that so? In any case, you can always depend on me being there to support you.\r\nMaki: That's what I should be saying...\r\nWakako: ...I'm really not fit to be the one standing at Suzuka-sama's side, am I. She looks so much more splendid together with Maki-sama...\r\nSuzuka: Hm? Were you saying something, Wakako?\r\nWakako: N-N-No! Pay no attention to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Bride '19: Start]: Undercover Investigation (Suzuka's Case)\r\n\r\nMaki: An undercover investigation?\r\nSuzuka: Yes, we will be going undercover.\r\nSuzuka: Another report has come in from that wedding chapel of an aradama stealing a wedding ring.\r\nMaki: Which means, someone will have to dress like a bride to lure the aradama out?\r\nMaki: Should we defeat the aradama there though? Shouldn't we work to get the stolen ring back?\r\nSuzuka: No, we have a ring equipped with a transmitter, so we only need the aradama to steal it.\r\nMaki: I see, that makes sense.\r\nMaki: So you'll be the bride, the aradama will steal the ring, we track where it goes, and this will all be solved.\r\nSuzuka: Eh!?\r\nMaki: Did I get something wrong?\r\nSuzuka: N-No... Only, I'll be the bride? The members from the previous mission have all been gathered...\r\nMaki: Of course, if there's a chance you'll be in danger, I'll be right there to protect you. But wouldn't it be best if we were the ones doing the dangerous work?\r\nSuzuka: Y-You do have a point.\r\nMaki: And besides, instead of someone like me, you'd make a much more convincing bride, Suzuka.\r\nSuzuka: V-Very well then. I'll play the bride to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: There, I've put it on. Hopefully it can convince the aradama I'm a true bride...\r\nSuzuka: (Nonetheless... The design of this wedding dress is exquisite.)\r\nSuzuka: ...Does it suit me, I wonder?\r\nSuzuka: Even though I should be accustomed to wearing dresses... It's strange. I'm feeling slightly nervous.\r\nSuzuka: ...Fu.\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san? ...I've finished changing.\r\nSuzuka: ...Maki-san?\r\nChapel Staff: Oh, if you're looking for Shidou-san, she said she would patrol the chapel while you get changed.\r\nSuzuka: How typical of her.\r\nSuzuka: It would be a waste to wait for her return, so I'll go on patrol as well.\r\nChapel Staff: Of course, please do.\r\nSuzuka: ...May I ask you something?\r\nChapel Staff: What's that?\r\nSuzuka: ...This doesn't look strange on me, does it?\r\nChapel Staff: No, it's a perfect fit.\r\nSuzuka: Thank you very much... Don't tell anyone I asked that, will you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Bride '19: End]: You're Late, You know?\r\n\r\nSuzuka: I said I would search for Maki-san, but it's difficult to cover such a large area.\r\nSuzuka: Oh? Over there, that's... Yomi-san, Ban-san. So you two were stationed here.\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nTsugumi: Satsuki-san, shouldn't you say something more? On average, brides enjoy compliments.\r\nYomi: You look very nice, Konohana-san.\r\nSuzuka: Well, I do appreciate the flattery.\r\nSuzuka: But more importantly, have either of you seen Maki-san around?\r\nTsugumi: Shidou-san? I haven't seen her.\r\nYomi: I spoke with her a little about our patrols.\r\nSuzuka: How long ago was that?\r\nYomi: Only a few minutes ago. She went to look for where security was light.\r\nSuzuka: Light security... Thank you, Yomi-san.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: If she went to where there was little security, this should be a likely area...\r\nKiyoka: Oh, Konohana-sa... Wow, that's so pretty.\r\nEllen: Hanahana, you look amazing in that wedding dress!\r\nEllen: I wish I could wear one too!\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, thank you. Have you seen Maki-san around?\r\nEllen: Makimaki was right here with us until a moment ago. I think she's still nearby!\r\nKiyoka: Ah! You want Shidou-san to see you in your wedding dress, don't you!\r\nSuzuka: All I want is to perform our mission, which I need to find her for.\r\nSuzuka: ...Musumi-san? We mustn't confuse our private interests with our duties.\r\nKiyoka: I-I'm sorry.\r\nSuzuka: Please focus your attention on securing the area, will you?\r\n\r\nSuzuka: ...Really now, it's all because Musumi-san had to say something strange that I'm somewhat nervous again... Ah.\r\nMaki: ......\r\nSuzuka: ...! M-Maki-san?\r\nMaki: Oh, Suzuka. Looks like you're done getting changed.\r\nSuzuka: Y-Yes.\r\nMaki: There's been no sign of anything here. The spectrum finder hasn't responded either, so it doesn't seem like the aradama is around.\r\nSuzuka: ...\r\nMaki: Suzuka?\r\nSuzuka: Ah, it's nothing... Its target must be the ring after all.\r\nMaki: That's right, we should get it ready now.\r\nSuzuka: Yes.\r\nSuzuka: (Honestly, why did I expect anything more from Maki-san... I feel like a fool for ever getting nervous.)\r\nMaki: Suzuka?\r\nSuzuka: I'll have the ring ready in a moment. The other toji have taken their positions, so we can start...\r\nMaki: No, I didn't mean that... You look good.\r\nSuzuka: Ah... Fufu, I'm glad to hear that, Maki-san.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/MB7eNdGUsHU\r\n[Valentines Suzuka: Start]: A Similar Pair?\r\n\r\nMirja: As of now, there is only one more confirmed target in the shopping mall. Do you see it on the spectrum finder?\r\nAradama: ...Ggii.\r\nSuzuka: There it is.\r\nSuzuka: (Rather than giving chase now with the two of us, it would be more effective to form a pincer attack. If these aradama are truly after the chocolate, then it shouldn't run to the other floors, but instead to the food court.)\r\nSuzuka: (There is only one route it can take to there. Our strategy should be for Kitora Mirja to circle around, and--)\r\nMirja: I'll circle around to the food court! Konohana Suzuka, you drive the aradama forward. As a precaution, I'll contact Kohagura and Tsubakuro as I move.\r\nSuzuka: !\r\nSuzuka: Good, I won't object to that.\r\nSuzuka: Destroying them is most important, however--\r\nAradama: ...GGGIII-!\r\nSuzuka: It won't make it so easy, will it.\r\nSuzuka: Though, even if you run, I'll guide your every move.\r\n\r\nAradama: GSHAA---!\r\nMirja: Just as planned. It's coming directly here.\r\nMirja: However, I won't so lenient as to let such a mindless charge through!\r\nSuzuka: Well done.\r\nMirja: Bringing it down was nothing. You had the more difficult role of guiding it here.\r\nSuzuka: It might have been on the run, but that aradama would have only gone to where the chocolate is located, so it was hardly a challenge.\r\nMirja: I see. Though, shouldn't you have been able to bring that aradama down?\r\nSuzuka: There are many things left unconfirmed about these aradama, so I decided to rely on the more certain method of a pincer attack. If you hadn't proposed the idea, I would have.\r\nSuzuka: I realize we are operating in two man teams during this mission, but it's been simple to carry out with how clear each other's intentions are.\r\nMirja: I felt the same. I can follow on your sensible instructions without hesitation. The elite guard must operate very smoothly.\r\nSuzuka: I never give detailed instructions to the elite guard.\r\nSuzuka: The primary role of the elite guard is to escort Yukari-sama, so when carrying out large scale operations, I and Maki-san will take command of our own units.\r\nMirja: Now that you mention it, that is certainly true. Hm...\r\nMirja: While we are on the topic of the elite guard, what sort of person is Shidou Maki? How do you see her?\r\nSuzuka: Eh? W-What do... you mean by that...?\r\nMirja: I have somewhat of an interest in Shidou Maki myself.\r\nMirja: I'm not sure if you are aware, but in the tournament the year before last, I was defeated by her.\r\nMirja: As I see her, she is a straightforward toji with a single-minded strength. Every one of her strikes had great force behind it.\r\nMirja: However, as someone who is close at her side, I was wondering if you had a different impression.\r\nSuzuka: Is that all you meant. Though, I don't think my impression differs much from yours? There's no hidden side to speak of when it comes to Maki-san.\r\nSuzuka: Well, if I had to name something, she can be quite dense at times.\r\nMirja: Is that so? She doesn't at all give that impression when fighting.\r\nMirja: Thank you for answering such a trivial question of mine.\r\nSuzuka: It was nothing. Now then, why don't we make our way back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Valentines Suzuka: End]: The Reason Behind Her Enthusiasm\r\n\r\nPatissier: Sure, that would be fine. I can teach you some relatively simple tricks to making delicious chocolate even at home.\r\nSuzuka: Thank you very much. It won't be an issue for you to teach them to me, will it?\r\nPatissier: Well, it shouldn't be a problem so long as you don't go spreading online that it was our shop that taught it to you.\r\nPatissier: We're very grateful to all you toji. You're spending your spare time helping us, aren't you?\r\nPatissier: It's probably because you're all so cute, but we're selling more chocolate this year than usual.\r\nSuzuka: Well now. In that case, I'll gladly learn what you have to teach me.\r\nPatissier: Then, we can do it after we close up for the day. But, you must be tired from your duties, so don't push yourself, okay?\r\nSuzuka: Of course; thank you for your concern.\r\nEllen: We're back-! I had a pretty exciting experience, fighting with Yumecchi out there.\r\nYume: Really? I was just fighting like I normally do~.\r\nEllen: You were really leading the way with how we were fighting before. It seems like anyone would have a hard time keeping up with you.\r\nYume: Ah, now that we're here, I wanna eat some cake!\r\nEllen: That's a good idea! I'm a little hungry myself.\r\nYume: What should I have today~? Mont blanc? Or pudding a la mode... Mmm, I think I'll go with the strawberry rare cheesecake after all~.\r\nSuzuka: Strawberry is one of your favorites, isn't it, Yume. You like Ichigo Daifuku Neko as well, don't you?\r\nYume: Yeah, I guess it is~.\r\nSuzuka: Once you've finished eating, can I count on you to help us with managing the shop?\r\nSuzuka: I'll go ahead and get changed first.\r\nYume: Sure sure-. You don't have to worry about me-.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Thank you very much for your order. We hope to see you again.\r\nYume: Thank you very much~...\r\nYume: Suzuka-onee-san, is it me, or are you acting extra excited today?\r\nSuzuka: I don't think that's the case? This is how I always am.\r\nYume: Ehh, but I feel like something's different for sure-. Ah, maybe you got a special kind of cake!\r\nSuzuka: If I had gotten a cake like that, I would have shared it with you, Yume.\r\nYume: Hmm, I guess you would've. Then maybe I imagined it? But still...\r\nSuzuka: (I should have expected no less from Yume... She's so perceptive when it comes to the strangest things. I think it would be fine to tell her about being taught the tricks to making chocolate though.)\r\nSuzuka: (But, until Valenties day, I cannot allow Maki-san to find out.)\r\nSuzuka: (I'm only erring on the side of caution. Sorry, Yume.)\r\nSuzuka: (I'm sure the store's products would be more delicious, but I'm a bit interested in seeing Maki-san's reaction when I tell the chocolates I gave her are homemade.)\r\nSuzuka: Though, it is Maki-san after all. I'm sure she's no stranger to homemade chocolate.\r\nYume: What's that about Maki-onee-san?\r\nSuzuka: Nothing at all. It isn't much longer until closing time, so let's give one last effort.\r\nYume: You really are acting kinda suspicious today, Suzuka-onee-san~...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/gTpQZtWj_rg\r\n[Xmas' 19 - Suzuka: Start]: A Place to Hide a Present\r\n\r\nMaki: Suzuka, did something happen for you to call me over here?\r\nSuzuka: I'm sorry to do this when things are so busy at the end of the year. But actually, I'd like to discuss something with you.\r\nMaki: Discuss what?\r\nSuzuka: It's about the birthday present we bought for Yomi-san the other day.\r\nMaki: Oh yeah. We picked out a great present thanks to you. I'm looking forward to surprising her with it. But, what about it?\r\nSuzuka: You see, I had hidden it in the back of the record room so that Yomi-san wouldn't find it until the 24th...\r\nMaki: Don't tell me she found it!?\r\nSuzuka: No, I was able to retrieve it just in time, but Yomi-san' intuition is sharp. I'm not quite sure how to keep it a secret until the day of.\r\nMaki: I get it. You're right, that's an important discussion to have.\r\nSuzuka: To begin with, anywhere we can enter, Yomi-san freely enters as well...\r\nMaki: And if we kept it in our living quarters, Yume would likely find it whenever she comes in to play around.\r\nSuzuka: In previous years, we prepared it together with Yume, so the three of us could have kept it a secret between us.\r\nMaki: But she went and said she'd do something on her own this year. I want to keep it secret from Yume too if possible...\r\nYomi: Konohana-san, you were in here?\r\nSuzuka: Y-Yomi-san! Hadn't you gone off on an assignment?\r\nYomi: I was called in by Yukari-sama. I'm supposed to bring you with me as well.\r\nSuzuka: Yukari-sama asked for you and myself? Very well then. We can leave in a moment. Though...\r\nMaki: I'll take care of the present for now. If you think of a good place to store it, send me a message.\r\nSuzuka: Alright then. Do your best to keep it a secret.\r\n\r\nYukari: Konohana, Satsuki, the two of you will be undertaking a special mission.\r\nSuzuka: I understand. Ask us to do whatever is needed.\r\nYomi: Yes, whatever the mission entails, we will carry it out flawlessly.\r\nYukari: Those are encouraging responses. Your mission is set to take place on December 25th.\r\nYukari: Dressed in Santa Claus outfits, I want you to visit locations where the local children gather and distribute presents prepared by the Origami family.\r\nSuzuka/Yomi: Eh...?\r\nYukari: What, are you dissatisfied with that?\r\nSuzuka: Not at all; I think it's a wonderful idea! Yukari-sama, thank you for offering us this lovely mission.\r\nYomi: So long as you order it, I'll tend to it quickly, Yukari-sama.\r\nYukari: The presents have already been set aside in the storehouse. I leave it to you to decide how to distribute them. Is that clear?\r\nSuzuka: Yes ma'am!\r\n\r\nYomi: There's a mountain of presents...\r\nSuzuka: Would you look at that! Each of them is so neatly wrapped; just the sight of it gives me a thrill!\r\nYomi: Does it...\r\nSuzuka: They're all so cute, and yet you don't seem interested in the slightest, Yomi-san...\r\nSuzuka: Ahh! That's right! I could try that!\r\nYomi: Konohana-san? Is something wrong?\r\nSuzuka: (Fufu, I've come up with an excellent idea of how to hide Yomi-san's present.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Xmas' 19 - Suzuka: End]: Present For You\r\n\r\nDecember 25th.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Merry Christmas, to all you good girls and boys! These are presents from the Origami family. Please, come right up and have one~.\r\nBoy 1: Ehh-! Can I really have one?\r\nChild's Mother: Thank you very much.\r\nBoy 2: Santa-onee-san! Please give me a present too!\r\nGirl 1: Me too-!\r\nSuzuka: Oh my, we're completely surrounded by children now. Yomi-san, are you alright over there?\r\nYomi: .........\r\nYomi: Will all the children please calm down. Plenty of presents have been prepared. They will be distributed as quickly as we are able, so please form a line and stand silently for your turn.\r\nSuzuka: Yomi-san! If you use such difficult words, you won't get through to them.\r\nYomi: I'm sorry. I'm unused to working with children...\r\nSuzuka: There's no helping that then. Yomi-san, I'll give an example of what to do, so try mimicking me to start. Here I go.\r\nSuzuka: If any of our little friends would like a present, please line up in front of us onee-sans~!\r\nChildren: Okaaay!\r\nYomi: I see, bring yourself down to their level, and speak plainly to them... I'll try it.\r\nYomi: Everyone, if you want a present, please line up. Will everyone who wants a present please line up.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: All the presents were peacefully handed out. You did well, Yomi-san.\r\nYomi: ......\r\nSuzuka: Are you feeling too tired to have much to say? Though, because of your efforts today, you brought happiness to plenty of children.\r\nYomi: Do you think so?\r\nSuzuka: I do. And that Santa bag you're holding is the proof of it. Isn't the inside filled with objects of their gratitude?\r\nYomi: Yes; letters, drawings, candies, and chocolate. I never expected them to give me so many gifts in return.\r\nSuzuka: With this, we should be able to give a good report to Yukari-sama.\r\nYomi: That's true.\r\nYomi: By the way, Konohana-san. You've been carefully holding onto one present for a while now. Did you forget to distribute it?\r\nYomi: Our mission today was to deliver every last one of the presents. We should hurry and find a child to deliver it to.\r\nSuzuka: There won't be any need for that. This here is Maki-san and my birthday present to you, Yomi-san.\r\nYomi: For... me?\r\nSuzuka: With all the confusion surrounding the party and our missions, we ended up a day late, but Yomi-san, we wish you a happy birthday.\r\nYomi: Konohana-san...\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, and I'll take a photo of the moment of our successful surprise. Maki-san on her expedition assignment should be glad to see this.\r\nYomi: Thank you for your gift. I'm grateful for your thoughtfulness.\r\nSuzuka: You're very perceptive, Yomi-san, so we were anxious you might find your present before we could give it to you.\r\nSuzuka: We were very lucky to keep it a secret until today. I suppose you hide a tree in a forest, and a present among gifts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/t74NJwnCerI\r\n[Special Defense Team - Suzuka: Start]: Suzuka of the Special Defense Team\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Now then, I'll go about explaining our next mission.\r\nMaki: We're suppressing aradama, right?\r\nSuzuka: Yes, it will be a bit of a trip. It's been some time since you and I took an assignment together, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: With both of us, it'd be extremely unlikely anything goes wrong, but... It hasn't been long since we were put in the special defense team.\r\nMaki: Let's keep ourselves focused.\r\nSuzuka: Of course.\r\nSuzuka: Even seen favorably, the special defense team is simply a re-organizing of the old Origami family elite guard.\r\nSuzuka: There are still those keeping a harsh eye on us now, so all we can do is to continue producing results.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: I don't see any... responses to aradama.\r\nMaki: Doesn't seem like there's any around here. If we had Yomi with us right about now...\r\nSuzuka: She would have found them easily.\r\nSuzuka: Yet...\r\nSuzuka: Though we were re-assembled directly under Akane-sama... If the four of us were to be acting together, it would invite needless suspicion.\r\nSuzuka: We need to endure it for the time being.\r\nMaki: We can't let pointless gossip make Yukari-sama's situation worse than it already is.\r\nMaki: ...I'm going to hang around here a little longer. What about you, Suzuka?\r\nSuzuka: Let's see... We should rest for the night.\r\nMaki: Got it. You go on back first, Suzuka.\r\nSuzuka: No, you'll be coming back with me, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: If you're worried about me, don't be. An aradama's not going to get the better of me just because I lost one night of sleep.\r\nSuzuka: I believe you. But, what if it's two nights instead of one? What if we still haven't found the aradama then?\r\nSuzuka: Do you plan on keeping yourself awake all this time?\r\nMaki: Then I'll...\r\nSuzuka: It would be too much, even for you. Wouldn't it, Maki-san?\r\nSuzuka: If all you do is stretch yourself thin, you'll break in no time.\r\nMaki: ...You're right. Alright, Suzuka.\r\nMaki: I'll go rest too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Special Defense Team - Suzuka: End]: In Harmony\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Nn...\r\nSuzuka: (It's still dark out, and yet I'm awake now... Oh?)\r\nSuzuka: (Maki-san is looking outside...?)\r\nMaki: ......\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san?\r\nMaki: Suzuka... Did I wake you?\r\nSuzuka: You didn't... What time is it now?\r\nMaki: It just turned five.\r\nSuzuka: Not much longer till the sunrise then.\r\nSuzuka: Nnnh......! Have you been up like this the whole time?\r\nMaki: No, I only just got up myself. If I didn't sleep properly, somebody'd get mad at me.\r\nSuzuka: Oh my, is there someone so frightening as to get angry with the former first seat of the elite guard?\r\nMaki: Yeah, she's always around. It's a real help.\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san!\r\nMaki: Suzuka, get ready quick! We're leaving!\r\n\r\nSuzuka: YAAH!\r\nAradama: OOOOoooo...\r\nMaki: There's more than expected... HAAH!!\r\nSuzuka: We made the right choice to get a good night's rest.\r\nMaki: That's for sure.\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san, feel free to move as you please. I'll stay with you and cover your blind spot.\r\nMaki: I'll be fine if you move freely yourself, Suzuka. I can at least tell where your blind spot is.\r\nSuzuka: Are you sure?\r\nMaki: Yeah, leave it to me.\r\nSuzuka: ......\r\nSuzuka/Maki: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nAradama: GYOOOOoooo...\r\nMaki: How's that?\r\nSuzuka: We've still only brought down two of them. We'll keep going at this pace!\r\nMaki: Of course!\r\nSuzuka: (Honestly...

Writing up a report after every single mission is getting to be a real chore.\r\nSuzuka: Be thankful we have a computer database now. The way things were organized several years ago was much worse.\r\nMaki: Worse than this, huh... Just imagining it gives me chills.\r\nYume: Can I help?\r\nMaki: You can help by not helping. You're just going to end up giving us more work here.\r\nYume: Hey, Maki onee-san! That was mean!\r\nMaki: But it's the truth. There's no other way I can break it to you. Besides, you're just looking to use this as an excuse to stay up late, aren't you? Go to bed, Yume.\r\nYume: First you treat me like I'm a nuisance, and now you treat me like a kid! You really are mean!\r\nYomi: We should take a break here, everyone. I made you all some black tea.\r\nSuzuka: Ara, thank you very much, Yomi-san.\r\nMaki: Sure, we could use some rest.\r\nYume: You're so thoughtful, Yomi onee-san! I'll have some! ...Ughgh!\r\nYume: Th-This stuff... Smells like that stomach medicine I had to take... Is this poisoned...?\r\nSuzuka: ...I-It has a somewhat distinct, unique flavor for black tea, doesn't it?\r\nYomi: Yes, it's known as lapsang souchong. The leaves are smoke dried over pinewood fires, adding a rich aroma to it.\r\nYomi: Nearly all production of lapsang souchong happens in Great Britain, making it very rare to find in Japan. I was lucky to obtain this today.\r\nYomi: Black tea itself is said to have been first invented when military forces were transporting Chinese tea leaves, which fermented and became black tea. Though, of course, there are many theories as to its origin.\r\nYomi: When making this kind of tea, you must always use hard water. On top of that, if you don't manage the temperature of the water carefully, the aroma will be lost.\r\nMaki: ......\r\nSuzuka: .........\r\nYume: ............\r\nYomi: ......? Is something wrong?\r\nMaki: No, it's just, I've never heard you talk that much before...\r\nYomi: I was only answering her question. I do like black tea.\r\nSuzuka: Is that so? Yomi-san, I'd be happy if you could speak this freely more often, at least between the four of us.\r\nYomi: Eh... Y-Yes. I... I'll keep that in mind.\r\nMaki: And thanks for making us tea, Yomi. It was a good change of pace.\r\nYomi: I see. I'm glad you liked the lapsang souchong.\r\nYume: Nobody said they liked the tea though...\r\nMaki: What's wrong, Yume? You hardly drank yours.\r\nYume: ...Eh? Ahh, I was just thinking, the caffeine will make it harder to sleep... Right! S-So I'm going to bed!\r\nMaki: Nice work, Yomi. You put Yume to bed in a flash. Ahaha.\r\nYomi: R-Right...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Ahh, So 'Mbarrisin\r\n\r\nMaki: There's been a mass outbreak of aradama in the area... Thanks to that, we received an emergency dispatch.\r\nYume: Well I've been waiting for something like this!\r\nSuzuka: Then let's get to work, everyone.\r\nYomi: Yes, I'll follow your lead.\r\n\r\nMaki: Sigh... Do we really have to write reports immediately after a night mission...?\r\nSuzuka: Even as you say that, you're still faithfully compiling them. I like that about you, Maki-san.\r\nMaki: Nn... I bet what you really like is seeing me suffer through this, isn't it.\r\nSuzuka: Ara, don't be rude. All the help I've given you here should prove otherwise.\r\n*Yume starts poking around*\r\nMaki: Oi, Yume. If you have nothing better to do, then go to bed.\r\nYume: Now you're being mean~! I was just waiting to see if you needed help with anything!\r\nMaki: Or because you're too excited after fighting and now you can't sleep. That's the problem with ki-...\r\nYume: Ah~! And now you're treating me like a kid again! Right!? Suzuka onee-san! Maki onee-san was about to say kids, wasn't she!\r\nYomi: Excuse me...\r\nSuzuka: A-Ara, Yomi! Did you bring us tea?\r\nYomi: Yes. To clear your tension after sortieing, I prepared a chamomile blend tonight.\r\nYume: ...Nnnn? Yomi onee-san, something smells kinda like its burnt. Did you shower after we came back?\r\nYomi: That's... Um, these...\r\nYume: You baked cookies too? Hooray! You gotta have cookies with tea, after all! ......Wait, these are burnt black...\r\nYomi: My apologies; I haven't gotten used to cooking yet. Ahh, so 'mbarrisin.\r\nMaki: Huh?\r\nSuzuka: What was that, Yomi?\r\nYume: 'Mbarrisin?\r\nYomi: Ah... Sorry you had to hear that. That's how we say we're embarrassed in the Akita dialect.\r\nYume: Kyahahaha! 'Mbarrisin! That's so weird-!\r\nMaki: Yume!\r\nSuzuka: Don't be disrespectful to the way others speak.\r\nMaki: Yomi, don't worry about it now. ...But when we're on a mission, I need you to be more careful with your words.\r\nMaki: If we can't quickly and clearly understand you, in the worst case scenario, someone could lose their life. You wouldn't want that either, right?\r\nYomi: Right. I'll bear that in mind from now on.\r\nSuzuka: ...Yomi. Moreover, these cookies. They didn't actually turn out that badly.\r\nYomi: (Today is the first time someone hasn't laughed at my dialect. Ahh, so 'mbarrisin. Bu's real joyus too...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Fear the Namahage\r\n\r\nYume: Nihihihi... I found it~! I found it~! I know what Yomi onee-san's scared of~!\r\nYume: Yomi onee-san's from Akita, so she should be scared of the \"Namahage\".\r\nYume: Apparently a lot of people from Akita have some kind of childhood trauma about it.\r\nYume: But she's older now, so is it still gonna scare her? I'll just have to do a little test.\r\nYume: I'll hide here where Yomi onee-san should be passing by...\r\n*Yomi comes by and Yume jumps out*\r\nYume: \"ANY CRYBABIES 'ROUND HERE-!!\"\r\nYomi: -!! ............\r\nYume: ...Gotcha~! Yomi onee-san, were you scared? You were scared, weren't you?\r\nYomi: ............\r\nYume: Uhh, huh? Yomi onee-san? Yomi oneeee-san?\r\nYume: ...Eh, you're kidding. She's out cold?\r\nMaki: What's wrong, Yume? What are you and Yomi up to?\r\nYume: Eh, uh, nothing. Well, umm...\r\nYume: I just heard somewhere that Yomi onee-san was scared of the Namahage, so uh, I was just wondering how scared she'd be, and...\r\nMaki: Yomi's unconscious!? Oi, Yomi! Yomi! Wake up! Pull yourself together! Yume! What did you do!?\r\nMaki: DAMNIT, YUME!! YOU'VE REALLY DONE IT THIS TIME!!\r\nYume: Shorry!\r\nYomi: Hya!! N-Namahage!! The Namahage's scolding Tsubakuro-san...!\r\nYomi: U-Unn... ............\r\nYume: Ah... She passed out again. So you're the real Namahage here, Maki onee-san.\r\nMaki: I-I wasn't that bad... Yomi! Yomi! I don't look that scary, do I...!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: I Do Love Rice, After All\r\n\r\nYomi: (munch munch... munch munch much...)\r\nYume: Oh? What're you eating, Yomi onee-san?\r\nYomi: Omusubi.\u3000(munch munch...)\r\nYume: Onigiri? [both are rice balls]\r\nYomi: This isn't onigiri. It's omusubi. (munch munch...)\r\nYume: Same difference. You're pretty picky.\r\nYomi: Would you like one too, Tsubakuro-san? (munch munch...)\r\nYume: I'm not really that hungry, but what else is in that onigiri?\r\nYomi: Only salt. (munch munch...)\r\nYume: Huhh? Who eats onigiri with just salt, not even a seaweed wrap?\r\nYomi: I do. (munch munch...) When you wrap it in seaweed or add other ingredients, it becomes harder to appreciate the flavor of the rice.\r\nYomi: Omusubi is simply rice and salt. That's the best.  (munch munch...)\r\nYume: Huh... Well I guess you don't need anything else if the rice tastes good enough.\r\nYomi: Yes. (munch munch...) With delicious enough rice, rice alone is enough of a meal.\r\nYomi: And rice itself is the greatest energy food. As you chew it, the starch is broken down and absorbed as sugars, which are very good for you.\r\nYomi: Particularly brown rice, which is unparalleled as the world's perfect food. Eating white rice blended with brown rice will provide you in abundance all the nutrition needed to maintain a healthy body.\r\nYomi: By the way, Tsubakuro-san. You called these onigiri, but in fact the ones formed in a triangular shape are actually omusubi. That shape is meant to mimic that of a mountain.\r\nYomi: Water is vital to making rice. Supposedly, it's intended to show respect to the mountains from which rivers flow. (munch munch munch...)\r\nYume: O-Okay...\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, would you like some omusubi as well? I'll share half of them with you. They're made from the delicious rice of Akita, where I was born.\r\nYume: Eh... I-I'm good for now. I'm not that hungry. Ahaha, I'll see you later-!\r\nYume: (I think she had something like 20 of them there!? Who could eat even 10 onigiri with just salt-!? No way! I couldn't even eat 10 onigiri period!)\r\n*Yume runs off*\r\nYomi: But they're so delicious. (munch munch munch...)\r\nYomi: Though, I did make too many. I'll eat one more. The rest can be saved for a snack, dinner, a late night snack, tomorrow's breakfast, and then lunch. (munch munch...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Feelings in Passing\r\n\r\nYomi: .........\r\nSayaka: .........\r\nYomi: .........\r\nSayaka: ...Satsuki Yomi, didn't you call me here...?\r\nYomi: .........\r\nSayaka: ...If you don't need anything, then I'll leave.\r\nYomi: It's about... President Takatsu.\r\nSayaka: The president...?\r\nYomi: For a long time, for President Takatsu, I...\r\nYomi: I believed I only existed for President Takatsu's sake.\r\nYomi: Even though I was incompetent as a toji, even though I had no use, she gave me both power and hope.\r\nYomi: But, after joining the elite guard, my duty to them and to protect Yukari-sama meant I could no longer be at her side.\r\nYomi: For President Takatsu's sake, I would do anything without regrets, and yet...\r\nYomi: Ultimately, I couldn't reach her ideals... What she truly desired was you.\r\nYomi: That's why...\r\nYomi: Please look after her. You are the only one who can stay with her now.\r\nYomi: Separated from her like this, I need you to help President Takatsu in my place, Itsuki-san.\r\nSayaka: ...You don't have to ask me. That's my mission.\r\nSayaka: If that's all, then goodbye, Satsuki Yomi...

That means we've got a thief to catch, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYomi: Yes, and the culprit is an aradama.\r\nYume: Sounds like it! So let's start searching! We'll do an undercover search!\r\nYomi: ...An undercover search?\r\nYume: Yeah! I'll wear a wedding dress and lure it out, so you just have to watch me, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYomi: ...Is there a dress available for us to use?\r\nChapel Staff: Ah, yes, of course. I'll have one for you right away.\r\nYume: A wedding dress~! I can't wait~!\r\nYomi: So this is the reason you proposed an undercover search.\r\nYomi: Very well. Then, please leave the aradama to me.\r\nYume: Why!?\r\nYomi: It's possible the aradama may not appear if you are holding an okatana.\r\nYomi: The decoy should focus entirely on luring out the aradama. The guard will take care of the rest.\r\nYume: I don't want to wear a wedding dress then! You wear it, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYomi: Weren't you looking forward to wearing it?\r\nYume: I was, but... If I don't fight, then I can't show off my good side.\r\nYomi: ...Understood.\r\nYomi: We will switch off acting as the decoy, so I will have a wedding dress prepared for me as well.\r\nYume: Hey hey? Is it okay if I take a picture of you wearing your dress, Yomi-onee-san?\r\nYomi: ...What would you need that for?\r\nYume: To remember the occasion! We might not get to do this again, so I want to show everyone!\r\nYomi: ...Eh? Everyone...?\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san and Yukari-sama!\r\nYomi: Th-That would be...\r\nYume: No backing out-! We're doing it for sure-! Ahaha, I can't wait-!\r\nYomi: For... sure?\r\nYume: Yeah!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Bride Yomi: End]: Please Don't Look\r\n\r\nYume: Is she ready yet-, is Yomi-onee-san ready yet-?\r\nYomi: ...Sorry for taking so long.\r\nYume: Ah, I've been waiting forever, Yomi-on--\r\nYume: ...Wow! You look super pretty, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYomi: D-Do you think so? It doesn't feel right on me...\r\nYume: No way! You're like a real bride!\r\nYomi: ...Th-Thank you very much. Hopefully the aradama thinks I am a real bride too...\r\nYume: What do you want to do until the aradama shows up? Should we walk around?\r\nYomi: First, we should wait here.\r\nYomi: If it doesn't come... Then we can walk around a little.\r\nYume: Hey hey, while we wait for the aradama, I can take some pictures, right?\r\nYomi: ...Please don't point your phone at me.\r\nYume: There's no way I'm passing up something this fun. Give me a smile!\r\nYomi: ...\r\nYume: C'mon-! You have to smile!\r\nYomi: I thought I was smiling...\r\nYume: You're not smiling at all. Like, say cheese!\r\nYomi: Ch-Cheese?\r\nYume: Hmm, you still aren't smiling right.\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOO!!\r\nYomi: Ah!? Tsubakuro-san! The aradama!\r\nYume: Oh, you're right. HAAAA!!\r\nYume: Huh, that was nothing.\r\nYomi: ...Tsubakuro-san, you weren't supposed to defeat it. Now we can't identify where the stolen ring was taken.\r\nYume: The heck, that sounds annoying.\r\nYomi: We have no choice but to wait for another aradama to appear.\r\n\r\nYukari: You did well on your assignment. ...Yomi?\r\nYomi: Yes?\r\nYukari: That wedding dress suited you.\r\nYomi: H-How did you... Tsubakuro-san!?\r\nYume: Ah, yep. I showed it around to everyone.\r\nYomi: B-By everyone, you mean...\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san, and Suzuka-onee-san~.\r\nYomi: I should have firmly refused...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNBCw7znJRI\r\n\r\n[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start]: Yomi's Weak Point\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Are you ready to start?\r\nYomi: I am ready at any time...

You've been working hard, Satsuki-san. Let's take a quick break.\r\nYomi: ...I do not need a break.\r\nTsugumi: Hmmm, considering the margins for safety, I'd prefer if you were rested though.\r\nTsugumi: The next aradama to appear will be more powerful, so it could be difficult if you aren't in peak condition.\r\nYomi: ...There won't be any problems.\r\nTsugumi: ...Understood. If that's what you believe, we'll continue.\r\nTsugumi: Though, if you ever feel in danger, just say so, okay?\r\nYomi: Right.\r\nTsugumi: In that case, I'll send out the next one.\r\nBull Type Aradama: ......\r\nYomi: ...!? A bull type...\r\nBull Type Aradama: ROAAAAAAAAR!\r\nYomi: Hya...\r\nTsugumi: Satsuki-san?\r\nYomi: Ah......\r\nTsugumi: Satsuki-san!? What's wrong, Satsuki-san!!\r\nBull Type Aradama: GAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nYomi: AAAAUGH!!\r\n\r\nYomi: ...Where am I? I remember, I was in the laboratory...\r\nYume: Ah, you're awake, Yomi-onee-san.\r\nYomi: Yes... Good morning, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Now's not the time to be saying, \"Good morning\"!\r\nYume: I was getting worried that you weren't going to wake up, you know?\r\nYomi: You're right... It seems I wasn't thinking straight.\r\nYomi: I thought I was at Ban-san's lab, but now...\r\nYume: I was worried, so I had them bring you here. I'm not supposed to leave here since I'm on duty.\r\nYomi: ...Is that so. Thank you, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: You don't have to thank me.\r\nYume: Anyway, were the aradama at that researcher onee-san's place that strong? I thought she didn't have anything but weaklings.\r\nYomi: That's right. It was an ordinary aradama.\r\nYume: Why'd you get hurt then?\r\nYomi: That's because... It's somewhat of a long story. Do you want to hear it?\r\nYume: Yeah! Tell me all about it!\r\nYomi: It happened when I was in elementary school... I was involved in an aradama incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End]: To One Day Repay Her\r\n\r\nYomi: It happened when I was in elementary school... I was involved in an aradama incident.\r\nYume: Was it something like... The aradama back then was the same kind as the one at the lab?\r\nYomi: ...How did you know that?\r\nYume: Anybody could figure that out. There's nothing else it could be.\r\nYomi: ...I see. In that case, there's no need for me to explain the rest.\r\nYume: Ehh, I wanna hear more about what you were like when you were younger, Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYume: What were you like back then?\r\nYomi: What was I like...? A normal elementary school student. I was a normal girl.\r\nYume: There's gotta be something more, right?\r\nYomi: ...There was nothing special about me. I was normal.\r\nYomi: Anyway, the incident involved a bull type aradama appearing on the main road... Several vehicles had been totaled.\r\nYomi: I was also nearly crushed by it.\r\nYume: That's like something out of a monster movie.\r\nYomi: Yes, I felt that I would die there. However... Moments later, a platoon of toji from Renpu arrived, and I was safely rescued.\r\nYume: Right in the nick of time! Do you know any of the girls who saved you?\r\nYomi: ...I only learned this later on, but the one directing that platoon was President Takatsu.\r\nYume: Really!?\r\nYomi: Yes. I want to repay her for that someday.\r\nYume: Repay her? Like how? By beating more aradama?\r\nYomi: ...Something like that.\r\nYomi: Since that incident, I had never faced another bull type aradama... But it seems my body still remembers the fear it felt then.\r\nYume: Hmmm. In that case, you should chop up that bull aradama.\r\nYomi: ...What?\r\nYume: You're only scared cause it beat you! So, won't you be fine after you kill one?\r\nYomi: ...Will I?\r\nYomi: No... You're right, if possible, I would like to overcome it one day...\r\nYume: Since you agree with me, let's go to the lab!\r\nYomi: ...Eh?\r\n\r\nYume: Onee-san, get a bull type aradama ready for us-!\r\nTsugumi: Tsubakuro-san, and... I see you're up and about again, Satsuki-san.\r\nYomi: I'm sorry to have made you worry.\r\nTsugumi: No no, it wasn't your fault.\r\nTsugumi: Anyway, a bull type aradama? I can have it ready in a moment, so are you ready to fight, Tsubakuro-san?\r\nYume: What do you mean? I'm not the one fighting it; Yomi-onee-san is.\r\nTsugumi: Satsuki-san... Will fight it?\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, if I see that aradama again, it's likely my body will freeze up once more.\r\nYume: I know that; the whole reason we're here is to help you beat that.\r\nYume: Don't worry about anything. If it looks like you're in trouble, I'll chop up that aradama for you.\r\nYume: Then you'll get used to it after a while, right?\r\nTsugumi: Well, in that case... I suppose there would be no danger.\r\nYomi: (I think my mental state will be in danger however...)\r\nYomi: ...I understand.\r\nYomi: It would cause problems if I were unable to act in the field, so please help me, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: You got it!\r\nYomi: Then... Ban-san, please begin. I'm going to accustom myself to fighting the bull type aradama.\r\n\r\nBull Type Aradama: ROAAAAAAAR!\r\nYomi: ...!\r\nYume: Way to go, Yomi-onee-san! You dodged its attack!\r\nYomi: ...It seems I'm growing used to my fear.\r\nYume: Think you can beat it?\r\nYomi: I'll try, but...!?\r\nBull Type Aradama: GUUUOOOOO!!\r\nYomi: (...I'm scared. My body won't stop shaking... This fear won't be erased so easily after all...)\r\nYomi: (Though... I did manage to stop its attack.)\r\nBull Type Aradama: OOUUUUUUU!!\r\nYume: Yomi-onee-san!?\r\nYomi: (If I lose focus, I could be crushed... However, as I am now, I can stop these attacks...)\r\nYomi: [Inhale... Exhale...]\r\nYomi: ...HAA!\r\nBull Type Aradama: GYAAAAAOOOOOO!!\r\nYume: You did it-!

When I saw it, I thought, President Souraku knows her stuff! My yukata's so cute!\r\nMaki: Yume.\r\nYume: Eh... Wah!?\r\nMaki: The crowd's thick. If you don't look where you're going, you'll bump into someone.\r\nYume: Actually, what's with this huge line!?\r\nSuzuka: Business is booming. What could it be for?\r\nStall Managing Toji: Ah, the elite guard, with Yukari-sama...! This line is for our yakisoba.\r\nYukari: ...!\r\nStall Managing Toji: Yakisoba seemed popular at festivals in the past, so we tried copying that, but this was more than I imagined...\r\nYukari: I see.\r\nYukari: ......\r\nYomi: Yukari-sama... If you'd like some, I could stand in line for you?\r\nStall Managing Toji: Yukari-sama herself... Wants to try our yakisoba!?\r\nStall Managing Toji: I-I'll bring you some straight away...!\r\nYukari: ...No, stop. The two of you needn't concern yourselves with me.\r\nYukari: With all these people in line, I shouldn't be the only one to receive special treatment.\r\nYukari: Yomi, you have your duty to patrol and observe the area. As for the yakisoba... That's right. If any is left over, I will have some then.\r\nYomi: As you wish.\r\nYukari: Don't let it bother you. Now then, we'll look around elsewhere. We have to ensure no one is hurt or in trouble.\r\nStall Managing Toji: ...Y-Yes ma'am!\r\nYume: Is Yukari-sama okay with that-? With how long that line is, won't they run out quick for sure?\r\nYomi: If Yukari-sama insists, we shouldn't object any further.\r\nYume: Ehh, but she looked like she wanted to have some-.\r\nMaki: We're going, you two. We can't allow Yukari-sama to go on ahead by herself.\r\nYomi: We can't afford to get lost either. Will you take my hand, Tsubakuro-san?\r\nYume: Guess I don't have a choice, huh~. We'd be in a lot of trouble if you got lost, Yomi-onee-san.\r\nYomi: Yes, I'll feel better this way. Let's go join them.\r\nYume: Okay!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Yukata Yomi: End]: Someday, in Memory\r\n\r\nYume: Ah, there's this thing with all these little balls floating in the water! Hey hey, what is this?\r\nSuzuka: I'm not quite sure what all these balls are for...\r\nYomi: They're for super ball scooping.\r\nYume/Suzuka: ...Super ball?\r\nYume: Why are they super?\r\nYomi: Their repulsive force is super. If you throw them against the wall or floor, they bounce off with great force. And also, the rugby ball shaped ones bounce unpredictably.\r\nYume: They sound fun! I want some! I can try scooping them, can't I?\r\nMaki: Fine by me; go ahead.\r\nYume: I'll get a whole lot, so I'll give you some too, Suzuka-onee-san!\r\nSuzuka: Good. I'll look forward to it.\r\nYomi: Allow me to offer some advice before you attempt it. It's a common misconception, but it's actually harder for the scoop to be broken if you let it fully soak in the water.\r\nYume: Wait, really!?\r\nYomi: If only a part of it is wet, it will break more easily. Also, I suggest not aiming for larger ones and many at once.\r\nYume: Thanks for the tips, Yomi-onee-san.\r\n\r\nYomi: You did it, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Wasn't it way easier than the goldfish though, cause they aren't moving around on their own-?\r\nYume: Wait, where's Suzuka-onee-san and Maki-onee-san?\r\nYomi: Over there, eating shaved ice.\r\n\r\nMaki: You can't go to a summer festival without trying this.\r\nSuzuka: Strawberry, melon, lemon, blue hawaii... They had so many choices that I couldn't make my mind up.\r\nMaki: You went with blue hawaii, didn't you?\r\nSuzuka: I couldn't imagine how it would taste. I only chose it on your recommendation. It's sweet and rather good.\r\nMaki: The only downside is it turns your tongue blue.\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, and what's wrong with that? I find that sort of thing funny.\r\nMaki: I had a feeling you'd say something like that.\r\nSuzuka: Hey...!\r\n\r\nYume: Ah! Lucky-. We should get some shaved ice too!\r\nYomi: I agree. What flavor would you like, Tsubakuro-san?\r\nYume: Strawberry!\r\nYomi: Understood. I'll go buy it, so please wait here for a moment.\r\nYume: I'll just go with you!\r\nYomi: That reminds me, earlier, I saw an Ichigo Daifuku Neko mask in one of the stalls.\r\nYume: Wait, you did!?\r\nYomi: Should we go buy that first?\r\nYume: ...Isn't wearing masks sort of for kids-? I do like Ichigo Daifuku Neko though.\r\nYomi: Do you think so? I think it would be cute if you wore it, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: W-Well... If you say so, Yomi-onee-san, then maybe we can go look around for it a little, after we get shaved ice.\r\nYomi: I think that's a good idea.\r\nYume: Festivals sure are fun, huh.\r\nYomi: Yes, very much so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/ZYwru7GiMV0\r\n[Valkyrie - Yomi: Start]: A Sudden Call from Akira\r\n\r\nAkira: Oiii, Yomi! Here, over here~.\r\nYomi: I could tell where you were without you having to shout.\r\nAkira: You just looked like you were kinda spacing out over there. Anyway, ready to go?\r\n\r\nYomi: I was wondering where you were taking me. A cakery?\r\nAkira: What's wrong with that? The limited run parfaits this place makes get a lot of talk for being good.\r\nYomi: You still like parfaits like you used to.\r\nYomi: So, what was the reason you called me here for?\r\nAkira: I had a little something to take care of around here. So I thought I'd give you a call. It's no fun eating by yourself, right?\r\nYomi: ......\r\nAkira: I know you've probably got a lot going on too, but you've gotta take a breather every now and then.\r\nYomi: I have to be part of a promotional photo shoot later today, so I can't stay here for very long.\r\nAkira: Huhh? What're you doing a photo shoot for?\r\nYomi: You could say it has to do with the results of the Miss Five Traditions competition that was held the other day, I suppose.\r\nAkira: Ahh, oh yeah, they put those out, huh.\r\nAkira: That reminds me, didn't you place pretty high yourself? I was surprised to hear it. I never thought you'd be up there.\r\nAkira: Though, it must be boring as hell to sit through some photo shoot cause of it.\r\nYomi: I can't neglect this, considering it's part of my duties as a toji.\r\nAkira: You got so straight laced. But, if that's what you're set on. You better do it right.\r\nAkira: You gonna be doing it in your uniform? They'd probably get mad if you wore something too casual; so a jacket like mine's out.\r\nYomi: You're probably right. Though, this time it's arranged for me to wear a valkyrie themed costume, along with Tsubakuro-san and the others.\r\nAkira: ......\r\nAkira: What're you talking about?\r\nYomi: You may not know about it, Akira, but valkyries were something that was part of Norse mythology--\r\nAkira: It's not like I don't know what valkyries are...! I'm asking, why're they making you dress up like that...!?\r\nYomi: That's what I'd like to know.\r\nAkira: Yeah, I guess... The bureau does say to do some ridiculous stuff sometimes, huh.\r\nAkira: ...Well, do what you can. Whatever you're buying here'll be my treat.\r\nYomi: Then, I'll have some tea. The black tea here is fairly good; it goes well with sweet foods.\r\nAkira: I'll have the same thing you're drinking then.\r\nAkira: Ah, when you get the photos back, lemme see. Those'll be fun to look through for sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Valkyrie - Yomi: End]: This One is My Favorite\r\n\r\nAkira: Yo! It's rare for you to call me to hang out.\r\nYomi: I got the photos back from that photo shoot we spoke about the other day.\r\nYomi: I think they'll be published online soon, but I had heard you were coming by on an assignment.\r\nAkira: Cool; let me just put my bike away. Wait here a minute.\r\n\r\nAkira: So, how'd that photo shoot turn out anyway?\r\nYomi: Like this.\r\nAkira: Whoa-!? The hell... You're looking way too cool in this.\r\nAkira: That sharp look on your face is great. It came out really damn nice.\r\nYomi: I didn't expect you to praise it so much.\r\nAkira: Why not? Of course I would if it turned out this good.\r\nYomi: That's true. Though, I expected you to make fun of me.\r\nAkira: Yeah, if I'm being honest, I was planning to, until I actually saw this. This whole valkyrie thing came out of nowhere.\r\nAkira: But this seems like it'll get some attention. Especially if Tsubakuro Yume and Kanami and the others are doing it.\r\nAkira: You got any other shots of you in this?\r\nYomi: No. This is the only one I brought with me.\r\nAkira: That's too bad. I really like the look of this one.\r\nYomi: I see. I wasn't sure which photo to bring myself, so the others in the special defense team picked it out for me.\r\nAkira: Huh. Didn't think you were so close with them, Yomi.\r\nAkira: Does that mean you're pushing omusubi on them too?\r\nYomi: Sometimes... I do.\r\nAkira: The omusubi you make are weirdly good, y'know. Somehow, just talking about them made me hungry.\r\nAkira: I'm thinking of getting something to eat here, but, what about you?\r\nYomi: I'd like to join you, but I've already made plans.\r\nAkira: With the special defense team?\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nAkira: Guess there's no helping that. We didn't get to see each other much, but I had fun today.\r\nYomi: I did too. Then, until next time.\r\nAkira: She's working real hard for her buddies, huh.\r\nAkira: Alright... I've gotta stick to it too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/AD0Bdd24GGM\r\n[Xmas' 19 - Yomi: Start]: An Unpredictable Present\r\n\r\nYomi: A Christmas Eve party...?\r\nSuzuka: Yes, all toji from the Five Traditions are gathering for a big occasion, and of course, we of the elite guard have been invited as well.\r\nYomi: I see. I have some business I want to take care of before the end of the year, so please go without me.\r\nMaki: Well, we can't do that. Since it's a big party, we got permission from Yukari-sama, saying we should all go.\r\nSuzuka: And Yume seems to be trying her best at getting something ready. It would be terrible if you weren't there.\r\nYomi: Is that right... Then, I suppose I'll have to go. Is there anything I need to prepare in advance?\r\nMaki: It said on the invitation they're doing a gift exchange at the end of the party, so everybody needs to have one gift ready.\r\nSuzuka: With all the people that should be there, an exchange should be exciting. I should get mine ready straight away~.\r\nMaki: Wait up, Suzuka! I want your advice on what to go with. I'm coming with you!\r\nYomi: The two of them left. Sigh... A gift exchange...\r\nYomi: A gift which you can't anticipate who will be receiving it... That's a fairly difficult request.\r\nYomi: A present that would make anyone happy... Something that, no matter how many people got it, they would be happy with... Like, for example, delicious white rice...\r\nYomi: Ah-! That's what I could do.\r\nYomi: I've reached a stopping point in my duties, so I'll quickly go out to do some shopping.\r\n\r\nYomi: I may have bought a bit too much, but I suppose I'll get right to cooking. It's a good thing the kitchen was available.\r\nEllen: Wow! Yomiyomi! I don't often run into you in a place like this~!\r\nKiyoka: Are we maybe getting in your way?\r\nYomi: No, it's fine so long as I can use the faucet and stove. You can use the next counter over if it's fine with you.\r\nKiyoka: Thanks for that then! Though, you sure have a lot of rice. And a nice big pot.\r\nEllen: Are you getting ready for the Christmas party or something?\r\nYomi: Yes, they said we would need something for the gift exchange, so I was thinking of using a type of rice that tastes delicious when cold to make omusubi.\r\nEllen: Wow! Now that's a coincidence~! Kiyoka and I were here to make sweets for the present exchange too.\r\nKiyoka: I'm baking cookies, and Ellen-san was going to make muffins.\r\nYomi: I see, sweets are a standard gift for schoolgirls. You do often see them decorated for Christmas on sale around town.\r\nYomi: To give omusubi as a Christmas present... Maybe what I'm making will be out of place.\r\nKiyoka: That's not true at all! Even with onigiri, depending on how you decorate them, they can definitely be cute Christmas presents!\r\nEllen: That's right~! Christmas style onigiri! If I got something like that, I'd be extra happy!\r\nKiyoka: Um, if it's alright, could we help you make them? We'll make a Christmas style onigiri bento!\r\nEllen: Definitely~! I'll help with Yomiyomi's onigiri bento too!\r\nYomi: Musumi-san, Kohagura-san, thank you both. I appreciate you wanting to help. However, what I want to make is not onigiri bento.\r\nKiyoka/Ellen: Eh?\r\nYomi: It's omusubi bento.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Xmas' 19 - Yomi: End]: The Fun of Giving\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Still though, Christmas style onigi... Ah-! Omusubi! How do you think those should look?\r\nEllen: For cakes, something called a Buche de Noel is popular. It's a roll cake decorated to look like a log of wood.\r\nYomi: I see, a log of wood... If it were a sushi roll, I could make it look that way.\r\nKiyoka: It wouldn't be very Christmas-like though, would it.\r\nYomi: Since it's difficult expressing Christmas through the shape...\r\nKiyoka: I know! For Christmas onigi... Ah-! Omusubi! What about this? You could bring out the feeling with red and green ingredients.\r\nYomi: Red and green... In that case, I have umeboshi and shiyazuke for red, and shiso leaves for green.\r\nEllen: Both of those would go perfect with onigi... Rice balls!\r\nKiyoka: That was a nice save, Ellen-san.\r\nYomi: Thank you both. With your suggestions, I should be able to make these omusubi feel like Christmas.\r\nKiyoka: I'm glad we could help. Then, Ellen-san, we should get to making our own sweets now.\r\nEllen: You're right. Though, Kiyoka, you sure have a lot of shapes for cutting cookies.\r\nEllen: There's Santa Claus, reindeers, stars. They all feel like Christmas!\r\nKiyoka: They're all so cute, so I couldn't help but bring them out... Ah, I know! Satsuki-san, I came up with something good!\r\nYomi: Something good?\r\nKiyoka: If you use my cookie cutters, and cut out a bit of omelette...\r\nEllen: Wow! That's a pretty Christmas star! If you put that with Yomiyomi's rice balls...!\r\nYomi: It looks beautiful... Like a Christmas tree inside the bento box.\r\nKiyoka: It really is! It turned out cuter than I thought!\r\nEllen: Whoever gets this lunch box during the gift exchance will be very happy!\r\nKiyoka: Yeah! I'm sure they'll be happy with it! I'm looking forward to tomorrow.\r\nYomi: Thank you very much. Now I won't feel uncomfortable joining the party. Then, I'll be leaving now.\r\nKiyoka: Please wait a minute! Since we're exchanging gifts, it'd be a waste to leave it at that!\r\nEllen: For the exchange, you can't not wrap it up all cute~.\r\nYomi: You do have a lot of ribbons and wrapping paper.\r\nKiyoka: Maybe it would be cuter with a gap between the inside and outside! What do you think about this ribbon? Ah, or this one might be cute too!\r\nEllen: You always do have an awesome eye for design, Kiyoka~. Which do you like, Yomiyomi?\r\nYomi: I... think both are fine. I'll go with whatever you choose.\r\nKiyoka: Alright then! If we tie this ribbon on, it's ready!\r\nYomi: My omusubi became such a cute present... Musumi-san, Kohagura-san, I can't thank you enough.\r\n\r\nThe day of the Christmas Eve party.\r\n\r\nMirja: Now then, for the final event of the party, all who joined us will be exchanging gifts. Everyone, do you all have your presents ready?\r\nKanami/Mai/Yume: We dooo!\r\nYomi: ......\r\nKiyoka: What's the matter, Satsuki-san? The gift exchange is starting.\r\nYomi: Musumi-san. Everyone seems to have brought such proper gifts, so are omusubi really alright...?\r\nKiyoka: It'll be fine. I know for sure someone will be glad to get it. Aren't you excited to see the happy look on their face when they open it?\r\nYomi: The face they make... I hadn't thought about it, but you're right. I am a little interested.\r\nEllen: Yomiyomi, Kiyoka! They're starting the gift exchange. Let's go over!\r\nYomi: Alright.\r\nYomi: (The happy face of the person who receives it... That's the fun of giving presents, isn't it...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/UDpu_4zvXrw\r\n[Journey to the West - Yomi: Start]: What Is Tsubakuro-san Going to Do?\r\n\r\nYukari: Satsuki. Konohana will be joining me at this evening's conference. I won't be needing an escort. You'll be assisting Shidou instead.\r\nYomi: Understood.\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san. If there's an urgent request for aid, please do all you can.\r\nMaki: Sure, you can count on us.\r\nYukari: We'll be going then.\r\nYume: Huh-? Did Yukari-sama and Suzuka-onee-san go out somewhere?\r\nYomi: They just left for a conference.\r\nYume: Ehh, but I thought I'd get Yukari-sama to play with me. It feels like you onee-sans have been really busy lately.\r\nYomi: Apart from our aradama suppression missions, there's always something to take care of.\r\nYume: But because of that, we haven't gotten to play at all. Or, actually, haven't we barely been able to get the four of us together lately?\r\nMaki: You're right. The rate of aradama appearances isn't dropping at all though. There's too much work needing toji to do it.\r\nYume: If it's aradama, then I can beat as many as I have to!\r\nYomi: It's reassuring to have you, Tsubakuro-san, but you can't respond to aradama appearing in multiple locations at once.\r\nYomi: Looking at the whole picture, even if you are very active, it won't reduce the overall work of toji that much.\r\nYume: Mmgh.\r\nMaki: Though, I get what Yume's saying. But it's hard getting all of us time off at the same time.\r\nYume: Then, it'd be fine if it's not when we have time off?\r\nYomi: ...What do you mean?\r\nYume: You'll find out later~.\r\nYume: There's something I've gotta go do real quick.\r\nYomi: What do you think she's up to?\r\nMaki: No idea... But, it's always a bit scary when Yume gets an idea.\r\n\r\nYume: Hey hey, Onee-san. There's a little something I want you do to for me, okay?\r\nTsugumi: If it's something I can manage, then I don't mind.\r\nYume: Y'see--\r\n\r\nA few days later.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: I recieved a message from Yume earlier, but do you know what this is about, Yomi-san?\r\nYomi: No. I only know that, several days ago, she seemed to be planning something.\r\nSuzuka: Well, we're lucky to be spending some time together, though it's only for a few hours.\r\nYomi: That's true. I'm slightly looking forward to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Journey to the West - Yomi: End]: It Might Be Nice to Continue Our Journey\r\n\r\nMaki: Hey... Yomi. What are we doing here, anyway...\r\nYomi: What are you saying now, Pigsy? I'm Sandy. And we have to defeat these bandits to rescue our master.\r\nMaki: Didn't think you'd get so into this... Uh, Sandy.\r\nYomi: That was a joke.\r\nYomi: I wasn't sure what to expect when Tsubakuro-san invited us for training, but I didn't imagine we would be using the VR facilities.\r\nMaki: I'm still not completely used to this whole VR thing... But it's useful if you think of this as time spent strengthening the SDDT's coordination.\r\nMaki: Though, did it really need to be done up like Journey to the West...?\r\nYomi: This training program seems to be popular. And also, I think Tsubakuro-san is fitting for the role of the Monkey King.\r\nMaki: The Monkey King's wild and uncontrollable side might be a good fit for her. Though, I'm not that on board with me being Pigsy...\r\nYomi: Is it bothering you? I didn't think you'd mind. I've heard that Pigsy is a popular character in China.\r\nMaki: Is he really?\r\nYomi: Yes.\r\nYomi: But, right now, there's something we have to do to break our master out, Pigsy.\r\nMaki: That's what I mean, calling me Pigsy is... Forget it... Let's go, Sandy!\r\nYomi: Please take point. I'll cover our backs.\r\nMaki: On it! We've got to make a diversion so the Monkey King can break out Master Tripitaka!\r\nYomi: Right, let's bring these bandits to justice.\r\n\r\nSuzuka: That was a rather worthwhile training session, wasn't it.\r\nYume: Yeah, it was pretty fun! Though, I was pretty surprised when you started beating bad guys up halfway through, Suzuka-onee-san.\r\nSuzuka: Since this was a training exercise, there was no need for a Tripitaka who did nothing but be protected, was there?\r\nMaki: Our Master Tripitaka's highly capable, after all. Those bandits shouldn't have let their guard down.\r\nSuzuka: I would have liked to have seen you two in action as well though, Pigsy, Sandy.\r\nYomi: In that case, should we continue this journey until the end?\r\nYume: I'm up for that! Let's keep going till we beat the Ox King!\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, Tripitaka's goal isn't to defeat the Ox King. We're traveling to Tianzhu... to India, to retreive the scriptures.\r\nYume: Oh, we are? Then, let's go until we get them!\r\nYume: But wait, let's have Yukari-sama be the Ox King! It'll totally be worth fighting her!\r\nMaki: You know we can't ask Yukari-sama to do something like that.\r\nYume: Ehhh, but you'll never know until we try asking!\r\nMaki: And anyway... Can they really recreate the story all the way to India?\r\nSuzuka: I haven't checked, but wouldn't it be like Ban-san to have gone into that much detail?\r\nYume: Yeah, I'm getting excited for next time~!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/53qQY9kGizE\r\n[Renpu Summer Uniform - Yomi: Start]: Yomi and Akira\r\n\r\nYomi: I thought then that, someday, I wanted to be helpful to that person.\r\n\r\nAkira: ...\r\nYomi: Sorry I made you wait.

We'll be working together from now on. Let's get along.\r\nYume: Onee-san, you won Yukari-sama's tournament twice, right? So you must be really strong. We should fight!\r\nMaki: Right off the bat, huh. Looks like our new recruit's a lively one.\r\nMaki: But unfortunately, I can't right now. There's an aradama suppression mission I need to help with.\r\nYume: Then I'll go with you. We'll have a fight to see who can beat the most aradama!\r\nMaki: You mean a competition to see who has the highest aradama killcount?\r\nMaki: Sounds interesting enough, but without orders to let you come, I can't let you join my unit.\r\nYume: Ehh-!? Just for a little while! If you won't let me, I'm gonna follow you anyway, okay!\r\nMaki: Geez, a real lively kid after all... Well, since you're strong enough to make it into the elite guard, you should be able to handle yourself out there.\r\nYume: Yeah, yeah! I'll be super useful, actually! So let's compete! C'mon, compete with me!\r\nMaki: ...Alright. It seems like a good chance to see what the new recruit's capable of. Okay, I'll accept your challenge!\r\nYume: Hooray-! After I beat you, Maki onee-san, I'll be the first seat!\r\n\r\nYume: There-! That's the last aradama down-!\r\nMaki: You were incredible, Yume. You must have taken out half the aradama on this mission by yourself.\r\nYume: Ehehe! So that means I won, right?\r\nMaki: Yep. I didn't get anywhere near as many as you.\r\nYume: Hooray-! I beat Maki onee-san-!\r\nMaki: I'm surprised by just how strong you are at your age. With you around, the elite guard has a bright future.\r\nYume: So since I beat you, Maki onee-san, that makes me the first seat now, doesn't it!\r\nMaki: Well no, the seats just show the order everyone joined in. So no matter how strong you are, you're the fourth seat, Yume.\r\nYume: Huhh!? Really!? I tried so hard, but it's like I still lost-! You should have made it clearer from the start! Sheesh-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Shopping with Yume\r\n\r\nYume: Yaaay! We all managed to go shopping together in Harajuku today-!\r\nYomi: You were very insistent. But I still don't understand why you wanted me to come...\r\nYume: Because it's more fun with more people!\r\nSuzuka: What a fancy looking shop. Yume, you wanted to buy your Ichigo Daifuku Neko goods here, didn't you?\r\nYume: Yeah! Stickers for my scabbard, and stuffed animals!\r\nMaki: Just be aware of how much money you have to spend.\r\nYume: Okaaay! Let's see, I'll get three of this stuffed animal, so I can have each color...\r\nYume: Oh, but I don't have enough money to get more than one...\r\nMaki: They're just different colors. One should be enough.\r\nYume: Okay... But they're all so cute. I don't know which one to buy...\r\nMaki: ...Well, if you can't make up your mind, I'll have to buy one of them.\r\nYume: Really!? Thank you, Maki onee-san!\r\nSuzuka: You're too soft on her, Maki-san... I suppose that leaves me no choice but to buy another one.\r\nYume: Hooray! That means I can have all of them now! I love you, onee-sans!\r\nSuzuka: A stuffed animal is a small price to pay to see you looking so delighted, Yume.\r\nMaki: Anyway, is there anything else you need? We all came out to Harajuku together, so I'll help you buy whatever you want.\r\nYume: I only wanted stickers and the stuffed animals today, so I don't need to buy anything else!\r\nMaki: O-Okay, if you're fine with that...\r\nSuzuka: --Ah! I know just the thing!\r\nSuzuka: If that's all you wanted here, why don't we stop by that ice cream shop?\r\nSuzuka: It seems they offer waffle cones? I'll pay for yours!\r\nMaki: I like the sound of that. I'll go order a triple scoop.\r\nSuzuka: Hey, Maki-san! Please don't go stealing your way into my idea!\r\nMaki: Well, the one I'll be getting is a triple scoop of chocolate mint, anyway. Ahahaha.\r\nYume: Eww, that stuff tastes like toothpaste though! I don't want any-!\r\nYomi: ...Shidou-san and Konohana-san are like an old couple spoiling their grandchild...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Yume's Unreasonable Request\r\n\r\nYume: Sigh... This is so boring... Yukari-sama's gone, and the other guards won't play with me...\r\nYume: Hey-, hey-, Kazumi onee-san and Wakako onee-san. Tell me a funny story.\r\nWakako: Eh-!? I can't come up with anything when you ask so suddenly...!\r\nKazumi: I'm sorry. Nothing comes to mind.\r\nYume: Ehh~!? You two're so lame~! Hmm, then... Tell me if you two have a crush on anyone!\r\nWakako: Ehh!? W-We don't have to tell you that...\r\nYume: Huh, what's that? The way you reacted says you do have a crush on someone, right, Wakako onee-san?\r\nWakako: Ugh...! ...N-No comment.\r\nYume: Hmm? Fine, be that way. Now it's your turn, Kazumi onee-san!\r\nKazumi: Maki-sama is the one I long for.\r\nWakako: Without any hesitation!?\r\nYume: Eh-! So Kazumi onee-san likes Maki onee-san!\r\nYume: --Now back to you, Wakako onee-san. Who do you like? Is it someone I know?\r\nYume: If you don't say who, I'll use my position as the fourth seat of the elite guard to get you fired~.\r\nWakako: Ughh...!?\r\nWakako: (I'd rather die than say who, but to get fired over such a reason...)\r\nMaki: --Hey, Yume! Stop bothering them!\r\nYume: Ah, Maki onee-san!\r\nMaki: I can't believe you. Whenever you don't have a mission, you just go around annoying people. This causes trouble for me too, you know?\r\nYume: But I'm so bored!\r\nMaki: Really? If you're that bored, then I'll have you cleaning the office daily from now on. I was just looking for someone to take care of that.\r\nYume: Ehh-!? No way! I don't wanna have to clean the office!\r\nMaki: I know a few other places you can clean then. The entrance hall, the hallways, the bathrooms, and then there's...\r\nYume: ...I'm leaving-!!\r\nMaki: She ran away, huh.\r\nWakako: --You scared her off.\r\nKazumi: You're so dependable, Maki-sama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Yume's Adult Appeal\r\n\r\nYume: Aghh-! She told me again that I can't go on a mission because I'm a kid!\r\nYume: This is so boring! Even though I'm the strongest in the elite guard...!\r\nYume: I'll just have to show Yukari-sama I can be as adult as anyone else!\r\nYume: But how do I do that... If I put on makeup, that'd make me look more adult, right?\r\nYume: --I know! I'll just ask the other guards!\r\n\r\nYume: ...So anyway, what do you all think I need to do to be an adult?\r\nYume: Starting with Yomi onee-san, what's your idea!\r\nYomi: ...An adult is someone who pays taxes, aren't they?\r\nSuzuka: That's certainly a very grounded view of it...\r\nMaki: But I can agree with that.\r\nYume: Well that's easy! I'll make sure to pay taxes! Now it's your turn, Suzuka onee-san!\r\nSuzuka: Being an adult is about the way you speak, isn't it?\r\nSuzuka: Yume speaks in a very childish manner. You should at least speak more respectfully around Yukari-sama.\r\nMaki: That's right. I'd be interested in seeing you try it too.\r\nYume: Hm, hmm... Last up, Maki onee-san!\r\nMaki: Normally, you'd think someone's a kid because of their height, right?\r\nSuzuka: But Yume can't exactly go about changing that in a single day.\r\nSuzuka: Though if she wears high heels, it could make a slight difference.\r\nYume: Let's see... So if I put together all your ideas...\r\nYume: I just need to go to Yukari-sama wearing high heels, and ask something like \"Would you please examine this?\" while showing her proof I paid taxes!\r\nSuzuka: You should really just give up on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Yume vs Kanami\r\n\r\nYume: --I finally get to fight you, Onee-san. I've been waiting so long for this.\r\nKanami: You're the one from the elite guard we fought before...! What are you doing here...?\r\nYume: Wanna fight me, Onee-san? I think you're probably stronger than anyone.\r\nYume: So if I beat you, no one will be able to forget how amazing I am!\r\nKanam: ...Mm, okay. I wanted to settle things with you anyway.\r\nYume: Then let's get started right now!\r\nYume: --Hah!!\r\nKanami: So aggressive...! And those pointed strikes...! This is some advanced Ten'nen Rishin-Ryu!\r\nYume: Ahahahaha-! You're having fun, right-!\r\nKanami: Yeah! You're really interesting! Now it's my turn--\r\nKanami: Haaaaaahh-!\r\n\r\nYume: Pant... Pant... ...It's no good. Whatever I do, I can't beat you, Onee-san.\r\nKanami: You're so strong though, Yume-chan! Fighting you was so much fun!\r\nYume: ...Mm. I had a lot of fun fighting you too, Onee-san!\r\nKanami: By the way, those stickers and that strap on your scabbard are super cute! That's Ichigo Daifuku Neko, right?\r\nYume: Yeah! My onee-sans in the elite guard bought them for me!\r\nYume: Do you like Ichigo Daifuku Neko too?\r\nKanami: I love it! I like anything that's cute!\r\nYume: Really! Then you should come shopping with me next time!\r\nKanami: Okay! Sounds like fun! I'll invite Mai-chan and Mihono-chan, and we can all go together!\r\nYume: ...Hey, Onee-san. If we met differently, would we have been friends?\r\nKanami: Of course we would have! And rivals too!\r\nKanami: If we went to school together, I'd challenge you to fights every day! I can't wait to see more of your swordsmanship!\r\nYume: School together... Huh. Fufu... That sounds really fun.\r\nYume: But that's why... It's too bad... It makes it even worse...\r\nKanami: What's so bad about it? It's not too late, you know! We can still be friends!\r\nYume: ...Hey, Onee-san. Don't forget about me, okay...\r\nKanami: ...I won't! I could never forget you!\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3DcgmFmPik\r\nFurisode Part 1: Yume's First Shrine Visit of the Year\r\n\r\nYume: Whoa~, there's so many people. Do we really have to wait in line here?\r\nSuzuka: My, weren't you the one saying you wanted to make your first shrine visit of the year?\r\nYume: I did, but~... I just wanted to go with you onee-sans.\r\nMaki: In that case, do you want to come back later? I get the feeling we'll freeze standing in line with all these people.\r\nYomi: I can go buy something to warm us. Ah, they're handing out sweet sake over there.\r\nMaki: Sweet sake...? That sure would warm us right up.\r\nSuzuka: Since we have the opportunity, we may as well take some. I'll go with you, Yomi-san.\r\nYume: W-Wait, wait, wait! Sweet sake's no good!\r\nSuzuka: Oh, do you not like sweet sake? Perhaps we can find something else for you, Yume.\r\nYume: That's not what I meant! It's not that I don't want it; it's you onee-sans who can't have it!\r\nSuzuka: But I don't dislike sweet sake?\r\nYume: You don't understand... Aghh, the shrine visit!  Let's just do the shrine visit already, before more people show up!\r\n\r\nYume: Sigh~, we're finally done~.\r\nYomi: Was that really enough? You hardly prayed for more than three seconds.\r\nYume: That's all I needed. I didn't want to wish for anything from the gods anyway.\r\nYume: Anyhow, Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san sure are taking their time~.\r\nYomi: About those two, they asked me to tell you they went looking to buy charms.\r\nYume: Charms? ...Hehe, then this works out great. Come with me for a minute, Yomi onee-san! \r\nYume: Now's our chance to get something to eat from the stalls!\r\nYomi: We're buying something from the stalls?\r\nYume: Yup! What should we get~? Do you know what Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san like?  \r\nYomi: I don't. Come to think of it, what do they like to eat?\r\nYume: Yomi-onee-san, I can't count on you for anything~. Oh well, maybe strawberry mochi will work~.\r\nYomi: I don't think anyone is selling strawberry mochi... Why did you want to know what the two of them like to eat?\r\nYume: Hehehe, that's a secret for now~... Oh, I got a great idea! I'll just buy some of everything, and you can help me carry it all, Yomi onee-san.\r\n\r\nMaki: Sorry for the wait... Why do you have all that?\r\nSuzuka: Your arms are full with... Is that food?\r\nYume: Yup. I'm giving all these to you onee-sans, as a gift.\r\nMaki: A gift?\r\nYume: Thank you, onee-sans. If it weren't for you two, we wouldn't be able to do our first shrine visit together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurisode Part 2: Thank You\r\n\r\nYume: Thank you, onee-sans. If it weren't for you two, we wouldn't be able to do our first shrine visit together.\r\nMaki: It's rare hearing you say thanks...\r\nYume: Come on! Just listen to me!\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san, give Yume a chance to talk. \r\nMaki: You're right. Sorry Yume. I didn't mean to make fun of you.\r\nYume: I'm talking about something serious here, okay?\r\nMaki: I know. I'll hear what you have to say. So Yume, what are you thanking us for? \r\nYume: Geez, you're so dense~.\r\nYume: It's because of you onee-sans that I got to do my first shrine visit this year!\r\nYume: That's why, thanks. It's really fun, visiting the shrine with you!\r\nMaki: ...I see, I'm having fun too, Yume.\r\nSuzuka: And I as well.\r\nYume: That's good then~. Here! Have as much as you want!\r\nSuzuka: Since Yume went out of her way to buy all this for us, why don't we find somewhere quiet to enjoy it.\r\nYume: I actually wanted to secretly buy the things you liked, but... I didn't know what to get, so I just bought a whole lot of stuff.\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, that's very like you. Thank you, Yume.\r\nSuzuka: There's nothing I'd like more than whatever you'd buy for me.\r\nYume: Why are you the one thanking me? That's weird, isn't it? I mean, I'm the one who should be thankful.\r\nMaki: No, let me say it too. Thank you for being here to visit the shrine with us, Yume.\r\nYume: Why are you thanking me now, Maki-onee-san!? This is weird, right? Yomi-onee-san!\r\nYomi: ...I'm the only one who hasn't said anything. Thank you all. Shidou-san, Konohana-san, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Not you too, Yomi-onee-san!?\r\nSuzuka: Fufu. You want to go flower viewing again this year as well, don't you, Yume?\r\nYume: Nn, I want to go, but... No sweet sake this time, okay?\r\nMaki: ...Fireworks, maybe at the summer festival, would be nice too, wouldn't it? I'd rather see them together than alone this time.\r\nYume: Fireworks!? I really wanna see that!\r\nYomi: Isn't there anything you want to do this year, Tsubakuro-san?\r\nYume: What I want to do...? Oh yeah! Seeing the autumn leaves!\r\nYomi: Understood. We can all go together.\r\nYume: And, what else~. I still have to beat Yukari-sama, so a whole bunch of people can see how great I am!\r\nYomi: There's a lot you want to do, isn't there. Shouldn't you have wished to the gods about it then?\r\nYume: Ehh~? I don't have to do that~. Cause... The four of us can make it all happen together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Q19Fa9VDWgg\r\n[VRS Equipment - Yume: Start]: Nothing to It but to Do It!\r\n\r\nMaki: [mumble mumble mumble]... \r\nYume: Geez, Maki-onee-san, how long're you going to keep reading the instructions for? \r\nMaki: Just give me a bit more time, Yume. I want to thoroughly drill myself on all the game commands, just in case a bug occurs in the game world.\r\nTsugumi: Shidou-san, I understand why you might feel unsure of using cutting edge technology, but I can assure you, this VR game Kitora-san and I helped to develop is perfectly safe. You have nothing to worry about.\r\nYume: That's right-, they say it's popular with other toji onee-sans too, so it's fine.\r\nMaki: Still, since they say it's an action shooting game, there's no way to avoid battling enemies, is there? If worse comes to worst, and I end up losing with a weapon I'm not used to...\r\nYume: Come on-, you take everything way too seriously, Maki-onee-san-.\r\nTsugumi: I have to agree. There is a battle stage in this VR game, but exploring the city is the main objective, so that won't be an issue.\r\nYume: See, this onee-san's saying the same thing. Let's get started already-.\r\nMaki: Just hang on! Only another 20 pages and I'll have finished the manual...\r\nYume: With these things, it's easy to just learn while playing-. Isn't it, Onee-san?\r\nTsugumi: I believe that everyone learns in different ways. Tsubakuro-san, if you're ever in trouble, please ask Shidou-san for the commands.\r\nYume: Okaaay! Maki-onee-san, as soon as you're ready, we're going in!\r\n\r\nYume: Wow-! Look, look! The city's all sparkly and pretty-. Ah, there's something up on the roof of that building! Let's go check it out!\r\nMaki: Hey, Yume! Wait for me! You can't run off on your own!\r\nYume: Ahaha! This is funnn! I know! Let's climb up to the top of that really high building! Hurry up, Maki-onee-san-!\r\nMaki: Hold on, I'll be right there! ...You know, while we're here, this world is incredible. We can jump ten times higher than usual. We got to the top of a high rise building in no time.\r\nYume: Ahh! There's a helicopter parked on the roof of the next building over! Think I can jump to there?\r\nMaki: Oi, hold it, Yume! Even here, a jump that far is going to be...\r\nMaki: Err... What was the long distance jump command...\r\nYume: I don't believe it-! Maki-onee-san, you even brought the instruction manual in here?\r\nMaki: There's times when we'll need to have it handy. Just hold on, Yume, I'm checking over the commands now...\r\nYume: Don't worry, it's easy peasy!  Here I gooo-! Juuump!\r\nMaki: Ahh-- Yume!\r\nYume: See, look! I jumped to this roof just fine-! You come too, Maki-onee-san-.\r\nMaki: Whoa! What's with the strength of this wind!? It'll be tough reaching there through this.\r\nMaki: I'll go after it dies down. Oiii, Yume, just to be sure, find somewhere safe to get out of the wind.\r\nYume: I'll be fine-. See, if I go all the way into the corner of the roof, I can get a really pretty view of the city at night down bel...\r\nYume: Wah----!\r\nMaki: Yume!\r\nYume: No way! I'm falling!?\r\nYume: Uhh, when this happens, what was I supposed to do? What do I do, Maki-onee-san!? I'm gonna fall all the way down!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[VRS Equipment - Yume: End]: Seriousness Pays Off\r\n\r\nMaki: Yume! Are you okay!? Yume-!!\r\nYume: Wahhh, what should I do! I'm falling all the way down---!\r\nYume: Maki-onee-chan, save me-!\r\nMaki: Yume! Are you okay? Grab onto my hand! \r\nYume: Maki-onee-san!\r\nMaki: Alright, I've got you. I'll take us down slowly, so don't leave my arms.\r\nYume: Okay, thanks... Wait, what! Maki-onee-san, you're flying!? How? How-?\r\nMaki: In this game world, there's a command to fly through the air.\r\nYume: Ehhh!? Nobody told me that-!\r\nMaki: It was written in the instruction manual. You should have read it.\r\nYume: Boo-. Instead of reading that big book, it seemed like it'd be faster learning by trying it yourself-.\r\nMaki: Sure, even if you memorize the manual, if you can't handle the controls when the time comes, there wasn't much point.\r\nYume: Still, it's because you took reading it so seriously that you saved me. Thanks.\r\n\r\nMaki: Here, Yume. We've landed safely.\r\nYume: Ahh~, thank goodness! \r\nYume: Hey hey, teach me how to fly in the sky too!\r\nMaki: Of course; it'd be dangerous if this happened again, after all. Watch me closely. You do this...\r\nYume: Okay, okay, like this?\r\nYume: Whoa-, that's crazy! I'm flying too!\r\nMaki: You're a natural, Yume. Just after seeing that complicated command one time, you already memorized it.\r\nYume: Hey hey, since I can fly now and all, well, I'm going to fly up to the top of the highest building!\r\nMaki: It does seem pretty high up there. Though, while we're in this world, we might as well enjoy it.\r\n\r\nYume: Wow-, it's super high up here on the roof! You can see all the night lights in the city-.\r\nMaki: Oi, Yume! If you walk on the edge of the building, you're going to fall like before!\r\nYume: I'm fine, I'm fine! Cause I can fly now! See, look!\r\nYume: Wawawa, I'm falling-!\r\nMaki: Yume! Did you lose your footing again!?\r\nYume: Just kidding! I'm fine; I remember how to fly, okay.\r\nMaki: Hey, Yume! Don't tease me like that...\r\nYume: Still, it's really amazing that you can do this here too! I'm glad I came here with someone who'd read the whole manual!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/l-T5v0sq5no\r\n[Hostess - Yume: Start]: Yume's Work Experience!\r\n\r\nMaki: ......\r\nMaki: ...Sigh.\r\nSuzuka: ...Why not relax some?\r\nSuzuka: It won't help anything to walk around in circles like you've been doing.\r\nSuzuka: Knowing you, you must be worried about Yume, aren't you?\r\nMaki: When I think about if Yume's doing her workplace experience trip right... I just can't settle down.\r\nSuzuka: The ryokan Yume left for has been hosting students of the Five Traditions for their workplace experience for years.\r\nSuzuka: We only asked if they would kindly take in Yume, despite not being part of the Five Traditions, and Yomi-san even went along with her.\r\nSuzuka: Nothing of concern is going to happen.\r\nMaki: Well, you're right... Yeah. I'll just focus on my own work.\r\n\r\nYomi: Tsubakuro-san, the last aradama is headed your way. Please take care of it.\r\nAradama: ...GGGGG!\r\nYume: Leave it to me-! HAAAAAAAAH!\r\nYume: Annnd done!\r\nYume: We were just about to get changed and help do hostess work, so don't get in our way anymore-.\r\nYomi: Good job. I'll contact the noro recovery team, so it's alright for you to return to the ryokan first, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Nnn-. I'll wait here too. I'd rather be with you, Onee-san.\r\nYomi: Alright then.\r\nYomi: You know, I was slightly surprised to see how proactive you were about your workplace experience.\r\nYume: You were? I've never really done this kind of thing before, so it feels sort of fresh!\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYomi: You don't often get a chance to work as a hostess, do you. This is my first time too, so it does feel fresh.\r\nYume: See~!\r\n\r\nYomi: There are no longer any signs of aradama in the area of the ryokan. Please rest assured.\r\nRyokan Proprietress: Thank you very much. It's such a help, having you two here.\r\nRyokan Proprietress: Because of you, our guests could go about within the ryokan without starting a panic.\r\nYume: No matter how many times aradama like that come along, I'll beat them right away, so you don't have to worry about it-.\r\nRyokan Proprietress: Fufu. Though, we would be worried, if aradama appeared that many times in the short time you're here.\r\nYume: Ah! I guess you're right.\r\nYume: Oh yeah. After we put on our hostess clothes, we were going to help out, but, what should we do?\r\nRyokan Proprietress: The work I'll have you do is nothing more than simple cleaning of the rooms, and a check over their furnishings.\r\nRyokan Proprietress: We have people hired to take care of the full cleaning, but this is one last check before the guests come through. Whoever is in charge will show you how it's done, so please work along with them.\r\nYume: Okaaay~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Hostess - Yume: End]: For the Special Menu!\r\n\r\nYume: I thought meeting guests and showing them their rooms felt like what a real hostess would do, but I didn't think, after we did it a couple times, they'd ask us to go pick vegetables next.\r\nYomi: They seem to have a special menu of vegetables grown here on the mountain they own that's served to guests who request it.\r\nYume: You think this is enough we've got-?\r\nYomi: It might be. It wouldn't be good if we gathered too many at once, so why don't we check with the ryokan for now.\r\nYume: Then, I'll go ask!\r\nYume: --Though, now that I'm looking closer... Onee-san. Were you picking only mushrooms? ...Why? Do you like them?\r\nYomi: There's no special reason. I just happened to. Though, these mushrooms have grown well.\r\nYomi: You could make a good soup stock from these shiitake, and their thickness would make them good for use in cooking.\r\nYume: I don't like them all that much, but, if the guests like it, it's fine.\r\nYomi: That would be best, wouldn't it.\r\nMaki: You look like you're working hard for the ryokan, Yume.\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san, Suzuka-onee-san!? Why're you here!?\r\nSuzuka: A certain someone was worried to death over you, so we came to see you in the end.\r\nMaki: Suzuka... You promised you wouldn't say anything.\r\nSuzuka: Oh, did I?\r\nYume: You're treating me like a kid again-. You didn't have to worry about me or anything. See, look. I'm doing my job juuust fine.\r\nMaki: Yeah, I can tell. Those all look tasty.\r\nSuzuka: I'll be looking forward to enjoying what you've picked for dinner.\r\nYume: You're having these for dinner!?\r\nSuzuka: We are. We made a reservation just now.\r\nSuzuka: I asked for all four of us, you and Yomi-san included, to sit for dinner together. So stick to your work until then.\r\nYume: Okay! Then, I'm going to get going!\r\n\r\nThe next day--\r\n\r\nYume: I wasn't used to doing any of that stuff, but that was pretty fun yesterday.\r\nYume: It seems like it'd be tough working as a hostess every day. There's a lot of rooms you have to clean and all.\r\nYomi: That was a fairly established ryokan.\r\nYume: Since we were all there, it would've been nice if all four of us could have slept over there together too.\r\nYume: But, we were only there for that workplace experience thing, so I get that it would've been hard setting up-.\r\nMaki: On top of that, we have work we can't afford to leave undone.\r\nSuzuka: Yesterday was truly a spur of the moment arrangement, so we couldn't make preparations. Though, it would be nice if the four of us could do something like that again someday.\r\nYume: Someday for sure!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/51zzPZJO6kY\r\n[Misogi - Yume: Start]: Why Won't You Let Me!\r\n\r\nYume: Maki-onee-san.\r\nMaki: Nn? Oh, it's you, Yume.\r\nMaki: Sorry, but I don't have a lot of time right now. If this'll take long, can we save it for later?\r\nYume: You always seem like you're busy, Maki-onee-san. What's going on today?\r\nMaki: We got a report about an aradama, but it seems like a pretty large scale one. There's nobody available who can handle it.\r\nYume: A large scale aradama!!\r\nYume: Then, isn't it okay if I go?\r\nMaki: You're here on standby, Yume.\r\nMaki: You don't need to do anything more than the work we give you.\r\nMaki: I have to get going.\r\nYume: ...She just left me. If there's a large scale aradama, they could've just told me.\r\nYume: Ahhh, this is so boring-. I could do it fine all by myself; I don't even need a unit or anything.\r\nYume: ...When I joined the elite guard, I thought I'd get to sortie a whole lot more and fight a bunch of tough aradama... But all I'm ever doing is waiting at home!\r\nYume: I can't show how off how strong I am at all like this...\r\nYume: ...I got it!\r\nYume: If I prove to them I'm strong, I bet they'll let me go on more sorties.\r\n\r\nYomi: You want to fight a match against me?\r\nYume: Yeah. Cause they aren't letting me go suppress any aradama at all.\r\nYume: So, if I beat all the onee-sans in the elite guard, you'll have to think I'm really strong.\r\nYomi: ...\r\nYomi: I don't feel there's any need for us to fight... The outcome is obvious.\r\nYume: But, you won't know that till we try it!\r\nYomi: ...Won't I?\r\nYume: Anyway... Here I come!\r\nYomi: ...gh.\r\nYume: H-Huh? Are you done already?\r\nYomi: ...The outcome was obvious.\r\nYume: Wait, that's what you meant!?\r\nYomi: This is as far as my skills with a sword go.\r\nYume: I can't show how strong I am with that... Aghh, geez, I'll go to the next one! Suzuka-onee-san!\r\n\r\nYume: YAAAH!!\r\nSuzuka: You're good, Yume!\r\nYume: You too, Suzuka-onee-san! But... if that's all you've got, this'll be over in no time!\r\nSuzuka: I thought that-- You would come like that!\r\nYume: Huh!?\r\nYume/Suzuka: --!!\r\nSuzuka: And I thought I had gotten you with that counter... So you can even react to that.\r\nYume: That got me by surprise! That was a little bit close there!\r\nSuzuka: ...Those reflexes of yours are frightening.\r\nYume: This is getting fun, right, Suzuka-onee-san? Let's do it some more!\r\n\r\nSuzuka: ...This is my loss. You are strong, Yume.\r\nYume: Yeah, I'm strong, right? So that's why, you can send me on a bunch more suppression missions, okay?\r\nSuzuka: ...R-Right, I'll keep that in mind.\r\nYume: All that's left is Maki-onee-san... and Yukari-sama. If I beat Yukari-sama, everybody'll know I'm strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Misogi - Yume: End]: I'll Get Even Stronger!\r\n\r\nMaki: I'm back.\r\nYume: I was waiting for you, Maki-onee-san.\r\nMaki: Yume...? Oh right, before I left to suppress that aradama, you were saying something.\r\nYume: ...Fight a match against me, Maki-onee-san.\r\nMaki: A match... As the first seat, that's something I can't afford to lose.\r\nYume: Well I'm not gonna lose either.\r\nYume: Cause I'll... I'm going to show tons of people just how strong I am.\r\n\r\nYume: ...Maki-onee-san hits so hard-. My hands are all tingly.\r\nMaki: What's the matter, Yume! If you're not going to come attack me, I'll end things like this!\r\nYume: I think you're getting ahead of yourself!\r\nMaki: Too soft!\r\nYume: What part!\r\nMaki: Tch!\r\nYume: You sure are strong, Maki-onee-san! But, I'm even stronger!\r\nMaki: That's something... you only get to say after you win!\r\nYume: Yeah... I'll win! I'm... stronger than you, Maki-onee-san!\r\n\r\nYume: Hooray-! I beat Maki-onee-san!\r\nMaki: Damnit... Am I supposed to feel frustrated that I lost, or proud my kouhai's grown so promising... These are some mixed up feelings.\r\nYume: So now you know I'm strong, right? And, starting tomorrow, you'll put me on lots of sorties?\r\nMaki: Sorties? Wait, that doesn't...\r\nYume: ...No good yet, huh. So I've gotta beat Yukari-sama after all...\r\nMaki: H-Hey, Yume? That's not what I meant...\r\nYume: I'm gonna go over there real quick, Maki-onee-san.\r\n\r\nYume: Yukari-sama~.\r\nYukari: Yume?

That is impressive.\r\nYume: If we didn't get this far, we'd both be bored, right, Yukari-sama?\r\nYume: So then, I'll do even more-!\r\nYume: That's what I want, Yukari-sama-!\r\nYukari: ...It's about time now. Sorry, Yume.\r\nYume: Uwah!?\r\nYukari: That's all for today.\r\nYume: J-Just one more time! If I don't beat you, they won't let me go on any sorties!\r\nYukari: Where did you get that idea? The reason you go on so few sorties is because Shidou and Konohana are concerned about your body.\r\nYume: Huh...? ...But, they never told me about that.\r\nYume: And anyway, Maki-onee-san and Suzuka-onee-san worry way too much!\r\nYukari: You shouldn't say that.\r\nYume: But still...\r\nYukari: ...Yume. You put up a fine attack. I'll play with you again, so stay diligent.\r\nYume: Okay!\r\nYume: (Ahh, that was so fun!

I have a request for you from the Sword Administration Bureau.\r\nSuzuka: A request?\r\nYume: Is it aradama!? Yukari-sama, did a really tough aradama show up!?\r\nYukari: ...That's not it. This request comes from the public relations department.\r\nYume: Really-? What a letdown-.\r\nYomi: What sort of request is it?\r\nYukari: You've been requested to participate in an indoor pool's event.\r\nYume: But there's no point in us going, is there?\r\nYukari: Don't say that, Yume.\r\nSuzuka: Listen to Yukari-sama, Yume. This too is fine work for the elite guard.\r\nYume: Then you onee-sans can go do it on your own.\r\nMaki: Yume! Don't act so spoiled.\r\nYukari: Then, Yume. After you finish this request, I'll be your opponent. It's been a while.\r\nYume: You mean it!? Then, I guess I have to go.\r\nYume: But, you have to promise, Yukari-sama!

I'll have to get notes ready in advance for the speech.\r\nSuzuka: Wait, Maki-san. I'll take care of that.\r\nMaki: Thanks, Suzuka. I'm leaving it to you.\r\nSuzuka: Of course; you can rely on me.\r\nYukari: Though, about your assignment this time... You won't be part of a ceremony.\r\nYukari: You will be giving a dance performance as part of the pool's Arabian event.\r\nYume: Eh...!?\r\nYume: Instead of listening to some boring speeches at a ceremony, we're dancing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1,001 Nights - Yume: End]: A Promise for Next Time \r\n\r\n--The day of the event.\r\n\r\nMaki: We have to wear these!?\r\nYume: You don't like it, Maki-onee-san? They're so cute though.\r\nMaki: Look how much stomach it shows... I can't wear something that cute!\r\nSuzuka: Yes... It's embarrassing for me as well. \r\nYume: Why don't you want to wear it that bad though?\r\nYume: It doesn't really feel like something you'd say, Maki-onee-san. You'd be more like, \"All clothes are the same-!\"\r\nMaki: ...I don't think all clothes are the same.\r\nMaki: And I'm just... a little self-conscious about my stomach.\r\nYume: You mean cause it'll be cold?\r\nMaki: That's not it.\r\nMaki: ...Isn't my stomach way too toned compared to everybody?\r\nSuzuka: My, were you really worried about that?\r\nYume: You're a real workout monster, Maki-onee-san-.\r\nYomi: We're out of time, everyone. Please hurry and change.\r\nYume: Okaaay.\r\nSuzuka: So she says. Time to find your resolve, Maki-san...\r\nMaki: But... Gh, I guess this is a mission too!\r\n\r\nYume: Hmhmhmm~! And, turn here!\r\nYume: Ahaha! I didn't think dancing would be this fun!\r\nMaki: You were the one who didn't want to do this the most at first, Yume, and now you're having the most fun with it.\r\nSuzuka: Isn't it charming to see her act her age?\r\nMaki: ...That's true.\r\nYume: Geez! Maki-onee-san, you're messing up the rhythm.\r\nMaki: Huh!?\r\nYomi: ...\r\nYume: Yomi-onee-san, you've gotta smile more!\r\nYomi: ...Was I not smiling?\r\nYume: You haven't smiled for a second-!\r\nSuzuka: Fufu, an event like this isn't so bad, is it, Yume.\r\nYume: Yeah! I want us all to do this again!\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/0OSG6EeTdH8\r\n[Mahou Shoujo - Yume: Start]: Let's Go Together!\r\n\r\nYume: Where'd she go... Ah, there you are! Fate-chan!\r\nFate: Yume-san?\r\nYume: Huh? What're you doing with Maki-onee-san?\r\nMaki: I was just hearing from her about the incident going on. What did you need, Yume?\r\nYume: Aradama showed up, so I came to get her. Let's go together, Fate-chan.\r\nFate: Aradama...? But...\r\nMaki: It's fine with me. Though, when you get back, I might have to talk with you again...\r\nFate: ...Thank you, Maki-san.\r\nFate: If helping out could reduce the damage they cause by even a little, I'll go along with you.\r\nYume: Neat! I'll be sure to show you a whole bunch of how strong I am!\r\nFate: Eh? But I know that you're strong, Yume-san.\r\nYume: I can't wait! Let's get there fast, Fate-chan!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: They've arrived at last... Oh? Why is Harlaown-san here?\r\nFate: I accepted Yume-san's invitation to help.\r\nNanoha: Ah, it's Fate-chan.\r\nFate: Wait, Nanoha?\r\nTsugumi: I asked Takamachi-san to assist me. We were working together just before this.\r\nNanoha: Yomi-san was actually with us too, but she had to go someplace else.\r\nFate: Is that how it happened. Let's do what we can, Nanoha.\r\nNanoha: Sure, Fate-chan!\r\nYume: So anyway, why're you just standing around doing nothing here?\r\nTsugumi: We were waiting for you, Tsubakuro-san.\r\nYume: Oh, you were? Then, you can go back and leave the rest to me, Onee-san.\r\nTsugumi: I probably could-.\r\nTsugumi: We won't go back, but I'll count on you to do your best.\r\nYume: Sure! \r\nFate: Umm... Is this going to be okay, Tsugumi-san?\r\nTsugumi: Is what okay?\r\nFate: The aradama... Isn't it going to be hard when they show up? I don't get that feeling from Yume-san...\r\nTsugumi: Tsubakuro-san is plenty strong though-.\r\nTsugumi: Since she doesn't struggle fighting aradama, there's not much sense of danger, so perhaps a part of her merely thinks of it as an extended game.\r\nFate: Then, why is it that Yume-san became a toji?\r\nTsugumi: Only Tsubakuro-san knows the answer to that.\r\nTsugumi:  Though... Everything will be fine.\r\nFate: Eh?\r\nTsugumi: Tsubakuro-san is a toji too. Please have faith in her.\r\nFate: ...Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mahou Shoujo - Yume: End]: It's Not Like That!?\r\n\r\nAradama: GUOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!\r\nYume: YAAH!\r\nAradama: Oooo...\r\nYume: Geez, there's nothing but weak aradama here!\r\nYume: How am I supposed to show Fate-chan how strong I am like this!\r\nFate: You don't need to go that far, Yume-san.\r\nFate: I think it's incredible how you can defeat aradama the moment we find them.\r\nYume: That's not really that incredible or anything.\r\nFate: ...\r\nFate: Why did you become a toji, Yume-san?\r\nYume: Ehh? To show people what makes me so strong.\r\nFate: What makes you strong?\r\nYume: Yeah. That's why, I thought I'd get to show you too, Fate-chan, but...\r\nYume: Wait, I know!\r\nFate: Yume-san?\r\nYume: Since we have the chance, let's have some fun while we do this... Fate-chan!\r\nFate: --!?\r\nYume: Aha! Fighting with you really is fun, Fate-chan!\r\nFate: We're in the middle of a mission right now!\r\nYume: Yeah! So, while we do the mission, let's fight, Fate-chan!\r\nFate: Kh... Stop this, Yume-san!\r\nYume: I'm not gonna!\r\nAradama: BGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nYume: You're in the way!\r\nFate: (Yume-san... She actually is defeating aradama while fighting me.)\r\nFate: (Showing others what makes her strong... Is that really so important to Yume-san?)\r\nYume: C'mon, c'mon! What's wrong, Fate-chan!\r\nFate: --! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nAradama: ooooo...\r\nFate: I'll be your opponent, but I'll only attack the aradama...\r\nFate: Will that be alright?\r\nYume: ...Aha! It's fine with me!\r\nTsugumi: Okay, that's enough-.\r\nYume: Ehhh!?

I was making sure to do the mission!?\r\nYume: Geez, and it was just getting fun too.

Today's special guest is... Mihono-chan!\r\nMihono: Umm. Hi, Yanase-san. Sorry if I'm being a bother.\r\nMihono: I ran into Kanami before, and she said I should tag along, so...\r\nMai: Don't worry, it's fine. Sorry I invited you here so abruptly, Asakura-san, Kanami-chan.\r\nMihono: Ah, something smells really good!\r\nKanami: Mai-chan, you made that, didn't you! The stuff that's all sticky and smooth~.\r\nMai: That's right. I can't believe you figured it out already, Kanami-chan. I made pudding, but actually...\r\nMai: Ah, you should try some first! I just hope it turned out alright.\r\nKanami: Everything you make turns out great, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: ...R-Right.\r\nMihono: ...Yanase-san? What's wrong? You look upset about something.\r\nMai: Sorry, it's nothing! Here, come on inside!\r\n\r\nMihono: Whoa, it looks delicious. You sure I can eat this!?\r\nMai: Of course. If you're sure you want some, go right ahead.\r\nKanami: No one in the world wouldn't want your cooking, Mai-chan! Anyway, I'm digging in-!\r\nMihono: Me too! Down the hatch-!\r\nKanami: Mhmmm, ahh...\r\nMihono: It's... It's too yummy!\r\nMai: Thank goodness. But, um... Was there anything else that you noticed about it?\r\nKanami: It's just really tasty.\r\nMihono: Yeah, it's so tasty!\r\nMai: Th-Thank you. But, let's see, for example, if it tastes like anything you've tried before...\r\nMai: Like, maybe, a certain shop's pudding...\r\nKanami: Anything I've tried? Umm... Mihono-chan, what do you think?\r\nMihono: I don't really... Go out shopping much, so I don't know. But, Yanase-san, I feel like your pudding's better than anything I could buy?\r\nKanami: Yeah, I feel the same! I've never had anything like it. Mai-chan, your pudding's amazing!\r\nMai: ...A-Ahaha, thank you.\r\nKanami: Mai-chan? Something's bothering you, isn't it?\r\nMai: It's not a big deal... This was just a bit of a failure.\r\nMihono: Eh, how!?\r\nMai: To tell the truth, I was trying to copy the pudding from a shop I love.\r\nKanami: A shop Mai-chan loves... \"Plumeria\"?\r\nKanami: Ahh... Mmm? Now that you mention it, it tastes sort of alike, I think?\r\nMihono: (Ughh, I can't believe I said I don't go out much...)\r\nMai: No, don't worry about it, Kanami-chan... After all, it'd be strange if I could copy a famous chef's pudding so easily.\r\nMai: My little sisters, they told me they wanted to be able get the same taste at home. So I kept on practicing time and time again, and kept going to eat the real thing to compare, and I used all the same materials, just as fresh...!\r\nMihono: Yanase... San?\r\nMai: I tried heating with different intensity, and steaming it differently, and lots of different containers. But why, even though I keep on trying... No, I just can't get it to taste any good.\r\nMai: I love cooking sweets so much, but in the end I'm just an amateur...\r\nKanami: You're frustrated, huh, Mai-chan.\r\nMai: Eh, you can tell...?\r\nMihono: It's kind of hard not to notice, I think?\r\nMai: Oh no, I'm sorry. I just got carried away.\r\nKanami: It's alright. I almost never get to see you like this, after all.\r\nMai: Eh?\r\nKanami: You're usually so calm and composed, and it feels like you can do anything. But seeing you act like this is pretty cute too. Right, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Yeah, I feel like my image of Yanase-san changed a little!\r\nMai: Eh... Really...?\r\nKanami: Hey, do you want to try this again, Mai-chan? I'll sample it as much as you want. You'll join in too, right, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Yeah, if you'll let me, I'll try some anytime. Today's was good too! I mean it; it was really yummy!\r\nMai: Asakura-san, Kanami-chan...\r\nMai: Thank you. I'm so glad I had you two taste it.\r\nMai: I'm a little depressed, but I'll keep on trying... I'll challenge it again, I promise!\r\nKanami: Yeah! I'm looking forward to it. But if you mess up, that's okay. It just means we get to eat even more!\r\nMihono: I think I'd be happy with that too?\r\nMai: Geez, cut it out, you two. Next time I'll get it right for sure! ...Fufu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: What is Femininity?\r\n\r\nMai: What should I do with these? I made too many cookies. Kanami-chan would be able to eat them all, but... She isn't back yet.\r\nKiyoka: Thank goodness, I got this month's edition. I have to get back to my room and read the latest report-\r\nMai: Eh!?\r\nKiyoka: Kyaa!\r\n*the two collide*\r\nMai: Oww... S-Sorry. I was lost in thought.\r\nKiyoka: No, I wasn't looking where I was going...! I'm so sorry!!\r\nMai: Um, you're Musumi-san, right? Are you hurt? This magazine... It's yours, isn't it? Here.\r\nKiyoka: Thank you so much! And I really am sorry. You're... Yanase-san, aren't you?\r\nMai: Yes. From Minoseki.\r\nKiyoka: Ahhhh!! Yanase-san, when I bumped into you just now, did those...!?\r\nMai: Oh my. The cookies... They got crushed, didn't they? But please, don't worry about it.\r\nKiyoka: I'm so sorry, were they a present from someone? I'll buy you replacements.\r\nMai: Oh, these are just something I made myself. Really, it's not worth fussing over.\r\nKiyoka: Eh!? You mean those are handmade!? They look so cute...\r\nMai: They might be a little broken, but would you like to try them?\r\nKiyoka: Can I!?\r\n\r\nKiyoka: These are delicious...! Can you share the recipe with me, Yanase-san?\r\nMai: Recipe? ...I don't really use them. I just go with what feels right when I'm cooking.\r\nMai: More importantly, Musumi-san, there's crumbs getting on your magazine...! Here, lay this handkerchief on top of it.\r\nMai: Ah, that's right. Take a tissue as well, so you can wipe your hands.\r\nKiyoka: ...You're so feminine, Yanase-san.\r\nMai: Eh?\r\nKiyoka: I'm jealous...! I could never be so considerate, and cooking without a recipe would just be impossible for me...\r\nMai: It's not like that. Baking things is just my hobby. When I'm cooking, I can really lose myself in it, and when I'm done, I like seeing others enjoy it.\r\nMai: What about you, Musumi-san? What do you do in your spare time?\r\nKiyoka: Eh, me...? Reading, is about all I do.\r\nMai: Reading? What kind of books do you read?\r\nKiyoka: L-Love stories, mostly. And, I read magazines... Like this one.\r\nMai: Is that so. Let me see... \"The Number 1 Must Buys This Season, Introducing Kamo Chinami's Mix and Match Technique\"...\r\nKiyoka: This report is always so handy. If you pick out whatever appears in here, it can make any outfit look cuter.\r\nKiyoka: It's a big help in picking out accessories, for example, or, i-if I ever go on a date, what to wear...\r\nMai: R-Really? Musumi-san, you seem so... Mature.\r\nKiyoka: Eh....? Yanase-san, are you not interested in this kind of thing?\r\nMai: I-I never really thought about it much.\r\nKiyoka: I don't know that much about it myself. I just think, whenever I'm going out, that I should be a little fashionable. If someone ever thinks I'm cute, well...\r\nKiyoka: That'd be wonderful.\r\nMai: Somehow, I feel like... You're already pretty wonderful, Musumi-san. Talking to you like this, it's like you're sparkling.\r\nMai: It's normal for girls to be interested in wearing cute clothes, isn't it? But I'm clueless when it comes to this...\r\nKiyoka: In that case, Yanase-san! I'll lend you this magazine!\r\nMai: Eh?\r\nKiyoka: If you read it, I'm sure you'll feel much better about fashion. Think of it as a thank you for these cute cookies.\r\nKiyoka: I really wish I could make you cookies like these as thanks, but it seems too difficult for me...\r\nMai: Musumi-san... Thank you. But, isn't this this month's issue? You can give it to me after you're through reading it.\r\nMai: Oh, before then... If you're interested, how about we bake cookies together next time?\r\nMai: It doesn't have to be cookies either. We can make all sorts of cute sweets that'll get you all worked up.\r\nKiyoka: Eh!? You don't mind me joining you?\r\nMai: Of course not. When it comes to making sweets, I have some experience. And, next time...\r\nMai: I'd like it if you shared with me some of your magazines.\r\nKiyoka: That sounds great! I'll bring all kinds with me!\r\nMai: Fufu. Then, until next time. It's a promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: As a Toji\r\n\r\nChie: Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan! It seems like... We managed to deal with all the aradama.\r\nChie: It's all thanks to the help of our reinforcement. I'm Setouchi Chie. And you are...?\r\nMai: Yanase Mai, from Minoseki. I'm a classmate of Asakura-san... Of Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: You saved us-! Thanks, Mai. That's Minoseki's tournament rep for you; you were awesome back there!\r\nMihono: Ahhh, oh yeah! Musumi-san, are you okay?\r\nKiyoka: Yes... Um, sorry, I'm just... I'm not very good at fighting...\r\nKiyoka: Kya! Another aradama!\r\nChie: Still...!? Yanase-san, our teammates should be returning any minute, so could you help us a little longer?\r\nMai: Of course!\r\n\r\nChie: Minoseki's representative... I can see why. Even against those aradama, your posture never faltered, and your swordsmanship stayed clean.\r\nMihono: See? I told you she's good, Chii-nee.\r\nMai: Th-Thank you.\r\nMihono: And, on top of that, she's a super rich girl. She's got a butler and everything!\r\nKiyoka: A butler... That sounds kind of amazing.\r\nKiyoka: B-But wait, then why are you a toji? It's a dangerous position. For a high class girl like you...\r\nMihono: You're right, it's a little weird. But being a toji is a really respectable position, isn't it? Maybe her family wanted her to do it or something.\r\nMai: ...I decided to become a toji and worked towards it on my own.\r\nMai: It's dangerous work, but it also keeps everyone safe. So I wanted to try it.\r\nMai: Luckily, I was capable of using an okatana, and one of them accepted me.\r\nChie: You sound so responsible. At least, I wouldn't expect that from a middle schooler.\r\nMihono: Why're you looking at me, Chii-nee.\r\nKiyoka: But, aren't you scared?\r\nMai: I do get scared. Though, when I grip my okatana, all those feelings fade away.\r\nMai: I train with that in mind, and somehow I manage.\r\nMihono: That's so cool, Mai. It's like you have a totally different kind of strength than Kanami.\r\nChie: You have to try your best too, Mihono-chan. Starting with your concentration... Right?\r\nMihono: Ahaha... I need to work on that, huh...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Late Night Cookies\r\n\r\nMai: Excuse me...\r\nMai: Umm... Itomi Sayaka-chan...? I'm Yanase Mai, a second year middle schooler at Minoseki Academy. Could I talk to you for a little while...?\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nMai: Uh, well, I heard you fought with the runaway Kanami-chan and Juujou-san...\r\nSayaka: ...They escaped. Because I lost.\r\nMai: So Kanami-chan's safe... What a relief.\r\nMai: ...Ah, s-sorry? I really shouldn't be saying that to you.\r\nSayaka: ...It's just the truth that I lost.\r\nMai: But isn't that why you're being confined to this room...?\r\nSayaka: ...Because I failed my orders, after all.\r\nMai: ......\r\nMai: ...Sayaka-chan, there's a cut on your cheek.\r\nMai: You really shouldn't leave that alone. Is it okay if I put a band-aid on it?\r\nSayaka: Mm...\r\nMai: There... That should do it. And, if you'd like, have some of these!\r\nSayaka: ...?\r\nMai: I made too many cookies. Do you like sweets, Sayaka-chan?\r\nSayaka: ...Mm. Ah, um, yes...\r\nMai: Great. Then, I'd be happy if you had some.\r\nSayaka: Happy...?\r\nMai: Anyway, if they find me here, I'll get in trouble, so I'd better go now.\r\nMai: Thank you for talking to me. I'll see you later.\r\nSayaka: ...Mm...\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nSayaka: ...(crunch crunch).\r\nSayaka: ...It's good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Are You Fine with That?\r\n\r\nMai: ...Sigh.\r\nHashima Ema: Yanase-san.\r\nMai: Ah... President?\r\nEma: Those two will be alright.\r\nEma: Though, of course you'd be worried. She's your best friend, after all.\r\nMai: After what happened, there's been so much on my mind.\r\nMai: I'm worried about Kanami-chan. At the same time, I'm sure if anyone can get through this, it's Kanami-chan.\r\nMai: But...\r\nEma: There's something else bothering you, isn't there?\r\nMai: I just, don't know what to think anymore. How should I go on as a toji after this?\r\nMai: I don't have Kanami-chan's pure love for swordfighting. I don't have the drive to get stronger like her.\r\nMai: This may sound imprudent, but... I don't have the resolve Juujou-san must have had to turn her blade on Origami Yukari-sama either.\r\nMai: Being a toji means keeping everyone safe, and I came this far because I thought of it as a commendable job.\r\nMai: But... Is that really enough?\r\nEma: I don't think there's anything wrong with you advancing through a sense of pride. But you're feeling uncomfortable with that now, aren't you, Yanase-san?\r\nEma: Hmm, then... In that case, I think you're a little mistaken in what you said.\r\nMai: In what I said?\r\nEma: Truthfully, it's not about this being a commendable job, but because you wanted to become a toji who could protect others. And you're wondering if that desire alone is enough. Am I wrong?\r\nMai: ...!\r\nEma: There are those with a deep love of swordfighting, and those who hide strong convictions. Comparatively, your desire might not seem like much. Not enough to risk your life over.\r\nEma: If that's what's bothering you, I think I understand.\r\nMai: ...You might be right. But, I'm not sure. I can't tell if what I aspired to be was simply because I thought it was praiseworthy.\r\nMai: Seeing Kanami-chan and Juujou-san, I can't help but think I was being naive...\r\nMai: I'm wondering, if I should really continue with this...\r\nEma: Fufu. Don't worry.\r\nMai: President...?\r\nEma: I can't say for sure whether you should continue.\r\nMai: You can't say...?\r\nEma: That's right. However, don't belittle your desires. That's where all your strength is born from.\r\nEma: Yanase-san. You don't have to rush. Collect your thoughts, and have faith in yourself. When the time comes, you'll clearly see the path you should follow again.\r\nEma: With that, I need to leave for the night.\r\nMai: President...\r\nMai: ...I understand. I'll try having a little more faith in myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/d4UPDxCWrUY\r\n[Misogi- Mai: Start]: My First Shock\r\n\r\n--After being accepted to Minoseki Academy.\r\n\r\nMinoseki Academy Teacher: Alright, this might be your first swordfighting lesson after entering Minoseki Academy, but...\r\nKanami: I know! I'm really excited for it!\r\nMai: (That girl, her name was... Etou-san, wasn't it? So she was looking forward to our swordfighting lessons that much...)\r\nMinoseki Academy Teacher: Looks like we've got a lively one with us. To start us off, we'll have you learn what your classmates are capable of.\r\nMinoseki Academy Teacher: You'll be fighting against everyone... But first, pair up with the person next to you!\r\nKanami: I'll be in your care, Yanase-san!\r\nMai: S-Sure, likewise.\r\nMai: (We'll have to fight each of our classmates? Which would mean, I'll have to think about how to conserve my energy...)\r\nMinoseki Academy Teacher: Now then... Begin!\r\nKanami: ......\r\nMai: (Wait, she's not attacking?)\r\nMai: (That's sort of a let-down. With how she was acting, I thought she'd come straight at me as soon as we began...)\r\nKanami: I'm ready anytime.\r\nMai: (Her stance is... Seigan. It's so orthodox that there doesn't seem to be any scheme behind it. There's no need for tricks like that in our very first lesson anyway.)\r\nMai: (In which case... I'll go!)\r\nMai: YAAAAH!\r\nKanami: -!\r\nMai: ...Eh!?\r\nMai: (She dodged it... And so easily too...)\r\nKanami: There's hardly any wasted movements... You love swordfighting too, don't you, Yanase-san!\r\nKanami: Show me more of your swordsmanship!\r\n\r\nMinoseki Academy Teacher: That's enough!\r\nMai: Pant, pant...\r\nMai: (I wasn't any match for her at all... Etou-san, just who are you...)\r\nKanami: Yanase-san, you're so strong!\r\nMai: You too, Etou-san...\r\nKanami: Just call me Kanami!\r\nMai: (There's somebody... This amazing here... Etou... Kanami...)\r\nMai: Kanami-chan...\r\nKanami: Yeah, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: -!\r\nMai: Etou... Kanami-chan...\r\n\r\nFriend A: Mai's been together with Kanami all the time lately, hasn't she?\r\nMai: ...Eh?\r\nFriend B: Ah, I was thinking the same thing. Ever since that swordfighting lesson, right?\r\nFriend A: Well, Kanami was pretty amazing.\r\nMai: Th-That's only because... See, Kanami-chan may be strong, but, don't you think she's unsafe in some ways? Like, she might prioritize swordfighting over her own well being...\r\nFriend B: You say that, but isn't the truth that you just wound up having a crush on her?\r\nMai: I do not!! Don't go making assumptions like that!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Misogi- Mai: End]: The Name of This Feeling is Admiration\r\n\r\nFriend A: Eh, Mai...?\r\nMai: I-I'm sorry! There's something the teacher asked me to take care of!\r\nKanami: ...\r\n\r\nMai: ...Sigh.\r\nMai: (Why did I get so upset when she said that... I'd better... apologize to her, shouldn't I...)\r\nMai: (But... I don't understand it myself, why I reacted like that... I could tell right away she was only joking...)\r\nMai: But, Kanami-chan...\r\nKanami: You called?\r\nMai: K-Kanami-chan!? Why are you...?\r\nKanami: Actually... I saw what happened before. And then, I followed you here.\r\nKanami: If it's alright with you, you can talk it over with me, okay?\r\nMai: ...Thank you, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: Why'd you get so mad? Can I ask you that?\r\nMai: That's because...\r\nMai: (I can't exactly tell her it's because they asked if I liked you, can I...)\r\nMai: It was my fault. They were only teasing me a little, but I got seriously upset...\r\nKanami: ...Was it because, they made fun of something important to you?\r\nMai: Eh?\r\nKanami: When I think, \"If it were me, what would I get mad if someone made fun of?\", it's got to be swordfighting of course!\r\nMai: Fufu, I could see that, Kanami-chan.\r\nMai: (But then... That means, I got upset because Kanami-chan is important to me?)\r\nKanami: And also... If somebody made fun of somebody you respect, you'd feel bad too, wouldn't you?\r\nMai: Someone you respect... Yeah, respect! That's it, Kanami-chan!\r\nMai: Thank you for letting me talk this over with you!\r\nKanami: Sure! Wait, huh? Thinking back, I feel like I was the one doing all the talking...\r\nMai: Still, that's fine! I'm going to go apologize to them!\r\n\r\nMai: I'm sorry!\r\nFriend A: No, we're the ones who should be saying sorry. We were being sort of insensitive.\r\nFriend B: We were. But, I didn't think that you actually did like Kanami... We'll do what we can to support you two, Mai!\r\nMai: Eh!? Th-That's not it! You misunderstand!\r\nFriend A: ...It's not?\r\nMai: That's right. Kanami-chan, she's the first opponent I didn't think I could beat in swordfighting, so I respect her a lot.\r\nMai: But, when you teased me about it... I think that's why I couldn't help but get angry all of a sudden.\r\nFriend A: So that's what it was. It happens, huh.\r\nMai: We might be the same age, but... Kanami-chan was just so much stronger. That's why... Someday, I'd like to be about as strong as Kanami-chan.\r\nFriend B: She definitely is. We'll have to work real hard ourselves-.\r\nMai: Mmhm! Let's all work hard enough that we won't lose to Kanami-chan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/aNyvrlT3j5M\r\n[Dress - Mai: Start]: Nene's Madness\r\n\r\nKaoru: Gulp, gulp, gulp... Phwaa! Gimme another glass of grape juice!\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nMai: Kaoru-chan, I think you've had enough grape juice...\r\nKaoru: Don't stop me! Cause you know, there's a life of taking the overnight bus north to south and back waiting for me ahead!\r\nKaoru: How'm I supposed to get through that without drinking this!\r\nNene: Nene!\r\nMai: Still...\r\nKaoru: Hey, Mai... Have you ever rode on an overnight bus?\r\nMai: I haven't...\r\nKaoru: See? It's a place where you can never get a good sleep, you'll get woken up at every service area, your strength gets worn down hour after hour...\r\nMai: Kaoru-chan... Are you drunk?\r\nKaoru: Who gets drunk off grape juice! But I can't make it if I don't drink!\r\nMai: I-I see.\r\nKaoru: Ahh... It's good.\r\nKaoru: This big piece of chicken too, and that roast beef I had before, they used some pretty high grade meat, right?\r\nNene: Ne-?\r\nKaoru: Nn? Nene, you want this meat? You can't, it's mine.\r\nNene: Ne!\r\nKaoru: I'm the one who got it, so it's my meat!\r\nNene: Ne-...\r\nKaoru: Anyway, that dress looks good on you, Mai.\r\nMai: Thank you, Kaoru-chan. You look good in yours too.\r\nKaoru: What, this? They didn't have many dresses in my size, y'know-.\r\nMai: They didn't?\r\nKaoru: Yeah. They had a whole bunch in the size just above mine though.\r\nNene: NE--------!\r\nMai: Kyaa!\r\nKaoru: Nene stole my meat!?\r\nNene: Ne!\r\nKaoru: Stop it, Nene!

I'll get some more for you.\r\nKaoru: That's not gonna work! That was the last of the meat there!\r\nMai: Oh dear-...\r\nKaoru: And Nene, he knew that, and he still went after my meat!\r\nNene: Nene-!\r\nMai: S-Still, if you want meat, there's plenty of other kinds laid out...\r\nKaoru: But that's the last of that kind of meat!\r\nMai: Ah...\r\nKaoru: Kukuku, I've got you cornered now, Nene...\r\nKaoru: Okay, time to choose. You gonna give my meat back... Or aren't you? If you give it back now, I'll forgive you...?\r\nNene: Nenenenenenenene!\r\nKaoru: Ah-! You jackass, you ate it all in one go!\r\nNene: Ne?\r\nMai: I think it's a little late to be playing innocent, Nene...\r\nKaoru: You're getting it now, Nene!\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nMai: Kyaa!\r\nKaoru: You dumbass! Don't go jumping at Mai!\r\nNene: Ne!?\r\nKaoru: We're safe... That was close. You know better than that; if you'd jumped on her just after eating, you'd get her dress dirty.\r\nNene: Ne-...\r\nMai: Thank you... Kaoru-chan. Nene-chan, I'll wipe your mouth for you.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nKaoru: Can I leave Nene with you? I'm going to go get some meat.\r\nMai: Sure, that's fine with me.\r\nKaoru: Then, I'm off... This time, I'd better get some for Nene so he won't steal mine.\r\nMai: ...So she says.

Like, one that plays wind instruments?\r\nEma: Yes, that kind of marching band. And, that's where I'd like you to be the drum major... In other words, you'll be the conductor of the band.\r\nMai: You want me to do that...?\r\nEma: Yes. I think it would be a good experience for you. How do you feel about it?\r\nMai: ......\r\nMai: (A conductor... Can I really do it? I'm not so sure, but... the president must be suggesting this because she's sure I can.)\r\nMai: ...Alright then. I'll take on the role of the drum major!\r\n\r\nMai: So now, we'll begin practicing.\r\nMai: ......\r\nKanami: (Here I do it like this, and then like this...

And anyway, sorry, Mai. I screwed up again.\r\nMai: It's alright; we still have time. I'll stick with you, so let's practice lots, okay?\r\nMihono: Sure!\r\n\r\nMai: That's enough practicing for today. You did great, everyone!\r\nEveryone: Good work-!\r\nMihono: Ahh, I'm beat! Let's go get something sweet to eat, Mai, Kanami!\r\nKanami: Yeah, okay.\r\nMai: Ah, sorry, Mihono-chan. I have something to take care of...\r\nMihono: Oh... That's too bad.\r\nKanami: We'll see you tomorrow then, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: Sure!\r\nMihono: Wanna come too, Futaba-?\r\nFutaba: I'll pass!\r\nMai: Everyone's gone, so now I need to do my own practice.\r\nMai: ......\r\nMai: (They're all practicing their hardest. I have to try even harder too!)\r\nMai: --I messed up! I won't make it like this... One more try!\r\n\r\nMihono: Ughh, I messed up a bunch, Kanamiii. I made a lot of trouble for Mai too.\r\nKanami: But still, you've gotten a lot better, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: You think so!?\r\nKanami: Yeah!\r\nMihono: Then, that's good to hear! She's taught how to do a whole lot, so I want to make sure the main performance is a success for sure.\r\nKanami: Mai-chan's trying so hard for this. I'm sure she's probably practicing right now too.\r\nMihono: ...Ah, if she's teaching me this stuff, that must mean she practiced it enough to learn it that well herself.\r\nMihono: ...Sorry, Kanami! I'm going to go back and practice with Mai too!\r\nKanami: I had a feeling you'd say something like that!

Everyone tried so hard during practice, after all...\r\nKanami: That's why we'll definitely pull this off.\r\nMai: ...\r\nMai: How can... you be so sure?\r\nKanami: That's cause everybody knows by now. Just how much effort you've been putting into this.\r\nMai: How much I have...?\r\nKanami: Yeah. You've been trying so hard that it made everybody else work even harder.\r\nMai: They did...\r\nKanami: That's why I just know this'll go great.

Okay!)\r\nKanami: (You can really tell how much everybody practiced! I'm not about to let them show me up either!)\r\nMai: (That's amazing...!

Ah, you're right! I got a message from Sayaka-chan saying, \"That was great.\"\r\nMai: And there's ones from Ellen-chan and Kaoru-chan and everyone too...

A Bit Overly Helpful?\r\n\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan. Are you getting things ready for tomorrow? If you'd like, I can help you?\r\nSayaka: I got ready yesterday. I put what I needed in my bag, just in case.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan, that's great!\r\nSayaka: I also made sure to put in my swimsuit and a change of clothes. Should I bring a swim ring too?\r\nMai: If you want one to go down the river, it sounds like the campsite will rent them to you, so I think you'll be fine without.\r\nMai: It'll be easier for you if you have less to bring along.\r\nMai: (I can't help myself from wanting to look after Sayaka-chan, but since she's a serious girl, she can at least get the preparations done on her own.)\r\nSayaka: Then, I won't bring it. I'm really looking forward to tubing down the river tomorrow. I want to do it with you.\r\nMai: Mm, let's do it together. I'm sure it'll be fun and feel great.\r\nSayaka: And also, I'm looking forward to eating your cooking at the camp. I might not eat breakfast before we leave.\r\nMai: You should at least eat breakfast before we go. Though, I'm glad to hear you're excited for my cooking.\r\nSayaka: Okay, I will. What will you make?\r\nMai: Since Chie-san is going along with us, I talked with her, and we'll basically be doing a barbecue.\r\nMai: We can't do anything too elaborate with it, after all.\r\nMai: I think you'll have fun and it would be even tastier if you try barbecuing some meat and vegetables yourself, Sayaka-chan.\r\nSayaka: I don't know how to cook... But, I'll try it.\r\nMai: You'll be fine. I'll be there with you, and I know you can do it.\r\nMai: And then, we also talked about using a big iron plate and making enough yakisoba for everyone.\r\nMai: So long as we bring noodles, we can make it with the ingredients from the barbecue.\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nSayaka: ...From talking about food, I started feeling a little hungry.\r\nMai: I know what you mean. Talking like this makes you feel hungry, doesn't it?\r\nMai: But, it's probably best if you don't eat this late.\r\nSayaka: Mm... I'll hold off. I have to brush my teeth soon.\r\nMai: In that case, I'll be going back to my room.\r\nSayaka: I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight, Mai.\r\nMai: Mmhm, goodnight.\r\nSayaka: Ah... Wait.\r\nMai: Hm? What is it?\r\nSayaka: Tomorrow... If you can, I want you to call me when you wake up... I'm not sure I can wake up on my own.\r\nSayaka: ...Is that okay?\r\nMai: That's fine. I'll give you a call. And, if that doesn't wake you up, I'll come get you up myself.\r\nSayaka: Please do that. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Swimsuit 20 - Mai: End]: Swim Ring Tubing!\r\n\r\nMihono: That was good-. Why is it that meat tastes so much better eating under a big blue sky?\r\nMihono: Ah, and of course, the yakisoba you and Mai made was really yummy too, Chii-nee!\r\nChie: I'm glad you liked it. Ah, Mihono-chan. If you want to go play, you have to wait a little after you eat, alright?\r\nMihono: I know that much-!\r\nMai: What did you think, Sayaka-chan? How was the meat you cooked yourself?\r\nSayaka: It was tasty. But, I wasn't sure how much to grill it at first, so I burnt some.\r\nMai: I know what you mean. There were times I burned things when I first started cooking. I was worried I might undercook it.\r\nSayaka: You did it too, Mai? I want to try doing this again. With Kaoru next time.\r\nMai: It would be nice to come again when Kaoru is free.\r\nMai: Now that we've eaten, why don't we take a short break and then go to the river?\r\nMai: It seems like there's places where the river hardly flows at all, and you can just leisurely float along.\r\nSayaka: That sounds like Kaoru would like it.\r\nMai: That's true. If Kaoru-chan were here, I could see her relaxing with Nene-chan.\r\nSayaka: Tubing on the river. I was looking forward to it so much, after we finished talking last night, I couldn't fall asleep right away. I want to hurry and do it.\r\n\r\nMai: Kyaaaa!\r\nSayaka: Just then! The water was moving a little faster...!\r\nMai: Y-Yeah. There's a pretty big difference in speed at some points of the river, isn't there.\r\nSayaka: Sometimes it slows down, and sometimes it speeds up a little!\r\nMai: Mmhm... It's like a ride at an amusement park...!\r\nSayaka: It's really... fun!\r\nMai: When the water splashes you, it feels nice and cool.\r\nSayaka: Wahh-!?\r\nMai: Are you alright, Sayaka-chan!?\r\nSayaka: I'm fine. The swim ring just started sinking a little.\r\nMai: Ah... You scared me.\r\nMai: Oh, the tubing attendant is there. It looks like that's the end.\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nMai: Hey, Sayaka-chan? Do you want to go one more time? Tubing back down the river.\r\nSayaka: I was just thinking I wanted to go again.\r\nSayaka: Mai... You're amazing.\r\nMai: Fufu. But Sayaka-chan, that's because your face is saying you wanted to do it even more.\r\nMai: Besides, I had a lot of fun doing it too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Vh6dekDJVps\r\n[Stage Girl - Mai: Start]: Two Triangles\r\n\r\nKanami: I can't wait to spar with all these stage girls! If I pass this up, I'll never get another chance like it.\r\nKanami: Honestly, ever since we came here and I saw them fighting aradama, I've wanted to spar with them-.\r\nMai: You said the same thing back when you first saw Hiyori-chan at the tournament, didn't you, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: Ehehe.\r\nHiyori: You did? Though it sounds just like something you'd do.\r\nKanami: Ah, Hiyori-chan. What's up?\r\nHiyori: What do you mean, \"What's up?\" You're the one who said to meet here so we could spar now.\r\nKanami: Oh yeah! Then, let's get right to it! I'll catch up with you later, Mai-chan~.\r\nMai: Okay. Be sure not to get hurt, you two.\r\nMai: ......\r\nMahiru: Mai-chan?\r\nMai: Tsuyuzaki-san? Did you need something?\r\nMahiru: Nothing in particular, but, I was watching you with Kanami-chan. You seem close.\r\nMai: We sure are. As soon as we met in middle school, we were fast friends. We spend lots of time together, in classes and in the dorms.\r\nMahiru: Just like Karen-chan and I. Since the start of high school, we've always been together as roommates! Though now there's three of us, since Hikari-chan moved in.\r\nMahiru: What about Hiyori-chan? Her uniform is different, so she's from a different school, isn't she?\r\nMai: We got to know Hiyori-chan during an incident at the tournament in our second year, and we've been friends ever since.\r\nMai: It all started with Kanami-chan befriending Hiyori-chan.\r\nMahiru: So that's what happened.\r\nKanami: Mai-chaaan, Tsuyuzaki-saaan! There's some aradama, so come over here!\r\nMai: We should go.\r\nMahiru: Okay!\r\n\r\nAradama: GGGIIII!\r\nMai: Tsuyuzaki-san, one of the aradama went that way! Could you get it!\r\nAradama: GGIIIII!\r\nMahiru: It's a little... scary, but I'll do it!\r\nMahiru: EIIIIIII!!\r\nMahiru: There! Home run!\r\nMahiru: It looks like we just finished cleaning up the aradama too.\r\nMai: The aradama's really gone... You're incredible, Mahiru-san.\r\nMahiru: It sort of looked like a ball, so I just gave it a good whack on reflex.\r\nMai: That was only by reflex...?\r\nMai: And not just that, but how you casually twirled around that weapon of yours like a baton as you fought...\r\nMai: The way you moved... I think I could use it as reference in future fights.\r\nMahiru: It's sort of embarrassing hearing you talk like that, Mai-chan.\r\nMahiru: But, would it really be helpful learning from me?\r\nMai: I'd like to give it a try. Will you teach me how?\r\nMahiru: Mmm, but even if I teach you how to twirl a baton, it's not very useful for fighting, is it? I just somehow make it work...\r\nMahiru: I know! Mai-chan, could we try training like we're really fighting?\r\nMai: Of course, if that's alright with you.\r\nMahiru: Then, let's do it over there.\r\n\r\nMahiru: I love the shining stage, but I love seeing you shine even more. I want to dance with you forever, in a duet going round and round. 99th generation, Tsuyuzaki Mahiru.\r\nMai: That line just now had such a stylish ring to it.\r\nMahiru: Ehehe, thank you. It makes me happy, hearing you say that. I get the feeling we're sort of alike, Mai-chan.\r\nMai: We're alike?\r\nMahiru: But we can talk about that after!\r\nMahiru: Fighting might be more of your specialty, but come try me, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: Here I come!\r\nMahiru: Ah, but I would appreciate it if you'd go a little easy on me after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Stage Girl - Mai: End]: I Love Seeing You Shine Even More\r\n\r\nMahiru: Phew... I worked up a good sweat.\r\nMahiru: How was that? I hope it was helpful getting to see it up close at least.\r\nMai: It was. Though, I don't know if I'll be able to put it into practice straight away.\r\nMahiru: It would be difficult to use your okatana the same way I use my weapon, wouldn't it.\r\nMai: I think it's incredible enough that you can use that weapon like a baton, Tsuyuzaki-san!\r\nMahiru: You keep flattering me so much, Mai-chan~.\r\nMai: Ah, by the way. Before we started training, you told me the two of us were alike?\r\nMahiru: Yeah, about that. I sort of had the feeling that the relationship between you, Kanami-chan, and Hiyori-chan was similar to us.\r\nMahiru: I told you earlier, but, I'm roommates with Karen-chan, and I love her and we've always been together.\r\nMahiru: But then... When we were in our second year of high school, Hikari-chan, Karen-chan's childhood friend, transferred in.\r\nMai: Now that you say that, it does feel a little alike.\r\nMahiru: At the time... I felt like Hikari-chan was stealing Karen-chan away from me... I felt really anxious for a while...\r\nMahiru: That's why, I know I'm being a busybody, but I was kind of worried about how things are for you.\r\nMai: Thank you for your concern. Though, I'm fine. Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan are both close friends of mine.\r\nMahiru: I'm glad to hear it. Sorry, for asking you something so weird.\r\nMai: Not at all.\r\nMahiru: Ahh, even though I'm the older one here, I'm acting kind of presumptuous. You really feel more reliable, Mai-chan.\r\nMai: That's not true; I'm still working on that myself.\r\nMai: Since we came to this world, you've worried about the troubles we're having more times than I can remember.\r\nMai: You're like our reliable big sister.\r\nMahiru: Well, I am a big sister. I have a little sister and brother at home. Maybe it's because of them, but I always find myself wanting to help others.\r\nMai: Ah, I have two little sisters myself.\r\nMahiru: We're the same~.\r\nMahiru: I don't mind going out of my way to help people, or I guess I should say, I just feel like I need to do something.\r\nMahiru: I used to help even more with Karen-chan in the past. Like helping her get out of bed in the mornings.\r\nMai: I can't help myself from taking care of things for my friends either. Though, sometimes they say I'm being overprotective...\r\nMahiru: Hmmm, but, if the person you're helping isn't bothered by it, isn't it alright?\r\nMai: That's how I feel!\r\nKanami: Good work, you two-.\r\nKaren: Mahiru-chan, you sorta look like you're getting along with Mai-chan. What were you talking about?\r\nMahiru: About how we tend to look after others, and how we're a little bit a like.\r\nHiyori: Now that you mention it, you might be similar to each other.\r\nHikari: But when it comes to looking after others, I think you overdo it some.\r\nMahiru: If you could keep everything in order yourself, Hikari-chan, I wouldn't argue. Can you?\r\nHikari: Nn...\r\nKaren: I want you to help with that, Mahiru-chan. Without you around, our room would look like a disaster zone.\r\nMahiru: You and Hikari-chan should make sure to tidy up after yourselves, Karen-chan~.\r\nKanami: Hey, Mai-chan. I've got something I want to ask from you.\r\nMai: Like what? I'm all ears.\r\nKanami: I was eating the sweets Daiba-san made earlier. And I started wanting to have some of your cookies.\r\nKanami: When we get back, could you make some for me...?\r\nMai: Mm, I'll make you some.\r\nKanami: Nice-, thanks-!"}, {"paste_key": "zZVAX41r", "title": "Itomi Sayaka Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/zZVAX41r", "timestamp": "", "hits": "105", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOmY007u7kA\r\n\r\n1: Naptime\r\n\r\nKofuki: Oiii-!

Okay, I'll take north.\r\nSayaka: I'll go south.\r\nKofuki: And don't mess with my aradama!\r\n\r\nSayaka: Kofuki. One of mine is headed north.\r\nKofuki: Leave it to me. C'mon, aradama! I love you too!\r\nSayaka: Two more, headed north.\r\nKofuki: Eh? F-Fine, I'll take care of it...\r\nSayaka: Another one.\r\nKofuki: H-Hey, Sayaka.\r\nSayaka: ...You should be able to beat them, Kofuki. That's all that's left.\r\nSayaka: I don't really love aradama, so. If you want to fight them, I'll let you.\r\nKofuki: ...H-Heheh! Sounds like you're finally getting it! Hear that! I get you all to myself, aradama-chan!\r\n\r\nKofuki: Pant... Too bad. It's already over, huh.\r\nKofuki: Then, let's take a break. Take a seat, Sayaka.\r\nSayaka: ...Break? Were there too many aradama?\r\nKofuki: No such thing. I could've kept going if I hadn't killed them all. You got that, right?\r\n*Kofuki sits down*\r\nSayaka: Mm. I thought you could beat them, so I sent them to you.\r\n*Sayaka moves over to Kofuki*\r\nKofuki: Kuku, you catch on quick. But, aren't you tired too?\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nKofuki: After you sent them all to me, I started getting extra careful not to screw up my stance or utsushi.\r\n*Sayaka sits down*\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nKofuki: Ah, but it's not like I had to. I killed them all no sweat; not a scratch on me.\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nKofuki: ...Anyway, I didn't think you really weren't gonna do anything.\r\nSayaka: ...... *smiling*\r\nKofuki: You know, you're not all that bad.\r\nSayaka: ......\r\n*Sayaka slumps into Kofuki*\r\nKofuki: ...Wha, are you sleeping...? Hey! Don't fall asleep on me! Sayaka!\r\nSayaka: Nn......\r\nKofuki: D-Don't look so peaceful... Hey, Sayaka! Get off already-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Classmates\r\n\r\nNagasaki Sumi: Ehh! Ehhh!? Wh-Why're the aradama coming after me...!?\r\nSumi: No way! No way, no way! Someone, h-help!!\r\nSayaka: I'll deal with the aradama on the right. You handle the left.\r\nSumi: I-I-Itomi-san...! I can't! I was just supposed to be observing from the back today! I can't just start fighting like this!\r\nSayaka: ...Okay. If any come after you, just try to stop them. Stay in the back.\r\n\r\nSayaka: ...They're all taken care of.\r\nSumi: Ahh, finally. Sorry, and thank you.\r\nSumi: They said I'd just be observing, so I didn't expect real aradama to pop out at me like that. My hands are still shaking...\r\nSumi: ...You're amazing, Itomi-san. You're seriously strong.\r\nSayaka: ...\r\nSumi: I can't believe we're in the same year. The way you moved, I couldn't do that. It really takes something special to fight on the front lines, huh.\r\nSumi: I could never fight like that. Maybe I'm not cut out to be a toji...\r\nSayaka: ...Never? I think you just need to practice more.\r\nSumi: Ugh... M-Mm. Maybe. I really should practice some more.\r\nSayaka: You should commit to your attacks more too.\r\nSumi: Ugh... You have a point there, I think.\r\nSayaka: And you change stances too slowly.\r\nSumi: Mm... You're right.\r\nSayaka: And you're bad at keeping track of your surroundings.\r\nSumi: Right... I knew it, but, it seems like all I have are bad points.\r\nSumi: When I was chosen to be a member of the observation team, everyone just assumed I'd be strong because I'm so tall...\r\nSumi: But with me like I am, if they send me on a mission... I don't think I could even cut an aradama.\r\nSayaka: ...But you did cut one earlier.\r\nSumi: Earlier? Ahh, I just got carried away. Cutting it was... Just a fluke.\r\nSayaka: I didn't think you were too bad with a sword.\r\nSumi: Eh...?\r\nSayaka: Your swordsmanship was good. But, if you put more force into your swings, you'd do even better.\r\nSayaka: Then you need to change stances faster, and pay more attention to your surroundings.\r\nSayaka: Itomi-san...\r\nSayaka: I practiced a lot, until I was able to do more and more. So I think you should practice a lot too.\r\nSayaka: Do you want to practice together sometime?\r\nSumi: Eh, with me!?\r\nSayaka: Mm. Whenever I don't have a mission.\r\nSumi: Do you really think I can improve?\r\nSayaka: Mm. You're lacking in a lot of areas, but I think so.\r\nSumi: A... A lot, huh. But, thank you, Itomi-san. For encouraging me.\r\nSayaka: Eh...?\r\nSumi: I feel a bit better. I'm looking forward to training together.\r\nSayaka: ...O-Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3:\u3000Where These Feelings Reach\r\n\r\nTakatsu Yukina: ...Sayaka!\r\nSayaka: Ah... President Takatsu. I-\r\nYukina: So you're back. The mission this time involved a fairly large scale aradama, but you defeated it rather easily, didn't you?\r\nSayaka: Ah, yes... Nothing went wrong...\r\nYukina: Well done. Even Yukari-sama offered her praise. I'm very proud of you.\r\nSayaka: ...\r\nYukina: And the elite guard looked so ashamed. Fufu. You really did well today.\r\nYukina: Now, Sayaka. You must be tired, so rest.\r\nYukina: Ah... That's right. Take this.\r\nSayaka: Eh...? A box of... Candy...?\r\nYukina: Yes. It was delivered as a gift, but I have no interest in it. You should have them.\r\nSayaka: I-I...\r\nYukina: Go ahead. The sugar should help you recover as well.\r\nSayaka: ...Thank you, very much.\r\nSayaka: P-President, um... I'm very happy...\r\nYukina: Ahh, of course, you must be excited to sortie again. I wonder if I can't arrange something soon.\r\nYukina: With my Renpu students constantly proving their usefulness, it's only a matter of time before Yukari-sama realizes the incompetence of her elite guard.\r\nSayaka: ...\r\nYukina: The boorish Shidou Maki, that stuck up Konohana Suzuka, the impertinent Tsubakuro Yume, and--\r\nYukina: That utterly worthless Yomi. I feel ashamed whenever I'm reminded she graduated from Renpu.\r\nYukina: But don't worry, Sayaka. I won't allow you to turn out like that failure.\r\nSayaka: ...Right.\r\nYukina: You are the ultimate toji. The only one fit to guard Yukari-sama.\r\nYukina: And, for that purpose, I need you to abandon any pointless feelings or desires. You cannot allow them to interfere with your duties.\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nYukina: Now then, Sayaka, I'll speak to you later.\r\nSayaka: Abandon any... Pointless feelings.\r\nSayaka: They're pointless... After all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: What I Don't Want to Lose\r\n\r\nYukina: Sayaka... The greatest vessel I have ever found. Once I inject you with the noro in this ampoule, you will be complete.\r\nYukina: You will feel nothing, think of nothing... You'll simply remove all those who would oppose Yukari-sama.\r\nSayaka: (Nothing... What about Mai...?)\r\nSayaka: ......No!\r\nYukina: Sayaka!? Why are you resisting...!?\r\nSayaka: ...I always did what you said. But...\r\nSayaka: I can't... Be the toji you want me to be... No, I don't want to be.\r\nYukina: What are... What are you saying...? Sayaka?\r\nSayaka: I thought I didn't mind being empty... But, ever since I met Mai, there's this heat inside me.\r\nSayaka: I don't want to lose this feeling. I want to be with Mai, who was kind to me.\r\nYukina: ...Sayaka. You aren't a defective product like the elite guard. You are the successor to Myoho Muramasa.\r\nYukina: In place of... On my behalf, you exist to serve Yukari-sama! To be a tool for her!?\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan! It's alright now!\r\nSayaka: Mai... Why? Why did you come to save me...?\r\nMai: Because you're like a little sister to me! That's all the reason I need!\r\nSayaka: (...! It hurts... My chest hurts...)\r\nSayaka: (But... It feels so hot... Like my emptiness... Is being filled up... I... I don't...)\r\nYukina: Sayaka! That's enough selfishness!! Return to me now!!\r\nSayaka: (I don't want... To lose this feeling. So...)\r\nSayaka: Thank you... For taking care of me until now.\r\nSayaka: Mai... Let's go.\r\nYukina: Stop right there... Stop... W-Wait... Come back... Sayakaaaa!\r\n\r\nMai: ...Sayaka-chan. From now on, we can do whatever you want, you know? I'll always be with you.\r\nSayaka: ...I want, to eat... Your cookies, again.\r\nMai: ...! Okay! Of course!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Feelings of Wanting to Save\r\n\r\nWatanuki Kazumi: Then, the six of us from the Special Ritual Squad will be returning to headquarters.\r\nRiot Officer: Understood. Good work. We can handle cleaning things up here.\r\nKazumi: Thank you. Now, let's leave... Nn? Where are you going, Sayaka?\r\nSayaka: !! ...Yes, I was just...\r\nKazumi: Hurry and get in the car. We need to quickly deliver our report. The president is surely looking forward to it.\r\nSayaka: ...I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n--Much later\r\n\r\nSayaka: Pant, pant... It was right around here...!\r\nSayaka: ......There.\r\nCat: Meow...\r\nSayaka: Ah, um... It hurts... Doesn't it. Sorry. Because of what happened before...\r\nSayaka: I'll get someone... To take care of you... You won't die.\r\n\r\nHamatsuka Sakura: Hello, come in...\r\nSayaka: Please, I need medical care.\r\nSakura: Sayaka-chan? I hadn't heard you'd been injured...? Where are you hurt?\r\nSakura: ...Ah!\r\nSakura: A cat... Where'd you find her?\r\nSayaka: When I was on the suppression mission... The surrounding area was damaged--\r\nSayaka: I think, she was nearby and got hurt. W-When I went to see her later, she was in pain...\r\nSakura: I see... You're right... She's not doing well.\r\nSayaka: I didn't know where to go, so, I came here.\r\nSakura: I understand, Sayka-chan. I've never worked on a cat before... But I'll do everything I can...!\r\nSakura: First, I need to clean the wound... Sorry, kitty. Just bear with it a little.\r\nSayaka: Um...\r\nSakura: Hm?\r\nSayaka: I might have... Been the one that hurt her. I blocked everything out while I was fighting, and when it was over, I found her.\r\nSakura: Working as a toji is a matter of life and death, after all...\r\nSayaka: ...Will she die?\r\nSakura: Eh?\r\nSayaka: Because of the injury. Is she going... To die...\r\nSakura: Sayaka-chan... Don't say that.\r\nSayaka: Please save her. Please.\r\nSakura: I know you're worried. But, it's okay. I don't think the wound is that deep.\r\nSakura: The cut was really messy, so I was a little shocked... But see, it's looking better now.\r\nSakura: See, kitty? You're safe now.\r\nCat: Meow\r\nSakura: Ahh, she must be hungry too. She'll be doing better after she gets something to eat.\r\nSayaka: What do cats eat...?\r\nSakura: ...Cat food, I think?\r\nSayaka: Where... Can I buy that?\r\nSakura: Probably everywhere? At convenience stores, at least.\r\nSayaka: I'll buy some...!\r\nSakura: Fufu. Aren't you lucky, kitty. A kind person saved you... Do you think you'll get better soon?\r\nCat: Meow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/A8mB5sp3tpA\r\n[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start]: Lacking the Words\r\n\r\nToji A: What now... Yanase-san, Itomi-san! Many more aradama are coming this way...!\r\nMai: It might be frightening, but no matter how many there are, what we need to do hasn't changed.\r\nMai: Everyone finished evacuating, so let's hold our formation and take them out.\r\nSayaka: It's okay. I can... Deal with them.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan!?\r\nAradama: GGIII...!\r\nSayaka: --HAA!\r\nAradama: KSHAAA--!\r\nSayaka: Kh...\r\nSayaka: (I want to be strong enough to defeat them on my own.

She stopped all those aradama by herself...\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan...\r\nSayaka: Mai.\r\nMai: Why did you run off and break formation?\r\nSayaka: ...? ...I made sure to kill all the aradama.\r\nMai: That's true. You did defeat the aradama. Still, you might be strong, Sayaka-chan, but you're not supposed to fight on your own.\r\nMai: And you were even hurt a little.\r\nSayaka: I thought this would be the fastest...\r\nSayaka: You have to exorcise rampaging aradama as fast as you can.\r\nMai: Mmm... That's not what I mean though.\r\nSayaka: Then what...? Mai, I don't... understand.\r\nMai: Ah, stop, Sayaka-chan!\r\nMai: ...Sayaka-chan.\r\n\r\n--The next day.\r\n\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nSayaka: (...I want to talk to Mai. But... If what happened yesterday happens... I don't want that.)\r\nSayaka: (What should I do...)\r\n\r\nKaoru: Oh, there you are, Sayaka. So, what happened?\r\nSayaka: ...Kaoru, there's something I need your help with.\r\n\r\nKaoru: So you got told off by Mai during a mission yesterday, then you ran away, and now it's hard to talk to her like usual?\r\nSayaka: With things like this... I don't know what I'm supposed to do.\r\nKaoru: I know you want to make up with her. But, why did you do something reckless like fighting the aradama by yourself?\r\nSayaka: Because I want to be stronger. So nobody has to go through anything painful.\r\nKaoru: Well, Mai said she's worried about you too.\r\nSayaka: Mai did...?\r\nSayaka: She isn't... Mad at me?\r\nKaoru: I mean, of course she's mad when you put yourself in danger. But it's not like she's mad because she hates you now.\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nSayaka: Kaoru... I want to be with Mai like I used to.\r\nKaoru: If you think you did something wrong, then tell her you're sorry. After that, tell her how you feel. Then you'll make up.\r\nSayaka: Thank you.

Then--\r\n\r\nMai: Good work, Sayaka-chan. ...Why don't we go back to the dorms?\r\nSayaka: Before that... There's something I have to tell you...\r\nSayaka: I'm sorry, Mai... I didn't listen to what you told me yesterday... And I made you worry today...\r\nMai: No, I should apologize too.\r\nMai: To tell the truth, Kaoru-chan told me about how she spoke with you. But still... I couldn't make up with you right away...\r\nSayaka: No, that was my fault.\r\nSayaka: I never had any friends before, so I didn't know how to make up after we fought.\r\nMai: But I also should have explained sooner why I was warning you yesterday. Then there wouldn't have been this misunderstanding.\r\nSayaka: Mai. I... I want to get even stronger. So, what happened yesterday... I might do it again.\r\nMai: In that case, we should get stronger together.\r\nSayaka: But, I want to get stronger so I can protect all of you. You're going to get stronger with me, Mai?\r\nMai: That's right. I feel like getting stronger too, so I can protect you and everyone else.\r\nMai: Because you're a very important friend to me.\r\nSayaka: I... I feel the same way.

When you go to a pool, you've gotta try the lazy river pool, right?\r\nSayaka: Lazy river pool?\r\nKaoru: You get to float down a river on a pool tube, and then you fall asleep. Just picturing it, it's the best...\r\nSayaka: ...Is that, fun?\r\nKaoru: 'Course it's fun.\r\nKaoru: Just floating around in the pool is fun on its own.\r\nSayaka: Just floating around in the pool...\r\nEllen: Don't listen to her!

They said they were experiencing trouble, and made a polite appeal, or rather, a request to us.\r\nKofuki: Ooh, there's more aradama-chan here!? Well aren't we lucky! \r\nMirja: No, it isn't that kind of trouble. They requested a stuntman for their film.\r\nKofuki: Huh?\r\nSayaka: ...Stuntman?\r\nMirja: That's right.\r\nAssistant Director: Ah, it's a good thing you toji girls are here. A strange rumor started up that aradama show up in our studio, and it's been giving us problems... Serious problems.\r\nAssistant Director: They say there's a high chance of people getting hurt doing stunts here if any aradama come out. Stuntmen are turning us down... All of them, in fact.\r\nKofuki: That doesn't mean it's something you ask us to do though. I'm not doing it either.\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki, I understand your complaint. However, this is an issue that could be considered secondary damages caused by aradama.\r\nKofuki: Secondary damages?\r\nMirja: Secondary damages can happen in a variety of ways. This would be considered a case of harmful misinformation.\r\nMirja: Aradama are not commonly appearing here at the moment, but because that has happened in the past, as the director says, unfortunate rumors begin to arise.\r\nMirja: We won't be capable of supporting them for years to come, but, whenever possible, it should be our policy to assist them.\r\nKofuki: Damnit... Making me do the annoying jobs.\r\nSayaka: Mai told me about it. We have to boost the image of toji.\r\nMirja: In simpler terms, that's exactly right.\r\nAssistant Director: With that cleared up, we'd like to ask you to be our stuntman... Considering your physique, would you be able to do it?\r\nSayaka: You want me to do it?\r\nSayaka: I can't do anything like acting...\r\nAssistant Director: You won't need to say any lines. \r\nAssistant Director: What we want is for you to film you leaping around and jumping off rooftops. It seems like the director had seen toji fighting aradama before, and came up with the idea for this request.\r\nAssistant Director: We can't afford to delay shooting any longer, and with our lack of time, budget, and suspicious circumstances, we can't arrange to find new stuntmen, so please! \r\nSayaka: ...What should I do? Kofuki, Mirja...\r\nKofuki: Do whatever you want. If you don't want to, then say no.\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nSayaka: If there's something I can do to help... I want to do it. I don't know if I can do it right though...\r\nAssistant Director: Thank you! Really, thank you so much!\r\nAssistant Director: Here, the director and film crew are waiting over this way. We can go over the details with them.\r\n\r\nKofuki: Who'd have thought she'd end up being in a movie, huh-. Even Sayaka must be pretty shocked right about now.\r\nMirja: I'd imagine so. Though, I was somewhat surprised that Itomi Sayaka decided on it herself.\r\nKofuki: Well, yeah.\r\nMirja: And also, you have a fairly caring side yourself, to stay to look after her when we aren't even sure of when the filming will end.\r\nKofuki: That's just cause, if I went back, it's not like there's anything to do there either. \r\nMirja: I see. At any rate, the filming should be beginning shortly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Shinsengumi - Sayaka: End]: A True to Life Take\r\n\r\nFilm Director: ...Action, start!\r\nSoldier Actor: This is the Shinsengumi; we'll be taking you outlaw ronin in!

Everybody split up!\r\nSayaka: (When that person runs, chase him.)\r\nSayaka: (Come around right in front of him, and point the tip of my sword toward him... Then done.)\r\nRonin B: Eee!?\r\nKofuki: She's actually not doing that bad.\r\nMirja: It should be no difficulty at all for her to jump about and wield an imitation sword like that.\r\nFilm Director: CUUUUUUUT!\r\n\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nKofuki: Yo, nice going. What was it like? Giving that a try.\r\nSayaka: I only... did the things they told me to do.\r\nSayaka: It's different, from fighting against aradama or in a sparring match... It felt a little strange.\r\nMirja: Even so, you performed it expertly. That haori fit you well too.\r\nSayaka: I couldn't tell for myself, but that's good.\r\nMirja: That director and assistant director made it clear they were very grateful, so it seems they thought it was a great performance.\r\nMirja: They said they were highly impressed you were able to do those movements without the help of wires.\r\nKofuki: And that they might come asking for your help again.\r\nSayaka: ...I won't do this again. I was a little nervous after all.\r\nKofuki: That's just cause nothing beats going up against aradama-chan.\r\nSayaka: That reminds me, they said they would send us movie tickets.\r\nMirja: All we can do now is pray the filming is finished without incident, so the film can be opened to the public.\r\nSayaka: Mm. If this can help boost the image of toji... I'll be glad.\r\nMirja: I'm sure you won't have to worry about that, Itomi Sayaka.\r\nKofuki: There's nothing left to do here, so lets go home already."}, {"paste_key": "Zr9n1Pdg", "title": "Mashiko Kaoru Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/Zr9n1Pdg", "timestamp": "", "hits": "84", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqEd_v9cVH4\r\nhttps://youtu.be/qSMb2Ua4TwY\r\nhttps://youtu.be/A4RipDwmT9Y\r\nhttps://youtu.be/U_8Z9M9PWSk\r\nhttps://youtu.be/SB5mF34N1ZY\r\n\r\n1: The Heart of a Mashiko\r\n\r\n3 years ago--\r\n\r\nClassmate: Wait, on the next mission, we're with Mashiko-san?\r\nClassmate: I don't want to be in the same group as her!\r\nKaoru: ...\r\nTeacher: Don't talk like that. All of you need to be able to work together.\r\nClassmate: But Mashiko-san helps aradama, doesn't she? That's what my father said! The Mashiko family is all like that.\r\nClassmate: There's no way we can fight alongside someone like her! What if she gets us hurt!\r\nNene: Ne~...\r\nClassmate: See, she always has that weird aradama with her too. Who knows when it might try attacking us...\r\nKaoru: Nene would never hurt anybody!\r\nKaoru: And I'm the one who doesn't want to work with toji like you! You only think of yourselves!\r\nTeacher: M-Mashiko-san! Where are you going!?\r\n\r\nKaoru: ......\r\nNene: Ne...\r\nKaoru: Forget about them, Nene. They're all wrong. Even though they don't know anything about you, they...\r\nKaoru: ...People like that, they just listen to what they're told and don't think about anything else...\r\nKaoru: ...But I can't stop myself from getting mad about it.\r\nNene: ! Ne-!\r\nKaoru: Nn? What's wrong?\r\nKaoru: ...! An aradama!?\r\nAradama: GRUUUU...!!\r\nNene: Ne~~~~~!!\r\nKaoru: ...It's almost like two cats having a turf war.\r\nKaoru: --But now's not the time to relax. Nene, let's go.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\n\r\nKaoru: See, you're not so tough. Let that be a lesson for you. Don't ever come back around here.\r\nKaoru: If you get caught here again, you're gonna get killed for real.\r\nAradama: ......\r\nKaoru: ...And it's gone.\r\nNene: Ne-?\r\nKaoru: ...It was just guarding its home. There's no reason to kill it.\r\nKaoru: No matter what people say, that's how the Mashiko- That's how I do things.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nKaoru: ...Ughh. If they find out I let another one go, everyone's going to get upset again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Infamous Slacker\r\n\r\nNishi Kozue: Sigh... I'm used to getting dragged in to help out on operator duty by now, but...\r\nKozue: The one in charge of dealing with this aradama is Mashiko Kaoru-san...\r\nKozue: \"Anyway, I don't feel like it.\" \"I just wanna go home.\" \"I'll pass on this mission.\"\r\nKozue: Her reputation for her attitude really precedes her.\r\nKozue: All other available toji are busy with other missions, so I'll just have to rely on her... I just have to get her feeling motivated.\r\nKozue: Alright! Time to check on her progress!\r\nKaoru: Hello.\r\nKozue: Thank you for your work! So, how's the mission going?\r\nKaoru: You too. It's going smoothly so far. I'll stay on alert for the time being.\r\nKozue: When we received the request for this guarding and patrol mission, I know you just happened to be in the area. So thank you for quickly responding, Mashiko-san.\r\nKozue: There are plans for another unit to join up with you in just a few days. I'm sorry, but, in the meantime, could you...\r\nKaoru: Nah, I can handle this myself. There's been lots of reports of sighting the aradama, but it hasn't actually caused any damage yet.\r\nKaoru: In fact, having more toji in the area might provoke it. It's probably best to keep this small scale.\r\nKozue: ...!?\r\nKozue: I see... You might be right.\r\nKozue: It's just, with only you stationed there, you could be on assignment for quite some time...\r\nKaoru: I'm prepared for that. You don't have to worry about me. I'll just keep up a steady search.\r\nKaoru: I'm the one who accepted responsibility for this in the first place, after all. I have to see it through to the end.\r\nKozue: ...Understood! Good luck in your search!\r\nKozue: ...She's nothing like I heard... Mashiko-san is such a determined toji!\r\nKozue: She makes good judgment calls, and has a strong sense of responsibility...\r\nKozue: She didn't even complain once about being assigned such a basic mission. I have a newfound respect for her~.\r\nKozue: Alright, I have to do my best assisting her. I can't overlook any bit of information that might help!\r\n\r\nKaoru: Ahh~... What a pain. That's enough for today.\r\nNene: Ne~!\r\n???: Man, you're so cool, Kaoru-chan! I couldn't feel safer with a toji like you around!\r\nKaoru: Heh, keeping the town safe's a small price to pay for getting to eat the super famous \"Mare Sushi\"'s sushi free of charge.\r\nKaoru: Ah, I'll have some kanpyo rolls, thanks.\r\nSushi Shop's Boss: You got it! Hey, Kaoru-chan, you should hang out here forever.\r\nKaoru: I don't know~. I'm a pretty busy girl~.\r\nSushi Shop's Boss: Well we can figure something out! We'd do anything for you toji! Here, your kanpyo rolls are ready!\r\nKaoru: If you insist~. I guess I'll think about it. (chew chew)...\r\nKaoru: Mmm~~~! So good. Boss, your sushi's the best. Next up, make it crab, salmon roe, and urchin.\r\nNene: Nenene~!\r\nKaoru: Throw in some engawa too.\r\nSushi Shop's Boss: Coming right up!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Nene's Secret\r\n\r\nNene: Nene-!\r\nMirja: Despite there being an aradama right here, the spectrum finder shows no reaction... What a mysterious creature.\r\nEllen: Nene isn't dangerous, after all. It's right not to react to him.\r\nKaoru: Nene's my pet before he's an aradama.\r\nMihono: I don't really get it, but if he's safe to be around then I don't mind.\r\nKiyoka: He doesn't seem scary either, actually, kind of cute... Um, is it okay if I pet him?\r\nNene: (dodge)\r\nKiyoka: H-Huh?\r\nMihono: Kiyoka-chan, you have to approach animals gently so they understand you aren't trying to hurt them~. Get close slowly, so they don't get scared, and...\r\nNene: (dodge)\r\nMihono: H-Huh? He keeps running off... Is Nene afraid of strangers?\r\nEllen: No, actually, the thing about Nene... He loves big busts most of all~.\r\nKiyoka: Ehh!? S-So that means, we...\r\nMihono: Th-That's rude! All of a sudden you're not so cute anymore!\r\nKaoru: Nene can see the future when it comes to chest sizes too. Hate to break it to you.\r\nMihono: Ughh... So, someone like Chii-nee's more Nene's type...?\r\nNene: Ne~!\r\nMirja: Wha!? M-Me too!?\r\nMihono: Huh, now that I look closer... Mirja-san's got it going on too...\r\nMirja: P-Please don't make strange observations like that...!\r\nNene: Ne~! Ne~!\r\nKofuki: Yo, aradama-chan. How's it going. Come play with me too.\r\nNene: Ne-Ne-!? \r\n*Nene hides behind Mihono*\r\nMihono: H-Hey, Kofuki-san!? Put your okatana away!\r\nKofuki: What for? That's an aradama, you know?\r\nMihono: Yeah, but, uhh... Look how cute he is! And see, you're scaring him!\r\nKofuki: Huh? What are you talking about? Every single aradama-chan's cute!\r\nKofuki: Get it? Don't go thinking you're some special kind of cute, okay?\r\nNene: N-Nene~...\r\nKaoru: Oi. Go ahead and try it. See if you can get through me first.\r\nKofuki: ...\r\nKaoru: ...\r\nMihono: The laid back Kaoru-san's... Acting super scary...!\r\nKofuki: ...Heh, it was just a joke. As much as I love aradama-chan, a chihuahua like that's not gonna be any fun.\r\nKofuki: ...But when I haven't seen any in a while, and I start getting bored, who knows.\r\nKaoru: Nene. Never under any circumstances be alone with her.\r\nNene: Ne~~~...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Highlights from the Tournament Selection Quarterfinals\r\n\r\nAnnouncer: In a moment, the first match of the quarterfinals will begin. Mashiko Kaoru, Maruyama Akane, step forward!\r\nKaoru: ......\r\nKaoru: (...This is so annoying. It's sad how long I've had to keep doing this...)\r\nKaoru: (I carelessly got in a few wins, and now if I win here, who knows how long it'll be before they let me go...)\r\nKaoru: (...Okay. This time I'm gonna lose for sure. Any toji who made it to the quarterfinals should be able to dodge if I do big slow\u3000swings.)\r\nReferee: Bow!\r\nKaoru: (And, if I do it right, there's no way she'll ignore such a huge opening. Alright... With this plan, I'll shoot for a speedy defeat!)\r\nReferee: Begin!\r\nKaoru: Kieee.\r\n(WHAM!!)\r\nKaoru: ......Huh?\r\nAkane: Gh...! Such a heavy hit! The muscles in my arms and legs are tingling-!\r\nKaoru: Oi... Why'd you go and block that? Take one look at Nenekirimaru and you should get how strong it is...!\r\nAkane: That's why I wanna take it head on! Kaoru-senpai! I've been waiting for this fight!\r\nAkane: Senpai's full strength... Don't hold anything back! Give it all you got!!\r\nAkane: Come on and show me---!!!\r\nKaoru: A-Are you for real!?\r\nAkane: We'll do it fair and square! Blocking every hit! Feeling the results of all each other's training!\r\nKaoru: (This is the worst... She's a total meat for brains. The natural enemy to my big instant defeat operation...!)\r\nKaoru: (If we keep exchanging hits like this, I'm going to start feeling it too...)\r\nKaoru: (And this hot-bloodedness... No mistaking it, she's a real stamina monster... This match could really drag on...)\r\nAkane: Was that enough warmup for you? The real deal starts here-!\r\nKaoru: (...Hell no! I have to do something to get out of this situation...!)\r\nKaoru: KIEEEEE!\r\nAkane: Gwahh-!\r\nReferee: That's enough!\r\nKaoru: Ah.\r\nReferee: Winner, Mashiko Kaoru! You will advance to the semi-finals!\r\nAkane: Dammit, you got me good-!\r\nAkane: But that was an awesome match! Thanks a lot, Kaoru-senpai!\r\nAkane: I'll be rooting for you in the semifinals, and the finals too! So you better win!!\r\nKaoru: ......Th-This can't be happening......\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: They're a Great Pair\r\n\r\nEllen: The target aradama both ran in different directions!\r\nEllen: Kaoru, let's split up! You take the one that went that way!\r\nKaoru: Well, I guess we've got no choice... I'm on it~.\r\nEllen: I'm counting on you! I'll see you later!\r\n\r\nKaoru: That's how it was supposed to go, but...\r\nKaoru: Pant, pant... This one, it's way too fast...\r\nKaoru: At least it's stuck in this alley, since it doesn't seem populated, but why does it keep on getting narrower...?\r\nKaoru: Damnit... If I go any further than this, fighting with Nenekirimaru is gonna get annoying...\r\nKaoru: Whatever. It's sink or swim, I guess...\r\nKaoru: Kieeee!\r\nKaoru: Ah.\r\nKaoru: ......I didn't see that sign up there... No good. Nenekirimaru's totally stuck.\r\nKaoru: Nnghh~~~\r\nKaoru: Nnnngh~~~~~\r\nKaoru: ......\r\nEllen: Kaoru-! I took care of the aradama on my end~! What about yours...\r\nEllen: ......Kaoru~? Why're you swinging around on Nenemirimaru? Some new game you invented?\r\nKaoru: If it is, it's no fun. I can't get it loose. Help me~.\r\nEllen: Oh! That's bad! Wait a second, I'll help!\r\nEllen: I'm going to start pulling, okay~? Heave, ho~!\r\nKaoru: Owowowww! You're gonna rip me in half!\r\nEllen: I got it free~! Kaoru, welcome back~!\r\nKaoru: Ahh, okay, okay. I can't breathe, so quit hugging me already.\r\nKaoru: That was dangerous. Please try not getting your okatana stuck while I'm away, okay~?\r\nEllen: So? Is that mission complete?\r\nKaoru: Nah, it got away. But I've got it cornered in this dead end alleyway. Just, like you saw, it's way too small for Nenekirimaru.\r\nEllen: So you want me to go in and finish it off for you, right?\r\nKaoru: Something like that. Alright, go, Ellen!\r\nEllen: Hey, don't treat me like I'm your pet-!\r\nKaoru: ...She says that, but she charged right in.\r\nKaoru: Phew-. It's always a good time pairing up with Ellen.\r\nKaoru: She's talented enough to handle anything. And she never makes me work harder than I have to.\r\nEllen: Hey-! Kaoru~!\r\nKaoru: Oh, what's up-? You finished already-?\r\nEllen: The aradama's headed your way! Give it a big finishing blow for me-!\r\nKaoru: H-Huh!?\r\nEllen: Go, Kaoru~!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/qSMb2Ua4TwY\r\n[Yukata - Kaoru: Start]: Let's Test Our Courage!\r\n\r\nEllen: Alright then, let's get this test of courage underway! We made lots to draw, so everyone take turns drawing them and pair up!\r\nYui: Guhehehe, I can't wait to go.\r\nKiyoka: I just hope I'm together with Kofuki-san... Ah, mine's number 3.\r\nKofuki: It's not like it matters who you end up with. Uhh, number 5.\r\nYui: Fufufu, Kiyoka-chan, mine's number 3.\r\nKiyoka: Eeeek...!\r\nKaoru: You guys sure are getting excited before we've even started-.\r\nKaoru: I was wondering why you called us out here this late, but why're we doing a test of courage all of a sudden?\r\nEllen: On summer nights, you've got to do a test of courage!\r\nKaoru: No way; that's when you sit in an air conditioned room sipping juice watching night games of baseball.\r\nEllen: Don't be like that, Kaoru! Draw a lot!\r\nKaoru: Fine then... Nn, number 1.\r\nMihono: Ah, I'm number 1, Kaoru-san!\r\nKaoru: Guess we're together, Mihono.\r\nEllen: Is everyone paired up? Now then, number 1, start us off!\r\n\r\nMihono: Hmhmhmm~.\r\nKaoru: It's supposed to be a test of courage, so what're you humming for? Aren't you scared?\r\nMihono: I come out in the mountains at night for missions and training and stuff, so there's no way it'd be scary.\r\nKaoru: (When she says it all matter of factly like that, it makes me want to scare her...)\r\nKaoru: (...Alright.)\r\nKaoru: Then, since this is a test of courage and all, how about we tell ghost stories while we walk?\r\nMihono: Ghost stories?\r\nMihono: I'm fine with that, but... There's not really any ghost stories I know off the top of my head.\r\nKaoru: Don't worry about it. I've got the best ghost story to tell.\r\nMihono: Huh, you do!? What's it about?\r\nKaoru: (Kukuku, Mihono. You won't be making that face for long!)\r\nKaoru: Actually, this one's about where we're walking right now.\r\nMihono: Okay.\r\nKaoru: This place used to be a graveyard.\r\nMihono: ......Eh?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Yukata - Kaoru: End]: Tell Me You're Lying\r\n\r\nMihono: ...No way, there's no way there's a graveyard this far in the mountains. You just came up with that now, right?\r\nKaoru: You'd think so, wouldn't you?\r\nKaoru: But, this is a true story. If you think I'm lying, you can check with Ellen.\r\nMihono: You say that, but...\r\nKaoru: (Maybe if I give one more push she'll buy it? What's something good... Oh.)\r\nKaoru: See, look over there. There's a Jizo statue, right?\t\t[Jizo is a deity that is a savior of souls and also a protector of travelers. Statues are often found in graveyards, but also along roadsides.]\r\nKaoru: That's a leftover from when this place was a graveyard.\r\nMihono: It's true... Then, this place really is...\r\nMihono: Eep!?\r\nKaoru: (Though, I'm making all of it up.)\r\nKaoru: There's a lot of paved roads up this mountain, see? Those are trails they made way back to let people pay a visits to the graveyard here.\r\nMihono: Th-That makes sense...\r\nKaoru: But, y'know, mountains come with a lot of trouble. Like... landslides and stuff.\r\nMihono: Th-Then...\r\nKaoru: Yeah. That's why they decided to move away from this graveyard. There was this really bad landslide... And, apparently, they couldn't even check on all the graves.\r\nMihono: ...[gulp].\r\nKaoru: ...Which means, some might've been left buried. Just under your feet right now, there could be a dead body.\r\nMihono/Ellen: GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nKaoru: Uwah!? What're you doing here, Ellen!!\r\nEllen: I made a mistake! I was planning on scaring you two, but I ended up screaming by accident!\r\nEllen: Anyway, Kaoru! Because of you, I can't stay here anymore!\r\nEllen: So, let me go with you!\r\nKaoru: Guess I have to.\r\n\r\nMihono: By the way, Ellen-san.\r\nEllen: What is it?\r\nMihono: When we left, you were there to see us off, weren't you? So how'd you get around ahead of us?\r\nMihono: W-Wait, Ellen-san...? She's gone...?\r\nKaoru: ...Maybe it was just a ghost borrowing the form of Ellen.\r\nMihono: UWAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!! We're going back! We're going back right now, Kaoru-san!!\r\nKaoru: Quit yanking my arm! That hurts! I was just kidding; I was kidding about everything!\r\nMihono: ...Huh? You were kidding?\r\nKaoru: Everything I said I made up! Ellen probably just used jin'i too.\r\nMihono: You were... That's going way too far for a prank! When we get back, I'm complaining to Ellen-san!\r\n\r\nEllen: Welcome back! How did the test of courage go?\r\nMihono: Don't ask me! That was really mean, scaring us like that, Ellen-san!\r\nEllen: ...? What are you talking about? I was...\r\nEllen: Right here the whole time, you know...?\r\nKaoru: Then, the Ellen back there was...\r\nKaoru/Mihono: HIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/A4RipDwmT9Y\r\n[Misogi - Kaoru: Start]: A Little About the Past\r\n\r\nKaoru: Today's kinda hot, isn't it-... My water bottle's already run dry...\r\nNene: Ne~~...\r\nEllen: I only have a little bit left in mine, but, want to drink it, Kaoru?\r\nKaoru: Gladly. Or at least, I'd want to, but, if you ran out of yours, that'd be bad too.\r\nEllen: Should we make a trip back to town then? We'd be losing a lot of time though.\r\nChie: Ellen-san, Kaoru-san. It's alright. I brought lots of drinks with me.\r\nEllen: Chie, thank you so much!\r\nKaoru: It's nice somebody came prepared. You really saved us. [gulp gulp]... Phwah. Can't thank you enough.\r\nChie: It's just a part of me acting as everyone's onee-san.\r\nEllen: Have you been an onee-san ever since you were a little girl, Chie?\r\nChie: When I was little, I spent most of my time together with Mihono-chan, so it's true that back then I wanted to try hard to act as an onee-san.\r\nChie: Though I'm not sure it went too well at first.\r\nKaoru: Well, there's no way you could've been the same as a kid. But we all depend on you the way you are now.\r\nEllen: That's right; Chie's our reliable onee-san.\r\nEllen: By the way, I've never really asked you about it before, Kaoru, but, what were you like as a little girl?\r\nChie: Ah, I'd like to hear about that too.\r\nKaoru: Give me a break...\r\nEllen: Don't be like that. Do it for meee.\r\nNene: Nenenene~. Ne~ne.\r\nChie: Nene-chan's asking for it too, see?\r\nKaoru: Kh... Letting her hold you like that; you're totally on her side now...\r\nKaoru: I'll tell you about it, but it's not all that interesting, okay?\r\nEllen: I don't believe that for a minute, Kaoru! I have a feeling this'll be very interesting!\r\nKaoru: Anyway, when I was little, I was a real brat. I used to play with kids around the neighborhood, and I sorta ended up in the position of leading them around.\r\nChie: That's a little unexpected.\r\nKaoru: It just sort of happened after I'd stand up for the ones who got left out or got messed with.\r\nKaoru: Maybe it's cause I was hooked on the heroes you'd see in tokusatsu shows-.\r\nNene: Nene!\r\nEllen: You still like tokusatsu heroes now too, don't you, Kaoru-. Did aim towards becoming a toji ever since back then?\r\nKaoru: I guess-. I know you know, but the Mashikos are a toji family, so my mom and grandma were both toji too. I respected it because of that, or maybe looked up to it.\r\nKaoru: Becoming a toji meant you got to defeat aradama, after all.\r\nEllen: What else were you like?\r\nKaoru: What else-; when I was a kid, I played with my grandpa a lot too. I always felt at ease being around him.\r\nEllen: Since I love my grandpa too, that makes us the same~.\r\nChie: I'd imagine you always got along with Nene-chan too, right?\r\nNene: Ne!\r\nKaoru: About Nene...\r\nEllen: Before we can talk about that, it looks like we've got work to do. There's a reading on the spectrum finder.\r\nKaoru: Guess we'd better hurry-.\r\nNene: Nene~!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Misogi - Kaoru: End]: Together With Nene\r\n\r\nEllen: Kaoru!

I don't want him to get hurt anymore.\r\nKaoru: All the more because, in the past, I hurt Nene once...\r\nChie: Eh...?\r\nEllen: Something like that happened between you and Nene...?\r\nKaoru: I told you before, I looked up to toji. But, there was also a time I didn't want to be a Mashiko toji.\r\nKaoru: I'm not proud of it, but that was my rebellious phase.\r\nKaoru: ...I didn't want to work as a toji who killed aradama, so I hated it.\r\nKaoru: But, since I was a girl from the Mashiko family... There's no way I could just not be one. It's not like I could go against Grandma and everybody.\r\nKaoru: ...So I got way too fed up with it and started lashing out.\r\nKaoru: ...Seeing me taking my anger out on stuff, Nene came and tried to calm me down... I hit him by mistake.\r\nKaoru: And... really hard, too...\r\nChie: That's...\r\nEllen: Kaoru...\r\nNene: ......\r\nKaoru: If people won't get hurt, wouldn't it be fine to let aradama be around?\r\nKaoru: I want to make the world a place where nobody hates aradama, including this guy here.\r\nEllen: I see. I completely agree with that viewpoint of yours, Kaoru!\r\nChie: A world where neither aradama or people hurt each other... I'd like that to be a reality someday.\r\nEllen: And, as a symbol of that, when the time comes, let's make an Aradama Park!\r\nChie: Eh?\r\nKaoru: Kuku... Now there's an idea. We can quit being toji and kick back and relax at Aradama Park.\r\nChie: I smell trouble brewing...\r\nNene: ...Ne?\r\nKaoru: Oh, you're up? You overslept a little, but I'll forgive you this once.\r\nNene: Nee??\r\nKaoru: You're gonna be the park's main attraction, after all.

Get a beef bowl in front of the station and head home?\r\nKaoru: I'm not... gonna take that!\r\nKiyoka: S-So assertive...!\r\nEllen: What you're saying makes some sense, Kaoru.\r\nEllen: So basically, you think we should stay the night here?\r\nKaoru: Exactly. It's fine every once in a while, right?\r\nKiyoka: I do feel like I'd rather rest a little here than hurry back.\r\nKaoru: Right? Even toji need a break.\r\nEllen: If that's what we've decided on, then leave the hotel reservations to me-! I'll call a friend of mine-!\r\nKiyoka: A friend who will reserve us a hotel room...?\r\nKaoru: She's got a lot of weird friends, so don't think too hard about it.\r\n\r\nKaoru: I'm all filled up~.\r\nEllen: You sound like an old man, Kaoru.\r\nKiyoka: But, it really was delicious. You'll have to thank your friend for me, Ellen-san, for telling us about this restaurant!\r\nEllen: I'll be sure to let them know-! Now then, about the hotel... It's this way.\r\nKiyoka: What kind of hotel is it?\r\nKaoru: It's probably some little place tucked away-.\r\nKiyoka: That's what the place we ate at was like, wasn't it.\r\nEllen: Ah, I can see it. It's that hotel there-!\r\nKaoru: Which one... Eh?\r\nKiyoka: Umm, you mean... that high class looking hotel?\r\nEllen: Yes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pajama - Kaoru: End]: Pajama Party!\r\n\r\nEllen: Tah-dah-! We all have matching pajamas!\r\nKiyoka: These pajamas are cute! Though...\r\nKiyoka: (Since we're wearing the same pajamas, the difference in chest size is...)\r\nKaoru: (That face says she's getting overwhelmed by the difference in Ellen's assets.)\r\nKiyoka: No, that's not it. Those are just pectoral muscles... Those are just pectoral muscles...)\r\nKaoru: (Kiyoka, this'll go a lot easier if you just don't think about it...)\r\nEllen: What about pectoral muscles?\r\nKaoru: She's probably wondering how to train 'em, right?\r\nEllen: If you want to train up your pecs, I think it'd be good to ask Makimaki about it.\r\nKiyoka: ...That's true; Shidou-san's like that too...\r\nKaoru: Anyway, how about we get to sleep.\r\nEllen: Since we're having a pajama party, we have to do a pillow fight and talk about love interests!\r\nKaoru: Huh?\r\nKiyoka: I'm not sure if that's right, but I'm interested in talking about love too!\r\nKiyoka: When you become a high schooler, do you really start getting into that kind of thing!?\r\nKaoru: Nah, not really.\r\nEllen: We're too busy with missions, after all.\r\nKiyoka: That's disappointing...\r\nEllen: Now then, all that's left is a pillow fight!\r\nKaoru: Count me out-. I'm going to bed already, so don't wake me up-.\r\nEllen: You're not doing that-! Hiyah!\r\nKaoru: Whoa!? ...Don't hit me in the back of the head!\r\nEllen: I'm laser accurate!\r\nKaoru: Damnit, Ellen... Help me out with her, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: E-Err... Here!\r\nEllen: Hesitate like that and you'll never hit me!\r\nKaoru: You're open!\r\nKaoru: Owfh!?\r\nEllen: You're getting serious now, huh Kaoru! Hyah!\r\nKaoru: I can catch something like that easy! Hahh!\r\nEllen: I caught it too!\r\nKiyoka: I know we already started throwing them, but... is it really alright for us to have a pillow fight in a hotel like... Afwh!?\r\nKaoru: Hahaha! Never let your guard down, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: Why do you look like you're having the most fun with this, Kaoru-san!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/SB5mF34N1ZY\r\n[Nenegurumi - Kaoru: Start]: Let's Sell Nenegurumis\r\n\r\nSana: Oh, you're here, Kaoru.\r\nKaoru: You're the one who called me, right? So, what'd you need?\r\nKaoru: You're not about to push another annoying mission on me, are you?\r\nSana: We've decided to start selling Nenegurumis.\r\nKaoru: Huhh? What the heck's a \"Nenegurumi\"?\r\nSana: A Nene nuigurumi, so, Nenegurumi.\t\t[Nuigurumi are just stuffed toys/dolls, and I'm not punning around with the name]\r\nKaoru: Just leaving it at that!?\r\nKaoru: ...So, what do need me for with these Nenegurumis? You want to use Nene as a model?\r\nSana: No, we already went ahead and made them. Here's one.\r\nKaoru: Whoa!?\r\nKaoru: ...I-It's not the real Nene... right? I-I thought it was for a sec... It seriously looks just like him.\r\nSana: Kaoru, go and sell this.\r\nKaoru: Huhh!? Why do I have to do it!!\r\nSana: It's not forever; just for a limited time. You know the shopping mall? We rented a store there.\r\nKaoru: Saying that doesn't make it any better...\r\nSana: I called in somebody else to help too. So anyway, I'm counting on you, Kaoru.\r\nKaoru: Seriously...?\r\n\r\nFujikami Minaki: Ooh, you're here, Kaorucchi!\r\nKaoru: Then you're the other person, Minaki.\r\nMinaki: Sure am! Glad to be here!\r\nMinaki: ...So, what am I meant to be doing anyway?\r\nKaoru: Did that hag seriously leave all the explaining to me too...?\r\nKaoru: Nenegurumis... We're selling Nenegurumis. This thing.\r\nMinaki: That was just a doll!? No way; I thought it was the real one...\r\nKaoru: She said to sell these, but that's asking the impossible, right?\r\nMinaki: Won't these sell a whole lot? It's cute!\r\nKaoru: If you want it, you have it.\r\nMinaki: Really!?\r\nKaoru: I've got the real one anyway-.\r\nMinaki: Thanks a lot, Kaorucchi!

For how big this store is, we've got way too few people!\r\nKaoru: Give us more to work with-!\r\nMinaki: It's no use saying that now-.\r\nMinaki: We might only have two people here to set up, but more should be here to help this afternoon, so let's stick it out!\r\nKaoru: Minaki...\r\nMinaki: Kaorucchi!\r\nKaoru: ...If there's more coming to help, couldn't we call them now?\r\nMinaki: I thought I got you feeling motivated!?\r\nKaoru: Nah, nah, there's no way I'd be.

They had a lot to say about you! They were so happy to meet you!\r\nKaoru: Yeah. They sure were something. All full of energy.\r\nEllen: They're both so busy after all; they don't get a lot of free time to talk... Mama especially said she's head over heels for you!\r\nKaoru: Huh.\r\nEllen: When it comes to engineering, Papa and Mama give even Grandpa a run for his money!\r\nKaoru: Ooh.\r\nEllen: You haven't met my grandpa yet, have you? I want to show you how amazing he is already!\r\nKaoru: Ahh.\r\nEllen: ...Kaoru...? Are you listening?\r\nKaoru: I'm listening. But you keep going on and on about your family. I'm running out of reactions.\r\nEllen: Come on, don't be like that! I love my family so much, so I want to share with you all about them~!\r\nKaoru: I know, so I'll keep listening until you're satisfied, okay?\r\nEllen: That's what I love about you, Kaoru!\r\nEllen: Actually, I'm going on a trip with my family soon! It's been a while since the whole Kohagura family got together! I'm really looking forward to it!\r\nEllen: Papa and Mama said they're working extra hard to make sure they get time off for it...\r\nEllen: Oh! Speaking of which, Mama's calling me now! Mind if I take it?\r\nKaoru: Go ahead.\r\nEllen: Hi Mom! I can't wait to see you! ...\r\nEllen: ......Ah............OK...\r\nKaoru: ...\r\nEllen: She said the trip had to be postponed.\r\nKaoru: I see.\r\nEllen: It's not all that surprising though. Papa and Mama have so much to work on lately. This happens a lot.\r\nEllen: In fact, it was a real miracle everyone's schedules managed to free up like that! Like all the planets aligned!\r\nEllen: ...........\r\nEllen: But, it still hurts... I wanted to see them...\r\nEllen: Still, I can't be selfish.\r\nKaoru: I don't think it's all that selfish.\r\nKaoru: Ah, c'mon. Cheer up, Ellen. How about instead, on the day you were supposed to go on a trip, I'll go along with you to your favorite cake buffet?\r\nEllen: Kaoru... You're supposed to say \"you'll take me there\"-!\r\nKaoru: Fine, fine. You can eat as much as you want. Cause you're paying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Cake Buffet\r\n\r\nEllen: We're here... We're finally here... The caaaaake buffet---!\r\nEveryone: Yay-!\r\nEllen: The pure white cream, the light and fluffy texture, the bright and juicy fruits...\r\nEllen: Baked and non-baked, souffle and tarts, there's every cake you can imagine! Let's charge right in, everyone~!!\r\nKaoru: Go get your fill.\r\nKanami: Eh? Kaoru-chan, are you not having any?\r\nKaoru: I'll watch our seats. Ellen~, get some coffee for me~.\r\nKanami: Ellen-chan already raced in ahead of everyone...\r\nKaoru: Tch, too late, huh...\r\nKanami: Anyway, I'm going too-!\r\nKaoru: Ah, hey! That's where you're supposed to say \"Then, I'll get your coffee for you~\"!\r\nSayaka: Can I... Eat these...? Any of these...? All of these...?\r\nMai: Mmhm, it's fine. Eat whichever you like.\r\nSayaka: ...! ...I can't choose...\r\nMai: Fufu. Then, how about we pick out different types? We can taste each other's later.\r\nHiyori: Who would even want to eat all these sweets to begin with...\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan! There's a chocolate mint cake over here!\r\nHiyori: What!?\r\n\r\nKanami: We're back-! Time to eat-!\r\nKanami: Whoa!? Ellen-chan's surrounded by an army of cakes!\r\nEllen: No, no~! I've maneuvered this army right where I want them!\r\nHiyori: There's no way someone could that much, is there...?\r\nEllen: A piece of cake! I could have this before breakfast!\r\nKaoru: She's probably gonna go back two or three times for more.\r\nMai: Th-That's really something...\r\nSayaka: ...Mai. Did we not get enough...?\r\nMai: N-No, we're fine. I think that would be too much for even the two of us together.\r\nEllen: Everyone's ready, right? So we can start eating? Come on, hurry! Three, two...!\r\nEveryone: One-!\r\n\r\nEllen: Burp...... I-I ate too much... I can't move...\r\nKaoru: The cause of defeat was one helping too many.\r\nEllen: I thought I could at least finish one of everything... My greed got the better of me...\r\nKanami: Still, I can't believe you ate all that! You really love cakes, huh, Ellen-chan~?\r\nMai: Just looking at the satisfaction on her face made me start feeling happier.\r\nEllen: I really enjoyed it too, of course! Eating the cakes I love with the people I love; today I'm feeling 100% happy!\r\nEllen: ...Just, for a little bit... Let me rest...\r\nKaoru: Then I'll go get some cake and coffee.\r\nKaoru: They're probably putting out new cakes around now, in the wake of Ellen's rampage~.\r\nHiyori: You mean... Were you just waiting around knowing this would happen...?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: A Few Minutes of Vacation\r\n\r\nKaoru: Finally, we're in Izu. \r\nNene: Ne~!\r\nEllen: And the weather's so nice! Though it feels like we could be assigned a mission right away.\r\nKaoru: Since we're here and all, I wanna eat some of Izu's specialties. Ellen, do you know any?\r\nEllen: I'll look some up on my phone!\r\nEllen: ...Let's see... Izu has a lot of fishing ports, so it seems like they sell a lot of dried fish.\r\nEllen: They seem to have a lot of orange farms too. They must love picking oranges.\r\nKaoru: That sounds nice.\r\nEllen: And then, they have a local delicacy called \"Deep-Fried Dick\", apparently.\r\nKaoru: ...What's with that suggestive name?\r\nEllen: Seems like they mince up locally caught mackerel and squid, add vegetables like carrots, onions, and burdock, mix it all together, and fry it in oil.\r\nKaoru: Sounds delicious... I wanna eat it, but it'll be embarrassing to order.\r\nEllen: You're lewd, Kaoru.\r\nKaoru: You're the one who said it first.\r\nEllen: I just said what it's called~.\r\nKaoru: ......\r\nEllen: Oh! Sana-sensei's calling! Hello, what is it?\r\nEllen: ...Eh? An emergency assignment? So Kanamin and Hiyoyon made it to Izu, and we're supposed to meet up with and test them?\r\nKaoru: Well there goes our Izu sightseeing tour. Only got a few minutes out of it.\r\nNene: Ne~...\r\nEllen: There's no helping it. Accepting those two is more important than us getting a day off.\r\nKaoru: Oh yeah, so what about the investigation team?\r\nEllen: We just have to trust they can take care of themselves.\r\nEllen: We have to focus on our own mission, after all.\r\nKaoru: ...Man. After this is over, I want a long vacation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Vision of the Future\r\n\r\nEllen: Hiii-! Myaako-! I'm stopping by!\r\nSasano Miyako: ...You again. You sure come here a lot.\r\nEllen: Yes! Is it okay if I check out some of the data from the research department?\r\nMiyako: That's fine. If you want to continue what you were reading last time, it's on the shelf over there.\r\nEllen: Thanks as always!\r\nMiyako: ...Do you keep it a secret from your partner that you come here?\r\nEllen: Partner? You mean Kaoru?\r\nEllen: I invite her every time, but of course she always refuses, saying it \"Sounds lame~\".\r\nMiyako: I see. But isn't that normal?\r\nEllen: I guess? I think Kaoru gets a little abnormally annoyed with everything though~.\r\nMiyako: Well, you have a real passion for researching developments into new anti-aradama technology.\r\nMiyako: Especially \"suppression methods that don't involve the use of toji\". I don't think many toji in active duty would have such an interest in that field.\r\nEllen: ...\r\nMiyako: Do you really hate fighting that much? Or does this... Have something to do with Mokusa?\r\nEllen: ...Myaako. No matter how alone we are, that's being too careless.\r\nMiyako: You're right. I'm sorry.\r\nEllen: I'm really glad I could be a toji. I have the strength to keep everyone safe and happy, after all.\r\nEllen: But a toji's power doesn't last forever. I won't always be able to go on like this.\r\nEllen: So when my power fades, I want to take the path of an engineer like my esteemed papa and mama.\r\nEllen: With an okatana now, and with technology someday. That's how I'll always be able to continue fighting to protect people!\r\nEllen: Coming here is just laying the groundwork for that. So if I had to say, my research here is for my own benefit.\r\nMiyako: ...That's unexpected. I didn't think you considered those things.\r\nEllen: It's the first time I've told anyone about it too! I'm feeling sort of embarrassed...\r\nMiyako: Really? I see you in a different light now.\r\nEllen: Ooh! If it made Myaako fall for me all over again, then it was worth revealing.\r\nEllen: Though, saying all that, no one knows what could happen in the future.\r\nEllen: It might be that, somehow, I end up being the first ever lifetime toji, you know!\r\nMiyako: Who can say.\r\nMiyako: ...By the way, there were some interesting results in yesterday's incident report. Want to take a look?\r\nEllen: Of course!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: The Fighting Toji-san\r\n\r\nKagami Mimi: Ah, it's Ellen~! Ellen, Ellen, Ellen~!\r\nEllen: Wow, Mimimin! Are you done studying for the day?\r\nMimi: Yeah! All done~! Hey, Ellen, will you play with me again today?\r\nEllen: Sure thing~! What'd you have in mind?\r\nMimi: Awesome-! I thought we could play samurai-!\r\nEllen: But you're so strong, Mimimin-! Last time I was defeated... But this time, I'll show you my true power!\r\nMimi: Ahaha! You always say that, but you always end up losing!\r\nEllen: Fufufu... Don't make the mistake of comparing me to last time...\r\nEllen: ---!\r\nEllen: (My spectrum finder picked something up... It's right near the school...)\r\nEllen: Sorry, Mimimin-! Seems like I have some toji work to do. We can settle this later, okay?\r\nMimi: Ehh-!?\r\nMimi: Ah, then I'll go with you! With both of us together, we can beat that aradama in no time!\r\nEllen: That's a great idea. But this is work for your onee-san. It's still a bit too early for you, Mimimin.\r\nEllen: The aradama's close by, so don't leave the school. Promise me that, okay?\r\nMimi: 'Kay...\r\nEllen: Then, I'm going! I'll be right back-!\r\nMimi: ...But that's so boring. I figured Ellen would have said it's fine for me to go...\r\nMimi: I know~. I'll sneak out and beat the aradama.\r\nMimi: She said not to, but I bet Ellen'll be so surprised and praise me a lot~!\r\n\r\nMimi: ...Ah, Ellen's over there! Which means that bad aradama must be around too...\r\nMimi: ...Eh?\r\nAradama: GRURURUUUU......\r\nMimi: ...A-Ah... No, don't come near me...!\r\nEllen: Mimimin!!\r\nMimi: Ah... Ellen...!\r\nEllen: Hide behind me. I won't let it hurt you.\r\n\r\nEllen: ......Phew. Mimimin, did you get hurt?\r\nMimi: N-No...\r\nEllen: Didn't you hear me say not to come?\r\nMimi: ...! Sor-I'm sorry...!\r\nMimi: I do so good in practice, so I thought I could fight already... But I couldn't move a muscle...\r\nMimi: I'm sorry, Ellen. Sorry I broke my promise. Please don't hate me...!\r\nEllen: Don't cry, Mimimin. I could never hate you.\r\nEllen: I was just really worried. I'm glad you're safe.\r\nMimi: ...You're an amazing toji, Ellen... You looked so cool when you were fighting.\r\nEllen: Didn't I tell you, Mimimin? That I'd show you my true power~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/BHI45rWeMrA\r\n[New Year's Ellen: Start]: Hanetsuki Competition!\r\n\r\nKanami: The crowd of people here for their first shrine visit sure is huge.\r\nEllen: But it's also a part of the season here in Japan. It's fun waiting around in all the commotion.\r\nKaoru: And here I thought I'd get to laze around at home through New Year's-.\r\nNene: Nene-!\r\nSayaka: Mai... You don't have to hold my hand anymore. I won't get lost.\r\nMai: Ah, that's right. Sorry, I've been holding on all this time.\r\nSayaka: It's okay... Your hand was warm.\r\nKanami: Hey, Hiyori-chan, what'd you pray for?\r\nHiyori: To be in good health. What about you?\r\nKanami: Well, to meet more strong toji this year! That's what I wished for.\r\nHiyori: That sounds like something you'd do, but I guess there's nothing wrong with it.\r\nEllen: What should we do now? We could draw fortune slips, or get sweet sake; or a whole bunch of things!\r\nMai: Since I'm here at the shrine, I thought I would buy some protective charms for my family, then bring them back home.\r\nEllen: That sounds nice too. Hmm, I can't make up my mind. Isn't there some kind of special event you do at New Year's?\r\nKaoru: It's not really an event, but what if we do that?\r\nKanami: Ah! We could play hanetsuki! \t[Hanetsuki is a game similar to badminton, traditionally played at New Year's]\r\nEllen: Looks like fun! Let's do it!\r\nHiyori: I'll pass. You can have fun on your--\r\nKaoru: Don't you know, Eternal? Playing hanetsuki is considered an act of prayer for a girl's development.\r\nNene: Ne~?\r\nHiyori: ...!!\r\nKaoru: You sure you want to miss out? I guess it's only just a prayer, after all-.\r\nEllen: So then, Kanamin and I will be playing?\r\nHiyori: Wait, I'm playing too...!\r\nKaoru: ......Heh.\r\nKanami: If Hiyori-chan feels like playing, then I'll be the referee.\r\nSayaka: ...What will you do, Mai?\r\nMai: Let's see... I'll go pick out protective charms while I still can. If I let too much time go by, I think it'll be too crowded.\r\nSayaka: Then, I'll go too.\r\nMai: Okay. Let's get going then. We're going to go buy some charms for a bit, okay?\r\nKanami: Ah, alright! We'll see you later, Mai-chan, Sayaka-chan.\r\nEllen: Getting to compete with Hiyoyon like this is making me excited. I'm not about to lose, okay-?\r\nHiyori: I don't plan on losing either.\r\nKaoru: You can do it-. 'Cause I'll be cheering for you-.\r\nEllen: Kaoru, please cheer for me too-!\r\nKaoru: Yeah, you can do it too, Ellen-.\r\nKanami: Give it your best shot, you two~!\r\nEllen: Hiyoyon, here I go-? Let's start! There-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[New Year's Ellen: End]: Fun Together!\r\n\r\nHiyori: HA-!\r\nEllen: Not bad, Hiyoyon! HO-!\r\nKanami: That's crazy! They've been going for so long now. Other people who came to the shrine are starting to watch too.\r\nKaoru: Yep, that's Hiyori alright. It's like she's becoming one with the hagoita. [Flat paddle used in hanetsuki]\r\nHiyori: Kaoru... Could you... Shut up-!\r\nEllen: How about this? HA-!!\r\nHiyori: ...Kh!\r\nKanami: That settles it; Ellen-chan's the winner.\r\nEllen: I did it! Hanetsuki's pretty fun~, isn't it.\r\nKaoru: As a rule, you're supposed to draw on the loser with black ink, but we haven't got any. Too bad...\r\nEllen: That reminds me, did you know about this?\r\nEllen: The hagoita is a tool you use for hanetsuki, but, a long time ago, it seems like it was customary to give them to girls on New Year's, as a charm to ward off misfortune.\r\nKanami: Huh-, so hagoita used to be used like that.\r\nEllen: So, Kanamin and Kaoru, are you going to be playing next?\r\nKaoru: Nah, I'm good.\r\nKanami: Ehh-. Kaoru-chan-, come on-.\r\nKaoru: Visiting a crowded shrine like this takes way more out of you than I expected. That's why, I've got to preserve my stamina, just in case.\r\nKanami: Ah, then to make up for it, we can have a match together some other time! Then I can spar against you, Kaoru-chan! Would that work?\r\nKaoru: Oi, why do we have to make up for it... Fine, I'll think about it. But only think about it.\r\nMai: We're back. Are you all taking a break?\r\nHiyori: Yeah. Or, actually, we might be done now.\r\nSayaka: You're done... playing hanetsuki?\r\nEllen: If you two feel like playing, then we can keep going. What do you think, Saaya?\r\nSayaka: I'm... fine with not playing.\r\nMai: I agree, I think I'm fine not playing too.\r\nEllen: In that case, next up, should we all go draw our fortune slips for the year?\r\nKanami: Ellen-chan, let's go check out the food stands after that!\r\nEllen: I was just thinking the same thing, Kanamin! You and I are on the same page.\r\nSayaka: Me too... I'm looking forward to the food stands.\r\nKanami: Ehehe. It's kind of nice, isn't it? Doing this kind of thing. I hope we can all have a lot more fun again this year-.\r\nEllen: Alll-right, let's all have another fun year together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/j47iC8Z6kho\r\n[Casual '20 - Ellen: Start]: The Pair's New Year's Eve\r\n\r\nAradama: GUOOOOO...\r\nKaoru: They're still coming? Oi, Aradama, could you at least take it easy on New Year's Eve...\r\nEllen: Kaoru, complaining to the aradama won't do you any good. We're nearly through with this year's missions. Let's give it one last push!\r\nEllen: I'm going in! HAAAAAAAAAAAH!\r\nAradama: Keeeee...\r\nKaoru: Alright, guess that's it for this year's slave labor. Another long year jammed with work after work...\r\nEllen: Good job pulling through another year! Or, that's what I'd like to say, but... the spectrum finder is still picking something up.\r\nKaoru: Sigh... Everybody else's already on their New Year's break, but we don't even get this or Obon off...\r\nNene: Nee...\r\nEllen: Kaoru, Nene, there's not much left to do, so let's try our best! After this mission's over, there's my Papa and Mama's countdown party waiting for us!\r\nKaoru: Yeah, that's right. The luxury party they rented out a huge room at a high class hotel for.\r\nEllen: With delicious food, and all the amazing sweets you could want! So let's finish this mission quick, so we can make it in time for the party.\r\nKaoru: Well, it's true that, after all the work we've done, you'd want spend at least the very end of the year getting treated for it.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\n\r\nKaoru: Sigh... I can't do any more after this. There can't be any more of them, right?\r\nEllen: You did great! It seems we cleared out the aradama, so that means this year's missions are finally complete!\r\nEllen: If we race back to the party now, we should make it in time for the countdown! Let's hurry!\r\n\r\nKaoru: Nobody's here...\r\nNene: Nee...\r\nEllen: Apparently the party ended while we were stuck in traffic. Sorry to disappoint you, Kaoru.\r\nKaoru: Nah, it's fine. This is just how things go for us cogs in the system... It's actually the perfect New Year's for drones like us. Come on, might as well go home and go to bed.\r\nEllen: Hold on a moment! Over there, there's one table with food still laid out!\r\nKaoru: Ohh, you're right! Don't tell me they left it for us?\r\nEllen: That's what it looks like. There's a message card from Papa and Mama, and a New Year's Present too.\r\nKaoru: Present? This envelope done up in a ribbon? What's inside?\r\nEllen: It's a keycard.\r\nKaoru: A keycard? And where does that get us into?\r\nEllen: Fufu. That's something you can look forward to finding out later!\r\nEllen: Anyway, Kaoru, we might not have made it in time for the countdown, but let's celebrate New Year's.\r\nEllen: Let's start with a toast! Kaoru, Nene, thanks so much for everything this past year. I'm looking forward to spending the next year with you too.\r\nEllen: Cheers!\r\n\r\nKaoru: Fwah, I'm stuffed. My stomach's too full to move anymore.\r\nNene: Nee...\r\nEllen: I'm glad it put you back in a better mood!\r\nEllen: I just got a message from Kanamin. Wow! So she and Hiyoyon went and did their first shrine visit. Take a look, Kaoru; they look like they're having fun in this picture.\r\nKaoru: Hahah... Those are some nice smiles. Look at them, enjoying their New Year's break.\r\nEllen: There's more too. \"We're going to the mountaintop now to see the first sunrise. Do you and Kaoru-chan want to join us?\"\r\nKaoru: The first sunrise... Sorry, but I'm dead after that mission, and, after eating that much, I don't have it in me to go out again.\r\nKaoru: Besides, I'm not even sure I can stay up till sunrise. And there's just no way I'm climbing up a mountain and sitting in the cold until it comes up.\r\nKaoru: Seriously, the timing this year's been the worst right out the gate.\r\nNene: Nee.\r\nEllen: Come on and cheer up, Kaoru, Nene. I've got a good idea!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Casual '20 - Ellen: End]: The Happy New Year Plan\r\n\r\nKanami: Ellen-chan, Kaoru-chan, Happy New Year!\r\nHiyori: Leave it to Ellen to have a room at a fancy hotel like this for a party.\r\nEllen: Kanamin, Hiyoyon, thanks for coming. And, Happy New Year to you too.\r\nKaoru: Oi, Ellen, it's great and all you called those two here, but we're already done with the food.\r\nEllen: I know. Now that Kanamin and Hiyoyon are here, let's move on to the next attraction!\r\nKaoru: The next attraction?\r\nEllen: We'll take the keycard Papa and Mama left us and go someplace nice!\r\nKanami: Someplace nice? Hiyori-chan, don't you want to go see!\r\nHiyori: Why not. Since she asked us to call off our plans to see the sunrise, whatever it is must be something amazing.\r\n\r\nEllen: We're here!\r\nKaoru: And where's \"here\"...?\r\nEllen: The members-only lounge on the hotel's top floor! The sunrise you can see from up here is very beautiful.\r\nHiyori: So that's why. It's hard to tell since it's still night out, but I'm sure a floor this high gets a good view of it.\r\nKanami: Thanks, Ellen-chan! Now if it could only be sunrise already-.\r\nEllen: It's still going to take a while, so let's have some tea while we wait! Here, Kaoru, some warm milk tea for you.\r\nKaoru: Fwahh~, that's good stuff. Sitting out in the cold until the sun came up wasn't gonna happen, but I feel like I could wait for hours like this.\r\nKaoru: The heater's working, the sofa's sucking me in... Yawnn... Getting sleepy...\r\nKaoru: [snooze...]\r\nNene: Nenee...\r\nKanami: Kaoru-chan fell asleep just sitting down, huh.\r\nHiyori: She must be tired, since she was working missions all the way to New Year's Eve.\r\nEllen: How about we let her sleep like this until the sunrise.\r\n\r\nKaoru: [sleepy breathing...]\r\nEllen: Kaoru, wake up now. The sun's just about to come up.\r\nKaoru: ...Nn? Feels like Ellen's voice is right in my ear...\r\nKaoru: Ah-- I must've passed out on your lap at some point.\r\nEllen: Yes, you were sleeping like a baby.\r\nEllen: Kaoru, the sun's going to be coming up out the windows over there. Let's go see.\r\nKaoru: Yeah, I'd love to go see it, but... Between this cushy sofa and your lap, I'm feeling so cozy my body's refusing to get up.\r\nNene: Nee...\r\nKaoru: Even while we're talking, I feel like I'm about to drift off again... Sorry Ellen, for being like this first thing in the year.\r\nEllen: It's alright, Kaoru. Even like this, you can still see out the window.\r\nEllen: Ah, looks like the sun is out.\r\nKaoru: You're right. The morning sun's shining real bright.\r\nEllen: It's looking to be another good year. Happy New Year, Kaoru. Let's stay strong and give it our best this year too."}, {"paste_key": "7aemGXhg", "title": "2-1 On a New Mission", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/7aemGXhg", "timestamp": "", "hits": "336", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz-N2DwEBLU\r\n\r\n1: Momentary Peace and a New Journey (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: Mmmm~, yummy! When it comes to crepes, chocolate covered bananas with creme fraiche is such a must have!\r\nKofuki: So annoying. Can't you just shut up and eat?\r\nMihono: Don't you know? When you're eating something yummy, it tastes ten times better when you say it while you eat!\r\nKofuki: That's retarded. Don't tell me you believe that.\r\nKiyoka: But, it really is yummy. My cheeks feel like they're melting.\r\nMihono: Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean! What'd you order, Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: Strawberry ice cream with chocolate whipped cream.\r\nMihono: Ahhh, I wanted that one too! I spent so long trying to decide between these.\r\nKiyoka: Want to taste mine?\r\nMihono: Can I!?\r\nKiyoka: Mm... Go ahead.\r\nMihono: Then, I'll take you up on that! Om-\r\nMihono: Mmmhm~, so yummy! The cold ice cream and the crepe taste so good together!\r\nMihono: Here, to make things even, try some of mine.\r\nKiyoka: Th-Thank you... I'll try some- Om...\r\nKiyoka: Mhmm! This is yummy... It's so yummy, Hono-chan!\r\nMihono: I told you! Ehehe. Want some too, Fukki?\r\nKofuki: I don't need any.\r\nMihono: C'mon, just take a bite!\r\nKofuki: I said I don't need any! Leave me alone!\r\n\r\nChie: Ufufu. Watching them really calms me down.\r\nMirja: It's good to see everyone so peaceful, but we need to discuss what we'll be doing next.\r\nMirja: First, we should-\r\nAradama: GURURUUUUUU...!\r\nChie: Aradama!?\r\nKofuki: Alright; nothing like some exercise after eating! You came out just to see me, didn't you? Well I love you too, aradama-chan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1: Momentary Peace and a New Journey (1)\r\n\r\nMirja: As I was saying before we were interrupted, I believe we should return to Kamakura as part of our mission to locate both the Akabane swords and Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu.\r\nMirja: Do any of you disagree?\r\nKofuki: Looking for the Akabane swords means we get to slice up all the aradama-chans that are with them, doesn't it?\r\nMirja: That goes without saying. Eliminating aradama is our duty as toji.\r\nKofuki: Hell yeah-! So long as I get to play around with aradama-chan, I'm down for whatever!\r\nMihono: It's all still pretty confusing, so I'll just follow you, Mirja-san.\r\nKiyoka: I think... I think that's a good plan too.\r\nChie: ...\r\nMirja: What do you think, Setouchi Chie?\r\nChie: If I'm being honest, I still don't trust y- President Souraku.\r\nChie: But I'll go along with that, for now.\r\nMirja: Thank you. Then, let's get going.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: To Kamakura (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: I get that we're looking for Kagemitsu, but do we have any clues? Like, \"it might be around here~\" or something.\r\nMirja: I'm afraid to say we're completely in the dark.\r\nKofuki: You've seriously got nothing?\r\nMirja: Each lead that we've found so far has been a bust, which has left us with nothing of any note to go off of.\r\nKiyoka: So we'll just have to look everywhere until we find something...\r\nMirja: That's all we can do in our current state.\r\nMihono: So, we should just focus on tracking down Akabane swords right now?\r\nKofuki: I'm all for it. Wherever those swords are, there's bound to be aradama-chans swarming around.\r\nKofuki: Sounds way better than a wild goose chase, doesn't it?\r\nKiyoka: Sigh~... That means there's lots more fighting in store for us, isn't there...\r\nKofuki: Don't worry about it. I'll take care of every last aradama-chan. You guys just hang back and relax.\r\nChie: You know we can't do that. We're all going to work together out there.\r\nKofuki: I mean it! I don't want you ruining any of my fun~.\r\n*Chie starts drawing her okatana*\r\nChie: Ufufu, we're all going to work together, aren't we?\r\nKofuki: Seriiiously~...\r\nChie: We're ALL going to work together, aren't we?\r\nKofuki: Tch... Fine, whatever.\r\nChie: Ufufu. Your onee-san's happy you're being so understanding.\r\n*Chie puts her okatana away*\r\nMihono: Chii-nee's kinda scary sometimes, isn't she?\r\nKiyoka: ...U-Uh huh.\r\nMihono: By the way, what kinda okatana is this Kagemitsu?\r\nMirja: It's a tachi, made at the tail end of the Kamakura period by the artisan Kagemitsu of the Bizen Province.\r\nMirja: In the year 1568, before his invasion of Suruga, Takeda Shingen offered it to the Sengen Shrine.\r\nMihono: Okay, I get the history, but why is it so good against a great aradama? What makes it different from any other okatana?\r\nMirja: In that case...\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAAA!\r\nKofuki: What's that? You followed me too, huh? You're always welcome, my lovely aradama-chan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: To Kamakura (2)\r\n\r\nKofuki: Alright, enough warmup. Let's get going where we're going. Just lead me to the aradama.\r\nMirja: Be sure not to lose sight of our objective. The missions we were given were simply to locate the Akabane swords and Kagemitsu.\r\nMirja: Hunting aradama is not our priority. So please refrain yourself from acting so independently.\r\nKofuki: I got it already... But we're going to end up fighting them anyway, right? So it's all the same.\r\nMirja: Depending on the circumstances, that may not always be the case. But I can't deny that here and now.\r\nMirja: Anyway, if we're all prepared, shall we leave for Kamakura now?\r\nMihono: I'm ready anytime!\r\nKiyoka: I-I'm ready to go as well... I think.\r\nKofuki: Do I have to say it? Let's go already!\r\nChie: I don't have any problem with that.\r\nMirja: Then, let's depart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Unease (1)\r\n\r\nChie: (Blindly searching for Kagemitsu like this will get us nowhere. We're only being sent out here to waste time.)\r\nChie: (And President Souraku surely didn't tell us the whole story. She has to be hiding something.)\r\nChie: (Until I know what that is, I can't trust President Souraku, and Mirja-san too...)\r\nChie: (I'd better ask for support from Mokusa in getting to the bottom of this.)\r\n*phone ringing*\r\nChie: .........\r\nChie: (...? That's strange. No one's answering? There should always be someone responding to the emergency undercover line...)\r\nChie: (I hope I'm only overthinking this, but I can't help but feel uneasy...)\r\nAradama: KIKIKIGIGIGIGIGIGI...\r\nChie: More aradama!?\r\nKofuki: More and more-! I've been waiting for you, aradama-chans! Come get your love!\r\nMirja: Everyone, get ready for combat! We're going to eliminate all the aradama!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6: Unease (2)\r\n\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie, your movements lacked their usual responsiveness. Is something bothering you?\r\nChie: ...I'm fine.\r\nMihono: But your face is all pale. Are you sure?\r\nChie: Thanks for worrying about me. But I'm fine.\r\nMihono: Really? If something's wrong, you can always tell us. I might not be able to help, but I'll do whatever I can!\r\nChie: Ufu, you're so kind, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: But you've always been looking out for me, Chii-nee. So let me return the favor sometimes!\r\nKiyoka: M-Me too... You can rely on me... I'm always needing your help, after all...\r\nKiyoka: Ah... S-Sorry... There's probably nothing I could do to help though, is there...\r\nChie: No, that's not true. I'm glad to see you two becoming more reliable.\r\nMihono: We're teammates, after all! When one of us is in trouble, of course the others'll help out! Right, Fukki?\r\nKofuki: Why're you dragging me into this? Like I care!\r\nMihono: Ehh~, c'mon~!\r\nKiyoka: The more we trust in each other, the easier it will be to cooperate... And that should mean... Fighting will get easier...\r\nMihono: Yeah, yeah! Kiyoka's got the right idea!\r\nKofuki: And that doesn't matter to me. I just do what I want.\r\nMihono: Fukki-, you gotta open up some more!\r\nKofuki: Aghh, just leave me out of this! Go away! Shoo, shoo!\r\nChie: (\"Teammates\"...)\r\nChie: (I'm sorry, Mihono-chan. I just can't think of her like that.)\r\nChie: (At least, for the time being...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7: Mokusa Under Attack (1)\r\n\r\n*phone ringing*\r\nChie: .........\r\nChie: (This shouldn't be happening; I still can't get through to Mokusa. It's clear that something's wrong.)\r\nChie: (I have a bad feeling about all this... What's going on over there?)\r\n\r\nAt the same time, at the Mokusa hideout--\r\n\r\nMai: Takako-san, hurry and get on!\r\nYonemura Takako: ...Leave without me.\r\nMai: Eh!? Takako-san!\r\nTakako: Keep Akane-sama safe.\r\nMai: Takako-san!!\r\nYume: Ahhh~, I didn't make it in time, huh...? Too bad.\r\nTakako: ...What happened to the toji at the shrine?\r\nYume: Toji? That's what they were supposed to be? They barely even put up a fight though...\r\nYume: Ahh, but the one with this okatana, she wasn't too bad.\r\n*Yume throws it at Takako's feet*\r\nTakako: Satomi...!\r\nYume: You wanna fight? In that state? I'll wait for you to recover if you want.\r\nTakako: I don't need your pity!\r\nTakako: I'd never lose to a toji that needs noro to fight!\r\nYume: Is that so.\r\n\r\nChie: (Please let everyone be okay...)\r\nAradama: KIKIKIGIGIGIGIGIGI...\r\nChie: I really don't need this right now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Mokusa Under Attack (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Pant, pant, pant...\r\nChie: One more time... If I call Mokusa one more time...\r\n*phone ringing*\r\nChie: .........\r\nChie: (...Everyone... What am I supposed to do? What can I even do right now...)\r\nChie: (No good... It's hopeless. If I just knew what's happening to Mokusa...)\r\nMirja: What's wrong? You're acting nothing like your usual self. What has you so shaken up?\r\nChie: ...I said it's nothing.\r\nMirja: I understand if you feel like you can't trust me. But I can't overlook what my teammates are going through.\r\nChie: Teammates?\r\nMirja: At least, that's how I feel about you. And... I want to help.\r\nMirja: If you still won't talk to me, do you think you could open up to Asakura Mihono or one of the others?\r\nMirja: There are some problems you can't solve by yourself, but when you share it with others you start to see a solution.\r\nChie: Mirja-san...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9: What Takes Priority (1)\r\n\r\nChie: There's something I need to say. Will you all listen to me?\r\nMihono: What's up? Why are you acting so serious, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: (I can't shake the way I feel about Mirja-san, but I think I can trust the way she feels about me.)\r\nChie: (And, as long as I'm worried about Mokusa, my personal feelings will get in the way of our mission. I have to let it all out.)\r\nChie: First, let me apologize. There's something I've been hiding from all of you. I'm sorry.\r\nKofuki: What, you've been stealing into our snacks? Your tits have been looking fatter lately.\r\nKiyoka: U-Uhh... I don't think, with this atmosphere... I think we should... Take this more seriously...\r\nKofuki: Hey, don't act like I'm the one screwing around. So, what's your deal, Chichie? This is getting annoying, so spit it out already.\r\nChie: It wasn't a coincidence that I joined this investigation team. On behalf of a certain organization, I was assigned here.\r\nMihono: ...! What organization? ...Chii-nee, what are you talking about?\r\nChie: Do you remember how I told you Osafune had been looking into the experiments with noro the Origami family was doing?\r\nMihono: ...Y-Yeah. So you're just talking about Osafune?\r\nChie: To be precise, Osafune is where it all started: the organization \"Mokusa\".\r\nChie: Planning to start a revolution against Origami Yukari, and to return okatana and toji to their rightful state, Mokusa was formed. And I'm one of its members.\r\nMihono: So, uh... What does that mean?\r\nKofuki: She's a terrorist, right?\r\nKiyoka: Terro... Eh...?\r\nChie: Call me a terrorist if you want. But after seeing the results of their experiments with noro, don't you have a problem with the way Origami Yukari has been handling things?\r\nKofuki: Not my problem. But honestly, I couldn't care less about what you're up to either, Chichie.\r\nMirja: ...And so you joined this investigation team to feed us information from Mokusa.\r\nMirja: It was Mokusa's intention to lead us to Suruga, wasn't it?\r\nChie: Yes, that's right. I was supposed to show you what Origami Yukari was doing, and what she had done.\r\nChie: In the time we've been together, I've told you all many lies to lead you on.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee...\r\nChie: I don't really regret the path I've chosen, but that alone leaves me with a heavy heart... Pretty selfish of me to complain about it though, huh.\r\nMirja: I now know what you are, but what I don't understand is why you would choose now to reveal this to us.\r\nMirja: This isn't just because you couldn't bear the guilt, is it. So what is it you want \"us\" to do?\r\nChie: For hours now, I haven't been able to contact Mokusa. I've never heard of this happening once before. There's definitely something wrong.\r\nChie: I want to know what's going on. And to do that... I need your help. That's all I want right now.\r\nChie: Given everything I've done, I'd understand if you don't want to work with me. But... Still...\r\nMihono: It's okay, Chii-nee! I... I trust you, Chii-nee.\r\nMihono: You might have lied to us. And you might have led us around. But...\r\nMihono: But you said all of that hurt your heart. And you came clean and told us everything. So I'll trust you, Chii-nee!\r\nMihono: I don't really understand what the head of the family is thinking, but I think it's wrong using aradama like that!\r\nMihono: Even if everyone else says no, I'm on your side!\r\nKiyoka: M-Me too...! If one of us is in trouble, it's only natural to help each other out...\r\nMihono: And of course, Fukki's fine with it too, right?\r\nKofuki: I told you, I don't care what Chichie's up to. All I want is to have a good time with aradama.\r\nKofuki: If helping Chichie lets me do that, then whatever else doesn't matter.\r\nChie: Thank you, all of you...\r\nMihono: What about you, Mirja-san?\r\nMirja: Considering what the head of the family has been up to recently, I do find it difficult keeping my faith in her.\r\nMirja: And I suspect it may in some way be the result of what President Souraku explained to us about a great aradama.\r\nMirja: However, there is far too little information for me to make a clear decision. Until I find out more, I can't confidently ally myself with either side.\r\nMirja: Therefore, I've decided I'll have to hear Mokusa make their case directly.\r\nMirja: That's all there is to it, Setouchi Chie. I'll do what I can to aid you.\r\nChie: Thank you, Mirja-san.\r\nMirja: You don't need to thank me. I simply believe it's something I need to do.\r\nMihono: So then-\r\nAradama: SSSSHHAAAAAAAAAAA!\r\nMihono: Come onnn, we're in the middle of a really important conversation here! Read the mood, aradama!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10: What Takes Priority (2)\r\n\r\nMirja: Let me confirm something, Setouchi Chie. You want to know Mokusa's current status... That's your highest priority right now, isn't it?\r\nChie: Yes, that's right.\r\nMirja: I don't have the full picture yet, but from the way you've spoken about Mokusa, it's not a small organization, is it?\r\nMirja: If that's the case, shouldn't there be other operatives in the field gathering information?\r\nMirja: I recommend that we get in contact with whichever of them you are aware is closest to us now.\r\nChie: Ah... That would have worked... \"The one I'm aware is closest to us now\"...\r\nChie: I was careless... I was so panicked I couldn't think of something that simple...\r\nChie: There's a good chance they'll be able to shed some light on this situation...\r\nChie: Everyone, we're going back to Aoto-kan."}, {"paste_key": "jkDL1msH", "title": "Etou Kanami Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/jkDL1msH", "timestamp": "", "hits": "232", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx3GrvHwUcI\r\nhttps://youtu.be/bXYlq8dSvxI\r\nhttps://youtu.be/eNoknnmG1eI\r\nhttps://youtu.be/JHZISRWAzhM\r\nhttps://youtu.be/JHZISRWAzhM\r\nhttps://youtu.be/bUqlN1QeE1o\r\nhttps://youtu.be/KlIqfSZ3Cl8\r\nhttps://youtu.be/eY-_-MB4L7A\r\nhttps://youtu.be/zv49ocfI1Eo\r\nhttps://youtu.be/SLmEfJhjktU\r\nhttps://youtu.be/wCKVDULo_UY\r\nhttps://youtu.be/U1jobRU1Nr4\r\nhttps://youtu.be/_0ke0wRCknw\r\nhttps://youtu.be/m5rpY-umfYk\r\n\r\n1: The Match That Started It\r\n\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan's my opponent in the semi-finals?\r\nKanami: Reaching the finals means getting to participate in the tournament, so nobody wants to lose here! Let's do our best!\r\nKanami: The strongest toji from every school bringing all kinds of styles together to fight... Who could pass that up~!\r\nMihono: Ugh... Just one more match and I would've safely guaranteed my way into the tournament... But of course I'm already up against the last boss...\r\nMihono: I really wanted to save Kanami for the finals~.\r\nKanami: Winning or losing doesn't matter in the finals, so we could've had a friendly fight. But this way makes it so much more exciting!\r\nMihono: (...She says that, but I'm pretty sure Kanami's stronger than me by a long shot...)\r\nMihono: (Kanami's always so carefree. Meanwhile, I'm freaking out over here... But!)\r\nMihono: I didn't come all this way to lose! I want to make it to the tournament too! So let's go!\r\nKanami: Let's do it! Let's have fun together!\r\nMihono: ...! Yeah!\r\nReferee: The semi-finals for the tournament qualifiers will now begin. Bow!\r\nMihono/Kanami: ......\r\nReferee: --Begin!\r\n\r\nKanami: (Right... No, left! I can dodge it...)\r\nKanami: (No way! I mistimed her attack!?)\r\nKanami: (Amazing. Mihono-chan's swordsmanship... I've never seen anything like this rhythm! She's throwing off all my predictions!)\r\nKanami: (What kind of tactic will she use next? Block, dodge, attack... What's next?)\r\nKanami: (I want to see it all. I want you to show me everything, Mihono-chan!)\r\nMihono: (Whoa!? Kanami's got a really dirty grin on her face!)\r\nMihono: (But... I get it. --I'm enjoying this too!)\r\nMihono: (I always used to think the difference between us was so great that she never had to try.)\r\nMihono: (That her carefree attitude meant she'd just drag on the fight and end it whenever she wanted to.)\r\nMihono: (But that's wrong. Kanami has always been giving it everything she's got... All so she can enjoy this moment!)\r\nMihono: (I want to surprise Kanami even more with my skill... I want to beat Kanami!)\r\n\r\nReferee: That's enough!\r\nKanami: .....Phew~!\r\nMihono: I lost~~~~!\r\nKanami: I had no idea which of us would win right up till the end! That was such a good match~.\r\nMihono: But I let it end... This sucks. This really really sucks.\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan...\r\nMihono: ...Still... That was so much fun!\r\nKanami: ! Yeah, for me too! I had a great time-!\r\nReferee: Etou-san, you'll be entering the finals shortly. Please prepare yourself.\r\nKanami: Ah... Okay! I'll be right there!\r\nMihono: Good luck out there, Kanami!\r\nKanami: Thanks! I'm going!\r\n\r\nKanami: ...I'm so glad. Mihono-chan enjoyed it as much as I did!\r\nKanami: But, at the end there, it seemed like Mihono-chan suddenly lost all her momentum... Did something happen to her?\r\nKanami: Ahh, my heart's still pounding...! I didn't have enough time to talk to her just now...\r\nKanami: I'll have to tell Mihono-chan later! Just how amazing her swordsmanship was!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Kanami's Slightly Weird Point\r\n\r\nKanami: Ahh, today's lessons really wore me out. I'm feeling hungry-!\r\nMai: I brought some cookies with me. Do you want them?\r\nKanami: Eh, really!? Then let's eat them together in my room!\r\n\r\nMai: I'm coming in~.\r\nMai: Oh? Did you get a new plushie?\r\nKanami: Ah! That's \"Eruption Angel Fabulous-san\", from the recent anime \"Hell Angel Marvelous-chan\"!\r\nKanami: Isn't she cute!\r\nMai: Eh... S-She sure is. What a unique looking character.\r\nKanami: But apparently the ratings were so terrible that they shut the whole series down. Sigh... I was pretty shocked when I found out.\r\nKanami: For some reason, all the anime I like end up like that.\r\nKanami: These plushies were actually a part of a clearance sale. As soon as I found out, I knew I just had to give them a home!\r\nMai: R-Really? ...Strangely enough, the more I look at it, it might be getting cuter...? Like I can't take my eyes off it.\r\nKanami: That's it! It's that bit of ugliness that makes her so cute!\r\nMai: You have some slightly strange tastes, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: You think so? She might look a little too ugly for you now, but I bet if you watched the anime you'd fall in love!\r\nMai: Ufufu, I'm getting a little interested with the way you keep insisting, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: You should try it!\r\nKanami: By the way, can we eat those cookies now? My stomach's at its limit~.\r\nMai: Of course!\r\nKanami: Hooray-!\r\nKanami: ...Mmm! They're as good as ever!\r\nMai: Fufu, thanks.\r\nKanami: Oh, I know! You can have one of my \"Hell Angel Marvelous-chan\" plushies, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: Eh, are you sure?\r\nKanami: Consider it thanks for all the tasty cookies!\r\nKanami: You can have \"Eruption Angel Fabulous-san\"'s best friend, \"Thunderclap Angel Glamorous-sama\"!\r\nMai: Ahaha, you don't need to thank me. But if you really want me to, I'll take it.\r\nKanami: Yeah! Take good care of her!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Worry Consultation\r\n\r\nKanami: Sigh......\r\nMorishita Kihiro: Whoa there, unfamiliar toji! Something troubling you?\r\nKanami: Uwaah!? W-Where'd you come from!?\r\nKihiro: Allow me to introduce myself! From Ayanokouji Martial Arts School's Equipment Department, Morishita Kihiro, at your service!\r\nKihiro: Want to get stronger? Want to get faster? I'll solve whatever's got you down~!\r\nKanami: ...... Um...... I'll be fine.\r\nKihiro: What!? What's with that reaction, like I'm some sort of suspicious salesman!?\r\nKihiro: Did my sudden appearance startle you that much!? Or, don't tell me, there's a toji out there who doesn't want to get stronger!?\r\nKanami: ! ......\r\nKihiro: ...Was I actually right?\r\nKanami: No way! Of course I want to get stronger! I want to keep improving, but...\r\nKihiro: Can't quite express it, huh~? Well how about sharing your thoughts with a passing stranger such as myself?\r\nKihiro: If it's something serious, don't think you some complicated reason to tell us in the Equipment Department.\r\nKanami: ...I really love swordfighting. I love it so much that I just want to keep fighting all kinds of people and seeing all kinds of techniques.\r\nKanami: When I'm in a match, it feels like it would be a waste to let it end. So I find myself holding back sometimes to let it last longer. It's not like I mean to of course, but it just happens by accident.\r\nKanami: But if my opponent is trying so hard and I'm not...\r\nKanami: Isn't that really disrespectful? It's been bothering me.\r\nKanami: That's why, I want to get stronger... But I can't bring myself to ask for it.\r\nKihiro: Hmm, hmm~. I see, I see~.\r\nKihiro: However! If you had to ask if you'd fooled or disrespected anyone, my answer's a big NO!\r\nKihiro: Holding back is simply one of the many options a fight gives you.\r\nKihiro: It's only natural for the strong to have options! And the weak are of course limited in what they can do.\r\nKihiro: Giving you those options is the reason why we developers work alongside you toji fellows day after day.\r\nKihiro: Rather! For you to reject me giving you such power, for you to limit your own options...\r\nKihiro: For you to deny all the efforts I've done for you, miss toji, is far more disrespectful!! ...At least, that's how I feel.\r\nKanami: ...An option? Huh... I never thought of it like that.\r\nKihiro: Then again, it's only my personal opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.\r\nKanami: ...Okay. I'm still not convinced, but... I feel a little less worried about it.\r\nKanami: I'm glad we talked. You weren't kidding when you said you'd solve whatever's got me down.\r\nKihiro: The pleasure's all mine.\r\nKihiro: So. Now that that's settled...\r\nKihiro: My friend and fellow, who's looking to broaden her options~! It just so happens I've developed some fresh new equipment! You'd like to test it out, wouldn't you!?\r\nKihiro: How lucky I am, to come across a willing guin... Rather, to have brought a poor toji lost like a zombie back to her senses.\r\nKihiro: Allow me to measure again and again your precision, your endurance, how it feels to wear, etc! For one as strong as you, I won't take no for an answer!!\r\nKihiro: Ah, on that note, I'd like you to try this legwear on. We're going to be rather relentless in testing your skills with jin'i, so do your best to hang in there!\r\nKanami: Y-You really are trying to sell me something!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Swordfighting Idiot in the Library\r\n\r\nKanami: Hmm...? Hmm......\r\nFukuda Sawano: Nice to see you hard at work. You seem very enthusiastic.\r\nKanami: Ah, the lord of the library... Er, wait, you're...\r\nSawano: My name is Fukuda Sawano. ...Is \"lord\" the nickname the underclassmen gave me?\r\nKanami: Ahaha, sorry... You're always in the library, Sawano-san, so...\r\nSawano: There aren't many who come here in the first place, so it's pretty strange, isn't it? I've seen you around a few times, though.\r\nSawano: Do you like reading books?\r\nKanami: No, well, if I had to say one way or the other, I'm pretty bad with them... But this is different!\r\nSawano: That's... Oh, I see, a manual of swordfighting techniques.\r\nKanami: Whenever I see something new in a match or around the dojo, I just can't help myself.\r\nKanami: So I come look it up in the library. There's lots of books on swordfighting in here, after all. It's really useful in showing me what I want to know!\r\nSawano: That's right, that's right! Minoseki's library has an extensive and wonderful collection!\r\nSawano: And yet, for it to be so deserted... It's such a waste of resources!\r\nSawano: That's why I'm so glad to see someone passionate like yourself making use of it!\r\nKanami: You really love the library, don't you? But I'm not as good at researching as someone like you, so it's a little difficult.\r\nKanami: Like now, it's hard finding specifics about the technique I'm looking for...\r\nSawano: Then how about I help you? Just wait here a moment. Let's see...\r\n\r\nSawano: How about this? An illustrated reference book on practicing techniques. You reminded me of this book just now.\r\nKanami: Ahh, it's in here, I didn't even know what its name was! You're so knowledgeable, Sawano-san!\r\nKanami: Wow...\r\nKanami: Hmm.........\r\nKanami: ...I get it, so that's why you move like that... And then......\r\nSawano: And, if you want to know more about its practical uses, this book will cover that. Also, this book here is fiction, but its portrayal of it is surprisingly faithful!\r\nSawano: This book is my personal recommendation though. It covers the history of the school from its creation, giving by far the most thorough explanation of their...\r\nKanami: ......Sawano-san, I'm sorry!\r\nSawano: Eh?\r\nKanami: Now that I've learned about it, my body's itching to try it! I'm going to go practice in the simulator!\r\n\r\n--The next day.\r\nSawano: Ah.\r\nKanami: Sawano-san! H-Hello.\r\nSawano: Fufufu. You never came back yesterday.\r\nKanami: I got carried away... I stayed in the simulator until they ran out of defenders.\r\nKanami: Sorry. I know you picked out all those books for me...\r\nSawano: No, I'm the one who got carried away. I pushed too much on you...\r\nSawano: Mm! Have you heard this saying? \"Knowledge has no value until put into practice.\"\r\nSawano: By immediately applying the knowledge you've learned like that, that would make you a first class reader, in a sense.\r\nSawano: ...That's just second-hand knowledge, though.\r\nKanami: Ehehe, thank you. I'll come back if there's anything else I want to learn!\r\nSawano: Of course, I'd be happy to help anytime~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Test Score\r\n\r\nMihono: Kaaaanami-! How'd you do on the test?\r\nKanami: I tried pretty hard this time!\r\nMihono: Hehe, someone's confident! Meanwhile, Rika lied to me-.\r\nMihono: She kept crying about how she had a bad feeling, but then her score was as great as ever!\r\nSubara Rika: I wasn't lying~. I really thought I did terrible on this test.\r\nMihono: Ahh-! Ahh-! I don't wanna hear it-! I only talk to people on my level~!\r\nMihono: Like, let's see what Kanami got... Wait...\r\nMihono: Huhhh!? What the!?\r\nKanami: Ehh!? Did I really do that bad?\r\nMihono: No, it's just... Isn't this totally the average!?\r\nMihono: Teachers always get mad at you for not paying attention, so I figured you didn't study at all...\r\nKanami: I said I tried really hard this time!\r\nKanami: After all, after my grades were so low last time, Mai-chan said she'd help me study all I wanted whenever I wanted!\r\nRika: That sounds like what it'd take to get Kanami to study.\r\nMihono: Yeah, that's Kanami for you...! But it's too much for you to become a better student!\r\nMihono: You're already so good at fighting, so you have to have a weakness!\r\nRika: I'm not a fighter myself, so I don't really know how good she is there, but...\r\nRika: It's funny. I never would have thought Kanami-chan would be the type that's good at everything.\r\nRika: Didn't you say you could cook too?\r\nMihono: No way!?\r\nKanami: Well, you know, it's just my dad, my brother, and I. So with the way we organize household chores, I always had to take care of cooking.\r\nMihono: I always thought we were in this together... I never thought you'd be so good at everything on top of swordfighting...\r\nRika: From that reaction, Mihono-chan must be bad at cooking too.\r\nKanami: Ah, but I did screw up my cooking recently!\r\nKanami: I put out a pot to boil for 5 minutes and thought I could fit in some mental training, but...\r\nKanami: Next thing I knew the stove was almost on fire! I gotta remember not to think about swordfighting when I'm cooking~.\r\nRika: Of course it had something to do with swordfighting. Kanami-chan's obsessed with it, after all.\r\nMihono: So if I don't get at least that obsessed, I'll never beat Kanami...\r\nMihono: Rika, to be like Kanami, I'm going to have to focus more and more on swordfighting! If there's a will... There's a way!\r\nRika: Mihono-chan... Looking at your score, shouldn't you put that effort into studying?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/bXYlq8dSvxI\r\n[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start]: Master's Teachings\r\n\r\n--A while before the tournament took place.\r\n\r\nFukuda Sawano: You want a serious match... Against me?\r\nKanami: Yes! If you don't mind!\r\nMai: Kanami-chan! Don't go asking one of our senpai something like that out of nowhere! It's rude!\r\nKanami: Sorry about that, Mai-chan. But, I just want to see how all kinds of different people fight.\r\nSawano: I'm alright with fighting you, but... As you know, I'm only the \"Lord of the Library\".\r\nKanami: Ahaha, sorry about when I called you that...\r\nKanami: But actually, after that, I heard you were a very reliable fighter, so I wanted to try facing off with you at least once!\r\nSawano: ...I understand. Show me the skills of someone who's spent more time in books than anyone.\r\nKanami: Yesss! Thank you very much!\r\nMai: Kanami-chan's spent more time in books than anyone...?\r\nKanami: I'll explain that later! Mai-chan, please be our referee!\r\nMai: O-Okay... Then, begin!\r\nKanami: ...\r\nSawano: (She isn't launching an attack...? In that case, I'll go to her!)\r\nSawano: HAA!\r\nKanami: ...\r\nSawano: (Eh!? She vanished!?)\r\nSawano: (Behind me!? In a split second!?)\r\nKanami: YAAAA-!\r\nSawano: Kh... HAAAAA!\r\n\r\n--That night, in Kanami's dreams.\r\n\r\nMinato: Hmm... So? How'd the match turn out?\r\nKanami: I ended up winning.\r\nMinato: Hey, that's great!\r\nKanami: ...\r\nMinato: What's wrong? You don't look too happy about it?\r\nKanami: No, I'm pretty happy I won. It's just, I wanted to keep fighting on and on...\r\nMinato: You're saying you didn't even get to hit your stride? Now you're getting cocky about it.\r\nKanami: It's not like that!\r\nKanami: I want to fight more and more, so I can be like you.\r\nMinato: You're starting all these matches to be more like me?\r\nKanami: That's because, you aren't there in the real world... If you were there, then I wouldn't have to.\r\nMinato: That sounds like it'd be a real waste. You're finally getting to fight people besides me.\r\nKanami: It'd be a waste?\r\nMinato: Each and every fight means you get more people to \"Look close! Listen well! Focus on your senses!\" with.\r\nKanami: And that's...\r\nMinato: If you keep that in mind, you could learn even more than you already are, okay?\r\nKanami: Look close, listen well, focus on your senses... Okay! Thanks, Master!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End]: The Essentials of Swordsmanship\r\n\r\nMai: Eh? You want to have a serious match with me?\r\nKanami: Yeah! Please, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: You know I don't mind, but, where is this coming from?\r\nKanami: We always practice together, but I hardly know anything about you. So I was thinking, we could get to know each other better like this.\r\nMai: You want to know more about me...?\r\nKanami: Ehehe, sorry for asking you something so weird out of nowhere. When I woke up this morning, I just had this on my mind.\r\nMai: I don't quite understand, but... Alright. And if you're that eager about it, then I'm going to come at you with all I've got!\r\nKanami: Thanks, Mai-chan! Then, let's get started!\r\n\r\nMai: (Here she comes...!)\r\nKanami: (Stare...)\r\nMai: (Wait? Kanami-chan is acting differently than usual...?)\r\nMai: (But, if that's the case, I might be able to fight against her...!)\r\nKanami: (Ah, Mai-chan's stance changed. Woww, the way she's angling her sword is beautiful. It looks flexible at a glance, but I can tell she's holding it firm from her center.)\r\nKanami: (Oh, she closed the distance between us just a little bit! I get it... She's looking to see how I'll react. Then, if I move like this...)\r\nMai: (Kanami-chan lowered her body...! Is she preparing to charge? Then, I'll...)\r\nKanami: (Mai-chan took in a deep breath...! Maybe she's looking to set up a counter? But, in that stance, what would it look like...?)\r\nKanami: (Mmmm, I can't picture it at all... But... In that case, I just have to see for myself!)\r\nMai: (There it is! Kanami-chan moves so fast! But, I should be able to--)\r\nMai: YAAAA!\r\n\r\nMai: Aww, I lost... You're too tough for me after all, Kanami-chan...\r\nKanami: No way, you were great too, Mai-chan! When you came rushing out back there, I wasn't expecting it at all!\r\nKanami: That was Hokushin Itto-Ryu's \"Kiri-otoshi\", right?\r\nMai: Yep, you got it.\r\nKanami: I knew it! Please, Mai-chan! Show it to me again!\r\nMai: Fufu, I guess I don't have a choice.\r\nKanami: Awesome-!\r\nKanami: And, after that, I want to try using your move myself, so will you have another match with me too?\r\nKanami: Please! I'm begging you!\r\nMai: Then, on the other hand, I'll try moving like you did, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: You're the best, Mai-chan-!\r\nKanami: (Look close. Listen well. Focus on your senses.)\r\nKanami: (Just by keeping that in mind, swordfighting gets so much more interesting...!)\r\nKanami: (But, why did I suddenly think to try doing that? I feel like someone told me about it, but...)\r\nKanami: (Well, whoever they are, I've got to thank them someday!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/eNoknnmG1eI\r\n[Swimsuit 19: Start]: Please, Mai-chan!\r\n\r\nKanami: Let's go to the pool together, Mai-chan!\r\nKanami: You know about our next day off...? Well, it sounds like everybody else doesn't have to do any missions then either!\r\nMai: That's a real stroke of luck!\r\nKanami: I know! I couldn't believe it either.\r\nKanami: So, I was thinking, I want to go to the pool with everybody that day... Do you have any other plans then, Mai-chan?\r\nMai: Nope, I'm free to go. I'll look forward to it.\r\nKanami: Yeah!\r\n\r\nKanami: We're almost at the pool!\r\nMai: We're probably the only ones arriving here this early... Aren't we?\r\nMai: It's a little unfortunate everyone couldn't all make it at the same time.\r\nKanami: But still, everyone will be here by the afternoon... And Yui-chan and Tsugumi-san should get here soon!\r\nKanami: While we wait for them, let's have some fun together!\r\nMai: Sure!\r\nKanami: Though, what can we do with the two of us?\r\nKanami: I'd be alright with just swimming, but... With two of us, it'd definitely turn into a competition.\r\nMai: And also, that wouldn't be any different from PE class.\r\nKanami: That's true... Then, what about something like, going against the current in the river pool? Yeah! That could be a great full body exercise!\r\nMai: Aren't you just looking to do more training, Kanami-chan!? Didn't we come here to enjoy ourselves today?\r\nKanami: Ah... That's just where my mind started going to... Sorry, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: It's nothing to apologize over. It's very like you, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: Come up with something good for me, please!\r\nMai: Fufu, I'll give it a shot!\r\nMai: Let's see, something fun that's not connected to training... Ah!\r\nMai: Kanami-chan, let's go down a water slide!\r\nKanami: We're starting off with a water slide!?\r\nMai: Yep!\r\nMai: I don't think many people will be on those this time of day, so we should be able to get right to the front of the line!\r\nKanami: Oh yeah! Good thinking, Mai-chan!\r\nKanami: Alright! As soon as we get to the pool, we'll go down a water slide!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Swimsuit 19: End]: A Heartpounding Water Slide!?\r\n\r\nAttendant: Okay, the next person can come on up-. Are the two of you riding together? Or will you go separately?\r\nKanami: Oh, we can ride down together.\r\nKanami: What should we do, Mai-chan?\r\nMai: Hmm... Since we have the chance, why don't we go together?\r\nKanami: Sounds good!\r\nAttendant: You'll be riding together then-. In that case, please climb on board this rubber boat-.\r\nMai: ...!!\r\nMai: The boat is a lot smaller than I was expecting... We might have to be right up against each other.\r\nKanami: You think so? I guess it's like this?\r\nKanami: Here, I'll ride up front!\r\nMai: A-Alright... And, do I have to sit here...?\r\nKanami: If you don't sit there, how are you going to ride it down? Come on, get on!\r\nMai: Y-You're right... Mm, I won't be able to ride it otherwise... Mm.\r\nMai: ...I'm getting on then.\r\nAttendant: Excuse me-, could the two of you get a bit closer together-?\r\nMai: We need to be even closer!?\r\nKanami: Sure thing-.

We're moving really fast!! Ah, I saw Yui-chan over that way!\r\nMai: Eh, where at? Oh, Tsugumi-san is with her too!\r\nMai: This feels like you could use it to train your kinetic vision, huh, Kanami-chan!\r\nKanami: Hey, you're starting to sound like me now!?\r\n\r\nKanami: Ahh... That was so fun!\r\nKanami: Let's go again, and bring Yui-chan and Tsugumi-san along! This time, you can sit in front, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: Alright!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/JHZISRWAzhM\r\n[Railgun - Kanami: Start]: The Mysterious Use of the Remote\r\n\r\nOne day, Kanami was having tea with Mikoto and the rest.\r\n\r\nKanami: Are you used to living here yet?\r\nKuroko: Yes, entirely. Though, the one thing I'm still not used to is sleeping apart from Onee-sama.\r\nMai: You two sure are close, aren't you. Misaka-san and Shirai-san.\r\nMikoto: Just so you don't get the wrong idea, we only sleep in the same dorm room together... It's not like we sleep in the same bed.\r\nKanami: It's okay, we get it.\r\nMikoto: And also, I'm used to living here too. You do a lot for us. And just having to shoot aradama with electricity is easy for me.\r\nKanami: I'm glad to hear it. What about you, Shokuhou-san? Is anything bothering you?\r\nMisaki: I'm doing just fine too. It's pretty fresh, this lifestyle over heree.\r\n--[clatter]\r\nKanami: Shokuhou-san, you dropped something just now. ...Is this a remote?\r\nMisaki: Thank youu, Etou-san.\r\nKanami: Why are you carrying a remote around with you?\r\nMisaki: Hmm, why exactlyy? Why do you think that is, Etou-san?\r\nKanami: If you ask me, I think you can leave a remote in whichever room it belongs.\r\nKanami: Maybe if you have to lend a remote to somebody, but I've never had to. What about you, Mai?\r\nMai: There was one time Kanami-chan has said she couldn't find her remote, so I brought mine over to her room, but I think that's about it?\r\nKanami: Ahaha... My room was a real mess then.\r\nKanami: Ah, I know! You didn't have a remote, and, when you were on your way home from buying one, you went to see Misaka-san's experiment!\r\nMisaki: If that were the case, would you just happen to be carrying one with you?\r\nMai: Thinking about it normally, I can't imagine why you'd carry one around, so does it have something to do with your power after all, Shokuhou-san?\r\nMisaki: Well, maybee.\r\nMisaki: I haven't felt like using my power in this world, but, by force of habit, I end up bringing it with mee.\r\nYume: I really wanna know what kind of power you're hiding-!\r\nMisaki: Then, how about you try guessing what it is? If you get it right, I'll let you knoww. But, each person only gets one guess.\r\nMisaki: And, Misaka-san, Shirai-san, giving them hints is off limits, understood?\r\nMikoto: I get it.\r\nKuroko: This is another form of recreation. I wouldn't do something so rude.\r\nKanami: So you two really do know after all.\r\nKuroko: Anyone in Academy City, whether or not they were aware of the full details, would have heard of just what power a level 5 like Shokuhou Misaki has.\r\nKanami: I guess that makes sense, since she has a strong power. But still, what kind of power could it be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Railgun - Kanami: End]: It Could Be That Kind of Power!\r\n\r\nYume: A power that uses a TV remote, huh-.\r\nKanami: Remotes turn things on and off and can change the channels, but does that have anything to do with it?\r\nYume: Hmm~...\r\nYume: Ah, I got it! It's a power to make machines do whatever you want!\r\nMisaki: Bzzt-. Tsubakuro-san, that's wrongg.\r\nYume: Ehh-, but I was sure that was it-!\r\nMai: I was thinking something like that too, but I guess not. Then, is it a power that can send a sort of message to people far away? Like telepathy.\r\nMisaki: You were closee, but Yanase-san got it wrong too.\r\nMai: I thought it might send some sort of signal, but it's hard to narrow down, isn't it.\r\nMisaki: You're the only one left, Etou-san.\r\nMai: Give it your best shot, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: My answer is, simply-- A beam!\r\nYume: Huh?\r\nMai: Kanami-chan?\r\nMikoto: ...A beam? What made you think that??\r\nKanami: I was thinking, instead of a signal coming out the end of the remote to turn things off and on, it could shoot out a beam like, \"Bibibibi-!\"\r\nKanami: Kind of like, like this!\r\n\r\nMisaki: Fufufu, Etou-san. Now that you've learned the secret of my power, I won't be letting you off so easy~.\r\nMisaki: Take thiis, bibibibibibi-!\r\nKanami: Wahh! Save me, Shirai-san!\r\nKuroko: This way! Etou-san!\r\nMisaki: I can shoot a beam with lots of different effects, so you can't escape my beams~.\r\nMisaki: Take this, and that! Ahahahaha!\r\n\r\nKanami: And basically, Shokuhou-san's power is to control a beam that changes depending on the buttons she pushes!\r\nYume: Kanami-onee-san, that whole thing you acted out... What was that?\r\nKuroko: And also, why did I appear in this fantasy of yours?\r\nKanami: I mean, it just felt right for a battle between people with superpowers, so it popped in my head. Anyway, did I get it right?\r\nMisaki: Nope, my power isn't like that.\r\nMisaki: If I did have a beamm, I'd have helped you defeat the aradama a little.\r\nKanami: I guess that's true.\r\nMikoto: You think? If you had a power like that, even if you tried to help out, you'd be so out of shape you'd just slow us down for sure.\r\nMisaki: Sighh... Why don't we ignore Misaka-san, who cant go through a tiny hypothetical without showing her powers of rudeness, and have some more tea?\r\nKanami: More tea sounds good, but let's have it with Misaka-san too!\r\nMisaki: If we mustt. As a prize just for trying, I'll allow Misaka-san to join us.\r\nMikoto: Don't treat me like a consolation prize just because I was right.\r\nMai: Do these two maybe get along after all...\r\nKanami: That's what it seems like.\r\nKanami: But still, what's that remote for anyway?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/bUqlN1QeE1o\r\n[Stage Girl - Kanami: Start]: Somebody I Want to Spar With!\r\n\r\nMaya: Now then, I'll have you leave the stage. --HAAH!\r\n\r\nKaren: YAH!\r\nKaren: Nice! I beat it-.\r\n\r\nAradama: GUGGGIIIII!\r\nHikari: You won't get away-- This will finish it!\r\n\r\nKanami: These stage girls, they're all so amazing, aren't they! They fight differently from a toji, but I'm enjoying myself just watching them go!\r\nYui: Ahh... You can't help but be captivated by them, can you~.\r\nYui: Would you call it their posturing? Every one of the motions they go through grabs hold tight of my heart... It's so good!\r\nKanami: Yeah, I know just what you mean! Ahh, even if only for a little bit, I want to spar with all the stage girls!\r\nKaren: Kanami-chan, Kanami-chan, what's \"spar\" mean?\r\nKanami: Ah, sparring is when you face off... It's a practice match!\r\nKaren: A practice match, huh~. I think I might wanna have one too!\r\nFutaba: It'd be useful reference material for sword fights on stage, wouldn't it.\r\nKaoruko: Sure would. Though, I'm not about to join you.\r\nKanami: Sure! You only have to join in if you want to! I don't think it's good to force training in.\r\n\r\nHikari Slipping through my firmly raised hands, the vow we made that day fell into the abyss. I once again climb towards my stage of destiny. Even if it must end in tragedy... 99th generation, Kagura Hikari. It is all for the sake of Starlight!\r\nKanami: Wow-, being able to recite a line like that so smoothly; people training to be pros sure are something else.\r\nHikari: I am a stage girl, so this much is natural.\r\nKanami: Even still, it's pretty amazing.\r\nKanami: Oh yeah, thanks, Hikari-chan.\r\nHikari: What? Why are you thanking me suddenly?\r\nKanami: For sparring with me. I'm really happy you agreed!\r\nHikari: I just thought this experience might be useful on the stage. Are you ready?\r\nKanami: I'm ready to go anytime!\r\nHikari: Then... --YAH!\r\nKanami: That was a nice thrust, Hikari-chan! Now I'll go! HAAH!\r\nHikari: ...Kh! Then, I'll--!\r\nHikari: ...You're watching my movements closely.\r\nKanami: That's good! Show me more and more, Hikari-chan, of the way that you fight!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Stage Girl - Kanami: End]: It Is All for the Sake of Starlight!\r\n\r\nHikari: ...There-!\r\nKanami: !? That was a little risky just now!\r\nKanami: You're using the spring in your body to get even sharper with your strikes! That was a great thrust!\r\nHikari: ...You were able to dodge that just now? Toji really do have great physical performance.\r\nKanami: It's important to be able to avoid taking hits in battle, after all. That's a part of training too.\r\nHikari: Then, what will you do if I do this?\r\nKanami: Eh!? You threw your weapon!?\r\nHikari: Thank you. You deflected it just how I wanted you to.\r\nKanami: Wawah!? ...She's flying with a wire!?\r\nHikari: And now--!!\r\n\r\nKanami: Seeing that attack just now you did with the wire sent a chill up my spine-. You were right up in front of me all of a sudden.\r\nKanami: So you can fight like that too, huh!\r\nHikari: ...You blocked it so easily though.\r\nKanami: I mean, if I didn't block that right, I'd be done for. It wasn't easy for me at all.\r\nHikari: There's something I want to ask you... Why did you decide to have a match with me?\r\nKanami: Because I saw you not even flinching as you were fighting aradama, I guess.\r\nHikari: That should be the same for the other stage girls too. We all want the auditions to resume soon.\r\nKanami: You're right, but you were still a little different after all. I think it would be scary to fight with that short sword-like dagger, Hikari-chan.\r\nKanami: But still, you have a strong determination to fight. That's the feeling I got. So that's why I wanted to spar with you.\r\nHikari: ......\r\nKanami: And once we got down to it, it was super exciting!\r\nKanami: Ah! I wish I could try moving around with wires like you did, Hikari-chan-.\r\nHikari: You can't; I won't give it to you.\r\nKanami: I can't-? That's a bit of a shame!\r\nKanami: Hey. Hikari-chan, what did you think of sparring with me?\r\nHikari: Hm, real swordfighting was incredible. Teach me. Even if it's only the basic movements.\r\nKanami: Sure thing! I'll welcome anybody interested in swordfighting with open arms! We'll start with your stance, okay?\r\nHikari: This kind of seems like it could take a while... But, I'll be in your care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/KlIqfSZ3Cl8\r\n[Valkyrie - Kanami: Start]: Let's Do a Survey\r\n\r\nKanami: Promotional photos?\r\nMai: Yep, promotional photos.\r\nMai: They say it's to extend the scope of activities for those who were chosen in the Miss Five Traditions contest, so we'll all be taking them.\r\nKaoru: What a pain-.\r\nKaoru: They could just use the photos on our IDs for that.\r\nSayaka: Would ID photos work?\r\nMai: ...That definitely wouldn't work, would it?\r\nMai: And, about that, I have a photo studio I'd prefer to use, so could we all take our pictures there?\r\nHiyori: Sure, that sounds nice.\r\nEllen: Wait just a moment----!!\r\nKaoru: ...Where'd you even come from.\r\nEllen: I heard the whole thing!\r\nSayaka: Were you eavesdropping?\r\nEllen: You're making me sound bad, Saaya!\r\nEllen: And anyway, since you have this chance to take promotional photos, it wouldn't be any fun to take any everyday kind of picture!\r\nMai: This is a proper activity we were tasked to do, so isn't it fine if it's not fun?\r\nEllen: That's a no, Maimai!\r\nEllen: The mission of Miss Five Traditions was to help cheer up people across the world!\r\nEllen: Which means, we need to come up for something starting with this photo shoot!\r\nKanami: You know... I think Ellen-chan might be right!\r\nHiyori: ...Are you really okay with this?\r\nKaoru: Don't get won over by her smooth talking. She's just here to amuse herself.\r\nKanami: That's still fine! I don't think what Ellen-chan's saying is wrong.\r\nEllen: I knew I could count on you, Kanamin!\r\nEllen: So then... Let's start right off with a survey over the internet!\r\nEllen: Kanamin's promotional shots will be her in... These!\r\nEllen: An aradama hoodie, a Nenegurumi, or a valkyrie costume!\r\nKaoru: None of those are good for promotional shots!\r\nMai: But... They might look cute.\r\nSayaka: Mm, I want to see all of them.\r\nKanami: Y-You think so?\r\nKaoru: You guys... Don't come crying to me when it's your turn to put that on.\r\nHiyori: Me either.\r\nHiyori: Since I'll be having my photos taken at Mai's studio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Valkyrie - Kanami: End]: All in the Same Boat?\r\n\r\nEllen: We got the results back from Kanamin's survey!\r\nKanami: It's so tense...!\r\nEllen: They all put up a good fight, but... The winner in the end was the valkyrie costume!\r\nHiyori: ...Promotional photos of a valkyrie, huh.\r\nMai: Ellen-chan, leave making the costume to me! I'll make the perfect valkyrie costume to match Kanami-chan!\r\nEllen: Please do, Maimai! I'll be in charge of getting the scene ready!\r\nSayaka: Mai and Ellen are fired up...\r\nKaoru: ...Sigh.\r\nKaoru: So, what're we doing about you two, Sayaka and Mai?\r\nEllen: We haven't overlooked a thing! We're coming up with the greatest costume plans for all of you!\r\nKaoru: You're doing it for me too!?\r\nEllen: Well of course I am!\r\nKanami: (A valkyrie... I can't wait to see what the costume looks like!)\r\n\r\nKanami's promotional photos... The day of shooting.\r\n\r\nKanami: A-Am I... really going to wear this? It sure is revealing around the shoulders and places...\r\nHiyori: (...I told you so.)\r\nMai: I think it'll really look nice on you, Kanami-chan! I'm proud of how it turned out!\r\nKanami:  S-Sure... Ellen-chan?\r\nEllen: It's too late to change anything, Kanamin.\r\nEllen: The scene is all set too, and we already got approval from the Sword Administration Bureau!\r\nHiyori: That's why I warned you.\r\nKanami: I should've listened to you, Hiyori-chan...\r\nKaoru: It's alright, Kanami.

Thank you for going out of your way to stop by the lab today.\r\nKanami: What was it you wanted Sayaka-chan and me to do?\r\nTsugumi: I'm actually working with a new game utilizing the VR technology in development here in the lab... And, we were looking for play testers.\r\nKanami: A new game!? That sounds fun! Don't you want to try it, Sayaka-chan?\r\nSayaka: ...\r\nKanami: Sayaka-chan? What's wrong? You don't look too happy.\r\nSayaka: Tsugumi made that, didn't she... Kofuki said, \"Watch out with stuff she's made\"... Will it be alright?\r\nTsugumi: It's true that a lot has happened with Shichinosato-san... But you don't need to worry, Kitora-san is working with me this time.\r\nTsugumi: And we've proven it to be perfectly safe. We have provided a simple battle stage, but the primary goal of the game is to enjoy a virtual environment.\r\nKanami: Enjoy a virtual environment? Does that mean you can do things like fly around and make friends with the locals?\r\nTsugumi: That's right. We've put quite a lot of effort into the details on that end, so please look forward to it.\r\nTsugumi: If you befriend the townspeople, they can provide you with food and sweets, and invite you to parties... We've included fun features like that.\r\nKanami: Sounds fun! Sayaka-chan, I want to try it out!\r\nSayaka: Mm... But, I'm fine with sweets in the real world...\r\nTsugumi: Is that right. Incidentally, we've prepared a prize for the person that achieves the highest score in the game's battle stage.\r\nKanami: A prize!? What do we get?\r\nTsugumi: Kitora-san is out right now picking up cream puffs, but it seems she'll need to wait in line, as the store is fairly popular.\r\nSayaka: Creme puffs from a store with a line... Kanami. I'll try it.\r\nKanami: Nice-! Then, we'll be in your care, Tsugumi-san.\r\nTsugumi: Thank you for participating. Then, getting right to it, let's put on the equipment. And, I'll explain how to use it...\r\nKanami: It sure has a lot of features! It's giving me goosebumps. Alright, here I go-!\r\n\r\nKanami: Wow-- So cool! Is this seriously the world inside the game? It looks like a real city-!\r\nSayaka: Mm, the city at night... It's really beautiful...\r\nKanami: Wahh, look, look, Sayaka-chan! I'm flying in the air!\r\nSayaka: I'll try it too... That's amazing... I can fly...\r\nKanami: Give me your hand and we'll fly up to the top of that building!\r\nSayaka: Okay.\r\nKanami: Whoa-! We're flying between buildings like a couple of birds-! It's like I'm dreaming!\r\nSayaka: Mm... This is fun. Ah... Someone is waving their arm from a window...\r\nKanami: They are! Evening-! This is a really nice city you've got here-.\r\nSayaka: It looks like they're saying something. What do you think it is?\r\nKanami: Let's fly over next to the window then!\r\nKanami: Whoa! There's a bunch of tasty looking cakes on the inside. Eh? You're giving us these, to welcome us? Lucky us, Sayaka-chan.\r\nSayaka: Mm. Since we're here, we should try them.\r\nKanami: I wonder what cakes in virtual reality taste like. We'll take you up on that right away...\r\nKanami: Wait, that sound! Something's wrong with the city!\r\nSayaka: Is this the battle stage Tsugumi talked about? I'll try my best, for everyone in the city and for the cream puffs.\r\nKanami: Ughhh, that's right, but...

The townspeople who hid are coming back.\r\nSayaka: That's good... We protected the people in this world too.\r\nKanami: There's that person who was waving at us from the window earlier! Heyyy!\r\nTownsperson: Thank you very much for protecting our town. As thanks, we've prepared a feast for you, so please come with me.\r\nSayaka: A feast?\r\nKanami: Let's go, Sayaka-chan!\r\n\r\nSayaka: Amazing... There's an impressive feast...\r\nKanami: Is it really okay for us to have all this?\r\nTownsperson: Of course! You can have as much of the cakes you didn't get to eat earlier as you want too. Please, take your time.\r\nKanami: If you say so, then I won't hold back. Let's dig in-! [munch munch]... No way! This is as tasty as real cake!\r\nSayaka: It really is. ...It's sweet and delicious.\r\nKanami: Sayaka-chan, this steak and sushi here are good too! It's hard to believe this is actually part of a game!\r\nSayaka: Mm, it's really delicious... I feel like I could eat this forever.\r\nKanami: That's for sure. [chew chew] Mmmm, so good! Can I have seconds, please-!\r\n\r\nKanami: Phew~. My stomach's so full I can't eat another bite!\r\nSayaka: Me too. I feel full. I want to bring some back for Mai and everyone.\r\nKanami: Good idea! Excuse me-, could we get this cake to go?\r\nKanami: Hm? When that sound plays, does that mean the game's over? But the cake isn't boxed up yet-!\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Welcome back. How was the virtual world?\r\nKanami: Tsugumi-san, that game was too cool! It was sooo much fun, and the food was really tasty too!\r\nSayaka: We ate a lot, until we were full...... Hm?\r\nKanami: Sayaka-chan? What's wrong?\r\nSayaka: Even though I ate so much... I feel hungry...?\r\nKanami: That's so weird; me too! I was stuffing my mouth just a few minutes ago too-.\r\nTsugumi: Everything you experienced in there was virtual, after all. When you return here, you'll be in the state you were in before you started.\r\nSayaka: Is that why... It's strange, after I ate so much.\r\nKanami: Ah, come to think of it, can we have those cream puffs? Sayaka-chan worked really hard beating the enemies.\r\nTsugumi: Unfortunately, it seems that Kitora-san is still waiting in line. And also, those will only be given out as a prize to the top scorer after we get more people to play.\r\nKanami: Oh, huh-.\r\nMai: Sayaka-chan, Kanami-chan, there you are.\r\nKanami: Mai-chan! Why are you here?\r\nSayaka: [sniff sniff]... I smell Mai's cookies.\r\nMai: Fufufu, you got it right, Sayaka-chan. I baked some cookies and thought we could have them together, so I came to find you.\r\nKanami: Yay-, I'm glad to hear it! Who'd have thought Mai-chan would bring cookies at just the right time! I'll have some-!\r\nSayaka: I'm glad too. Mai, I'll have some. [munch much]... They're tasty!\r\nKanami: Yeah, yeah!

Seems like that'll be unlikely for a while.\r\nHiyori: But, assuming we could get a vacation, what would you want to do?\r\nKanami: Hmm... I'd want to go on a trip, I guess?\r\nHiyori: Going on a trip... That doesn't sound too bad. Would be nice to go to some hot springs and heal off all the daily fatigue.\r\nHiyori: Where do you want to go, Kanami?\r\nKanami: Hmm, let's see. I think I'd like to go on a trip overseas!\r\nKanami: Like, to the USA, for example. I'd want Ellen-chan to take me around to all the American dojos!\r\nHiyori: American dojos...? Well, that sounds like a trip you'd go on.\r\nKanami: I'll bet they feel different from the ones here in Japan, so it'll be fun for sure!\r\nHiyori: If you had Ellen with you, it'd probably get that much more noisy.\r\nKanami: And then, I'd want to go to the usual places, like Hawaii, and also, I think I'm interested in going to Europe too!\r\nHiyori: To see the dojos there too?\r\nKanami: Yeah! I want to check it out! Though, how much western style swordfighting do you think is still around in Europe?\r\nHiyori: As far as what level's still in practice... I'm not really sure.\r\nHiyori: Though, Europe refers to a big place. There's a lot of countries there, you know?\r\nHiyori: Was there any country you wanted to go visit in particular?\r\nKanami: Hmm, I guess I'd have to see England first?

Intruders!\r\nSuzuka: Hopping aboard the car we're guarding; you phantom thieves have run out of luck.\r\n\r\nHiyori: Wait, we're the thieves, not the detectives!?\r\nKanami: See, Hiyori-chan. Holmes is a master of Baritsu, right?\r\nKanami: So I'd want to fight him. Which means, we've gotta be phantom thieves!\r\nHiyori: \"Gotta be phantom thieves\"? Really!? And also, Holmes wasn't even there!\r\nKanami: Then maybe... Instead of working together, would it be a better setup if I came to steal you, Hiyori-chan?\r\nKanami: \"I've come to steal you away, Hiyori-chan!\" Like that.\r\nHiyori: Are you listening to me!? And anyway, you're the one kidnapping me!?\r\nKanami: Would you rather steal me?\r\nKanami: Like, \"I'm here to steal you away, Kanami.\"\r\nAnnouncement: We have confirmed the appearance of aradama. I repeat--\r\nHiyori: --!! Kanami, let's leave this off here!\r\nKanami: Yeah!\r\nHiyori: It's going to be a long time before we can think about that vacation.\r\nKanami: That's for sure. It's disappointing, but, we won't be able to vacation in peace until the aradama calm down some more.\r\nHiyori: I know.\r\nKanami: Once things settle down... Let's all go on a trip together.\r\nHiyori: When that time comes, I'll go with you wherever, to London or anywhere.\r\nHiyori:\u3000But let's get going, Kanami!\r\nKanami: Okay, Hiyori-chan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/SLmEfJhjktU\r\n[Halloween '19 - Kanami: Start]: Starting Halloween with Sweet Pie\r\n\r\nKanami: Mmm, Mai-chan's pumpkin pie is so good~!\r\nMai: I'm glad you like it, Kanami-chan.\r\nKanami: Did you bring this pie over to Sayaka-chan and them? She said she was filming a movie with Kitora-san, right?\r\nKanami: Apparently the director from that time with the period drama invited them.\r\nMai: Mm-mm, I thought I'd let Sayaka-chan have it after she gets back.\r\nMai: I can be careful, but it would be bad if the pie were damaged on the way.\r\nHiyori: That's probably for the best. Ohm... The sweets you make really are delicious, Mai.\r\nMai: Thank you, Hiyori-chan. If you'd like, let's make some together next time.\r\nHiyori: Alright. I've never made something like this before, but you teaching me would be a good chance to learn. I'll be counting on you.\r\nMai: Sure!\r\nYui: Ah, you three were in here!\r\nYui: Happy Halloween~! Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan, annnd, Mai-chan! Trick or treat~?\r\nMai: Here, Yui-chan, have a bite of this.\r\nYui: Oh! Did you make this, Mai-chan? I'll have some~. Mmm~, so good!\r\nKanami: Yui-chan, were you looking for us for something?\r\nYui: I'm passing the word on from Kiyoka-chan. The costume party we're having is going to be at an amusement park.\r\nYui: So, anybody who wants to get seriously dressed up, meet in an hour out in front of school!\r\nKanami: Ehh, that's so cool! Let's go, Hiyori-chan, Mai-chan!\r\nMai: We might as well.\r\nHiyori: So, when Kiyoka said we could rent our costumes, she meant from the amusement park?\r\nYui: I've got to make the rounds and let the other girls know, so I'll be seeing you later~.\r\nYui: And, if you see anybody, be sure to tell them too, okay~?\r\nKanami: We got it-. Thanks, Yui-chan!\r\nMai: How about we get going then?\r\nKanami: Ah, sure! Though, we still have some time left, so I want to have at least one more slice of pie~.\r\nMai: Of course you can.\r\nKanami: The sweets you make are just addictively good, Mai-chan! Makes me want to have some every single day! Anyway-- down the hatch-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Halloween '19 - Kanami: End]: Dressing Up Might be Fun!\r\n\r\nKanami: I can't wait to see what everyone's costumes are like.\r\nHiyori: Come to think of it, what's everybody else dressing up as? They said they had this and that.\r\nKanami: Ellen-chan said she'd be dressing up like a wolf, didn't she? Yui-chan, do you know? For Kiyoka-chan and everybody.\r\nYui: I told Kiyoka-chan she should dress up like a witch and little red riding hood, but she wouldn't wear those costumes in the end.\r\nHiyori: ...You gave her something weird to wear, didn't you?\r\nYui: Eh-- The skirt was just a liiittle bit short is all!?\r\nKanami: Ahaha... I'm pretty sure that's the reason.\r\nYui: But, I'd love to see Kiyoka-chan all dressed up in costume if I could. And Chie-san and Mihono-chan too, of course!\r\nKanami: I'm sure you would, Yui-chan. We should hurry over there then.\r\n\r\nKanami: Whoaa--! They're even letting us take photos up here-!\r\nKanami: C'mon Hiyori-chan, get a good look.\r\nHiyori: Yeah, it's a great view. I guess it's how they set it up, but it really looks like nighttime.\r\nKanami: They're probably trying to make it look more Halloween.\r\nHiyori: But, is this really alright? Us taking photos here.\r\nYui: Seems like it's fine. You can't see it from right here, but just under this there's a space and a fence to stop people from falling, just in case.\r\nKanami: Safety first, even when you're having fun.\r\nKanami: It'd be dangerous if little kids were jumping around, but a quick photo shoot should be fine.\r\nYui: So, Kanami-chan, strike a pose for me!\r\nKanami: A pose? How's this?\r\nYui: That's good, Kanami-chan, so good! It's got that... \"This world of night belongs to me--\" feeling!\r\nKanami: Ehehe... Getting dressed up and cosplaying might be kinda fun?\r\nKanami: Ah, Hiyori-chan. Since we're both vampires, how about we get our picture taken together?\r\nHiyori: Alright. Can we get in a little closer?\r\nKanami: That might be tricky.\r\nYui: What are you two saying? You're pairing up for a shot, so you've got to get right up on each other!\r\nYui: So close you're practically hugging!\r\nHiyori: Wha!?\r\nKanami: Like this?\r\nHiyori: ...Ka-Kanami!? Th-That's too close.\r\nYui: Niiice going, Kanami-chan~.\r\n\r\nHiyori: Doing this kind of thing is nice every now and then.\r\nKanami: Yeah. We should all go together for Halloween again next year!\r\nKanami: Ah, but before that, there's the cultural festival, Christmas, New Year's, Valentines. There's a lot of stuff that could be fun.\r\nHiyori: There sure is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/wCKVDULo_UY\r\n[Easter - Kanami: Start]: Attempting the Egg Hunt!\r\n\r\nEllen: Kanamin! Want to do an egg hunt with everyone, to celebrate Easter?\r\nKanami: An egg hunt? What's that?\r\nEllen: It's a fun event you do on Easter day. You hide colorful painted eggs in the park, and everyone competes to find them!\r\nKanami: That sounds fun! I knew you painted eggs for Easter, but I didn't know there was a game to look for them!\r\nEllen: For starters, the day before we do the egg hunt, do you want to make Easter eggs?\r\nKanami: Yeah, I want to try! I'll ask Hiyori-chan to come too!\r\n\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan wasn't in the classrooms or the dorms; I wonder where she went...\r\nEllen: Alright then, let's all get started making Easter eggs! Go ahead and draw nice designs on the eggs we have here!\r\nKanami: Huh? These eggs feel pretty light. What kind of eggs are they...? Wait, now that I look closer, there's a hole in the bottom and it's hollow inside! Ellen-chan, what'd you do with these eggs?\r\nEllen: We took out the insides earlier, with Saaya and Maimai helping me. It'd be a shame if any of the eggs broke halfway through.\r\nSayaka: It was a little hard to do... But it was fun.\r\nMai: Right now, Hiyori-chan is using the insides to cook for us. She'll be making a full course meal of egg related dishes for dinner tonight, so look forward to it.\r\nKanami: So Hiyori-chan was in the cooking room-? I wanted to make Easter eggs with her here though...\r\nEllen: I told her the same thing, but she said she's better at cooking than painting, so she wanted to be in charge of that...\r\nKanami: So that's why.\r\nEllen: It's too bad we don't have Hiyoyon with us, but let's go ahead and get right to painting the eggs! Here's pictures of examples for us to use.\r\nKanami: Wow, all the eggs look so cute and colorful!\r\nMai: There's a lot of bright, spring-feeling colors, so just looking over them feels exciting.\r\nSayaka: What do we do with these eggs after we finish painting them?\r\nEllen: We'll all go hide them in the park before tomorrow's egg hunt.\r\nMai: Though, with all these flashy designs, won't the eggs be found right away?\r\nEllen: There's plenty of colorful flowers in the park this time of spring, so they'll be harder to find than you think.\r\nKanami: Really? Then, I'll go with pink, and yellow, and greenish-yellow, and~!\r\nTsugumi: I thought it sounded lively in here. So you're all making Easter eggs?\r\nKanami: Tsugumi-san! Want to make some together with us?\r\nTsugumi: Thank you for asking. But I've already finished making my own custom made Easter eggs.\r\nTsugumi: I added something to them to make the egg hunt more exciting, so look forward to it.\r\nKanami: Ah, Tsugumi-saaan! ...She already left. I wonder what she did to them.\r\nSayaka: ...I wonder if it's okay...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Easter - Kanami: End]: In a Fervor! The Spring Egg Hunt\r\n\r\nEaster day.\r\n\r\nEllen: Did everyone get their outfits on right?\r\nKanami: Yep! These clothes are so cute it's getting me worked up.\r\nMai: I know; the pastel spring colors give them all that cute touch. Though, I never knew there were Easter events you dressed up for.\r\nSayaka: I didn't either.\r\nEllen: The costumes aren't a must, but fancy hats and spring-colored clothes are another way to enjoy Easter.\r\nEllen: Kiyoka, Fukki, and Yuiyui worked their hardest to make these.\r\nKanami: Wearing these neat clothes and looking for eggs makes me feel like I just stepped into a picture book!\r\nEllen: It's about time we got started, but, Hiyoyon isn't here, is she?\r\nKaoru: I haven't seen her all morning. She might've burned out making that full course of eggs yesterday.\r\nKanami: The food last night was incredible too. I guess I'll have to work extra hard for Hiyori-chan today! I'll find a whole bunch and come in first-!\r\n\r\nEllen: Everyone, the egg hunt is just about over! Did you get a lot of hunting done?\r\nMihono: Totally! That was so fun, like a treasure hunt-.\r\nHiyori: Yeah, the most important thing is everyone had fun doing it.\r\nMai: Huh? Hiyori-chan, I thought you were taking the day off to rest. You sure have a whole lot of eggs.\r\nHiyori: Well... I guess I do. So, who's the winner of this?\r\nEllen: When everyone gets back, we'll count the eggs and decide a winner; though, in the meantime, how about we tidy up?\r\nEllen: It'd be an issue if we left eggs here in the park, so please check over everywhere you hid them.\r\nKanami: Okaaay! Hiyori-chan, let's go look together.\r\nHiyori: Sure.\r\n\r\nKanami: It looks like people got to all the eggs that I hid. Maybe where I left them was a little too easy to find. ...Huh?\r\nHiyori: Nn? Did you find something, Kanami?\r\nKanami: There's a ton of ducks under that tree over there. I wonder why?\r\nHiyori: You're right, it's weird to see that many gathered around. But why... Ahhh! The ducks are flocking around easter eggs.\r\nTsugumi: They're all eggs that I left there. I spread them out across multiple locations, but in no time there were ducks gathered around each.\r\nKanami: Ehh? What, does that mean the ducks were joining in on the egg hunt?\r\nTsugumi: That's about right. Actually, in order to make this event more exciting, I thought, wouldn't it be fun if animals were to join in too?\r\nTsugumi: So I coated the insides of the egg with ingredients giving various scents that animals love. But... I had no idea ducks would be this persistent.\r\nHiyori: Well, now's not the time to get impressed with it. We can't leave things like this; we have to hurry up and get those eggs back.\r\nKanami: You're right, but we're going to have to be brave enough to jump into the middle of all them.\r\nTsugumi: I'm sorry about this... I know; I have a good idea. I'll attract the ducks here using the scents I coated the eggs with, so could you use that chance to get the eggs?\r\nHiyori: Alright, so you'll be the bait. Let's go with that.\r\nTsugumi: Come here duckies, over this way. You all love the smell of this...\r\nHiyori: Okay, the ducks went after Tsugumi. Kanami, get the eggs in the basket while you can!\r\nKanami: Yeah. Ummm, one, two, three... Okay, I got them all!\r\nKanami: Whoa, I got surrounded by ducks! Save me, Hiyori-chan-!\r\nHiyori: Mmgh, are you alright, Kanami? Pass the eggs in the basket over here.\r\nKanami: Wahh! That duck took one of the eggs! Give it back-!\r\nHiyori: Hey, don't bite my basket! There's no eggs in this one.\r\nTsugumi: I wonder what's causing that? The ducks seem to be more attracted to the scent on the eggs than what I originally coated them with...\r\nKanami: WAHH!! I got the egg back, but now the pack of ducks are after me-! Hiyori-chan, pass!\r\nHiyori: Hey, Kanami! Don't go throwing eggs! And now the ducks are coming my way.\r\nTsugumi: The egg hunt turned out far more exciting than I was expecting, from the looks of it.\r\nKanami: Don't go sounding proud about it now-! Help us, Tsugumi-san-!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/U1jobRU1Nr4\r\n[Summer Uniform 20 - Kanami: Start]: In Danger of Failing!?\r\n\r\nKanami: Help me, Hiyori-chan!

But it's still impossible.\r\nKanami: Stop being so mean~!\r\nHiyori: That's not what I meant. I meant it's impossible for me to teach someone.\r\nHiyori: The most I'll be able to tell you is to read the textbook and solve the example problems, alright?\r\nHiyori: What subject do you need help with, anyway?\r\nKanami: ...Math.\r\nHiyori: Just memorize the formulas and solve the problems.\r\nKanami: If I could do that, I wouldn't be asking you to teach me~!\r\nHiyori: Probably. But that's what I'm saying. Teaching is out of the question for me.\r\nKanami: ...I guess.\r\nHiyori: Why don't you get someone different to teach you? Like Ellen; aren't math and science her strong suits?\r\nKanami: Ellen-chan and Kaoru-chan are on missions too...\r\nHiyori: O-Oh...\r\nKanami: Sorry, Hiyori-chan, for asking too much from you. I'll study on my own...\r\nHiyori: ......Sigh, what can I do with you. Give me a minute.\r\nHiyori: Iwakura-san? This is Juujou... Do you have time right now?\r\nHiyori: Actually, there's a favor I need from you... I need your help on studying.\r\nHiyori: No, not with me. With Kanami. Yeah, from Minoseki... Right... Nn? That's... okay with you?\r\nHiyori: Ahh, so that's how it is. If that's the case, she'd actually be glad to go along with it.\r\nHiyori: ...Alright, thanks for the help.\r\nHiyori: ...Sigh.

You're from Heijou though, Iwakura-san...?\r\nMayumi: I'm the one who asked for her assistance!\r\nMayumi: Iwakura-senpai is talented when it comes to both studies and swordfighting! I said I won't be a bother, so I'd like to learn from every step she takes!\r\nSanae: And that's how it is... Would you mind, later on, joining Hasui-san and I in some training?\r\nKanami: If you're asking, I'd be happy to!\r\nSanae: Fufu, just like Juujou-san told me.

You're working hard.\r\nMihono: But the harder we work on missions, that just means we spend more time in makeup classes. I'm not really okay with that...!\r\nKanami: They could at least give us a little bit of a break!\r\nMai: I think, even now, they might still be taking into account the rate of missions you're sent on for your makeup classes. Especially since you two often get assigned to suppress aradama.\r\nKanami: Even still!?\r\nMihono: That's too much~...\r\nMai: Maybe you're right. But, if you score well on your tests, I think there's a chance you'd have less makeup classes?\r\nMai: If you two both try your best, I think you can get even better grades.\r\nKanami: Mmm... On tests, huh...\r\nMihono: ...I think I'd rather do makeup lessons.\r\nKanami: But, it feels good not having to do any more for a while. After sitting down for so long, I want to get some exercise.

They open starting at noon.\r\nKanami: At a place like that, Mai-chan'd be a huge help right away!\r\nMai: I don't think there's any way I'll be cooking or anything. I think we're only serving customers and other simple tasks.\r\nKanami: I guess you're right.\r\nKanami: Where are you supposed to be going, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: I'll be at a kindergarten.\r\nMai: A kindergarten teacher, hmm. That might be perfect for you, Mihono-chan.\r\nKanami: Right? I bet the kids'll love her.\r\nMihono: Eheheh. You think so?

I'm normally only being served, so I never considered it much, but serving customers was more work than I thought.\r\nMai: And it was all so new to me, so I was a bit nervous to start.\r\nKanami: It was tough, but the meals they gave us were so tasty.\r\nKanami: After eating that, I felt like I could keep going on and on.\r\nMai: Me too. I can see why customers kept coming in one after another. And also, their uniforms were very cute, with their Japanese taste.\r\nKanami: I know what you mean! Wearing something like that was so different, so it was a lot of fun putting it on.\r\nKanami: Though, maybe I only felt like that because I was working all day today.\r\nMai: Maybe so.\r\nKanami: Have you thought about ever owning a restaurant like that in the future, Mai-chan?\r\nMai: I'm honestly not sure if I want to try owning a restaurant, but I feel like I have to fight to make sure people working that hard every day can live their lives in peace.\r\nMai: Doing this made me reflect on that all over again.\r\nKanami: Good point. It's our duty as toji, after all.\r\nKanami: It's still a long ways away, but, when I have to stop being a toji, what should I do?\r\nMai: For you, Kanami-chan, what about teaching at a swordfighting dojo?\r\nKanami: I love swordfighting, so that could actually work!\r\nKanami: But, would I really be able to teach all that well?\r\nKanami: It feels like I could teach more if we actually go okatana against okatana, like when my mother was teaching me.\r\nMai: If you taught someone, I have a feeling they'd grow into a strong toji.\r\nKanami: And then, after they're strong, they can come back and fight their master! That'd be exciting!\r\nMai: So, once they got strong enough, you'd fight your own pupils after all.\r\nKanami: Of course I would!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/m5rpY-umfYk\r\n[Mahou Shoujo - Kanami: Start]: Were You Going Easy?\r\n\r\nSayaka: Are you ready?\r\nKanami: Sure, Sayaka-chan.\r\nFate: I'm ready to go too, Sayaka-san.\r\nSayaka: Then...

Sayaka-chan!\r\nSayaka: I'm ready whenever.\r\nFate: Is it aradama?\r\nKanami: Yeah. Sorry, Fate-chan.\r\nFate: ...I'd like to help out too. Would that be a problem?\r\nKanami: No, that'd be great!

Why is that?\r\nKanami: I was thinking, I might be able to take something away from how Fate-chan moves around.\r\nSayaka: Like what?\r\nKanami: What sets Fate-chan apart is her speed, right?\r\nKanami: So, if I could capture that with jin'i, I might be able to borrow what makes Fate-chan so good.\r\nSayaka: You're right, Kanami. I want to try learning from her too.\r\nSayaka: [stare]...\r\nKanami: [stare]...\r\nFate: Kanami-san? Sayaka-san?\r\nFate: We still haven't finished defeating all of them, so isn't it dangerous to be looking away from your opponent?\r\nKanami: Y-Yeah, that's true!

Why were the both of you watching me, Kanami-san, Sayaka-san?\r\nFate: It was a bit... embarrassing... \r\nKanami: Ahh, sorry about that, Fate-chan!\r\nKanami: I guess you could call it training by observing... We were wondering if we could take something from the way you move around.\r\nFate: So that's what it was.\r\nFate: Then, if learning from my movements is good enough for you... Go ahead.\r\nKanami: Hooray! \r\nKanami: Then, when we get back, I want to talk it all over! Actually, there's this move you did I was curious about!\r\nFate: E-Eh?\r\nSayaka: There's something I wanted to ask too.\r\nKanami: See, see!

I could really go for some ice cream...\r\nHiyori: ...If you're dying to eat it, I don't mind joining you.\r\nKanami: Mm... I don't think I'll die, so let's just pass.\r\nHiyori: Eh...\r\nKanami: Ahaha, just kidding! Let's go!\r\n\r\nKanami: By the way, do you like any flavors besides chocomint, Hiyori-chan?\r\nHiyori: I've never thought about it.\r\nKanami: Then, wanna taste some of what I'm ordering?\r\nKanami: Excuse me! I'll have a triple scoop with strawberry, cheesecake, and cream soda flavor!\r\nHiyori: I'll have a triple as well. Make all three chocolate mint.\r\nKanami: You always take it to the extremes... Here, Hiyori-chan. Try this.\r\nHiyori: Mm... This cream soda flavor is actually good.\r\nHiyori: Can I have some of the strawberry and cheesecake too?\r\nKanami: Go ahead.\r\nHiyori: This one, it's good too. Mixing cheesecake and ice cream sounded like heresy, but this is actually a real winner.\r\nKanami: I know, right?\r\nHiyori: ...By the way, Kanami. Why are you aiming your phone at me?\r\nKanami: Welll, you just looked so cute eating ice cream that I wanted to take a video of it.\r\nHiyori: --Huh!?\r\nKanami: When you smile like that, it looks like your face is melting.

I was re-reading my favorite book, but I can't remember where I left it...\r\nKiyoka: The only place I haven't looked yet... Is this classroom...\r\nKiyoka: Ah, someone's in there...\r\nKiyoka: (If I remember right, that's the third year, Juujou-senpai...? She always seems so hard to approach... I wonder what she's reading...)\r\nKiyoka: (Ahh! That's my book! Why is Juujou-senpai reading it though... Wh-What should I do...)\r\nKiyoka: (Actually, I want to know what she thinks of it... But it's no ordinary love story, so I'd be embarrassed if she kept reading...)\r\nKiyoka: (Two teenage girls share such a lovely bond, but they have to fight against the destiny their parents left them, and things start heating up... I really recommend it...!)\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nKiyoka: (S-So what does she think of it... I love that book so much, but... Ahh, if only I had a little more confidence...)\r\nKiyoka: (? Huh...?)\r\nHiyori: ......sniffle...\r\nKiyoka: (S-She's crying...! Juujou-senpai is crying...!?)\r\nHiyori: ! Who's there?\r\nKiyoka: Hya! S-S-S-S-Sorry! I didn't mean to spy on you...!\r\nKiyoka: I just came to get back the book I left behind...!\r\nHiyori: ...This is your book? Sorry for reading it.\r\nKiyoka: D-Don't worry about it! Do you like reading?\r\nHiyori: I don't normally read many books, but... This was interesting. I suddenly found myself getting sucked into it.\r\nKiyoka: Th-Then, I'll... I'll lend it to you! Please read it to the end!\r\nHiyori: No, I couldn't...\r\nKiyoka: I don't know any other girls who've read that book! I want to talk about it with someone! So please, read it!\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nKiyoka: Ah, sorry...! I'm imposing on you too much, aren't I...\r\nHiyori: If you insist, then I'll borrow it.\r\nKiyoka: ! Th-Thank you so much!\r\nHiyori: What's your name?\r\nKiyoka: I'm Musumi, in my second year. And you're Juujou-senpai, aren't you? You're participating in the upcoming tournament...\r\nHiyori: ...Right. I'll be sure to give this back to you before then.\r\nKiyoka: No, you don't have to rush yourself.\r\nHiyori: I'm in a hurry.\r\nKiyoka: ...?\r\nHiyori: ...After the tournament's over, I'd like it if you could recommend some books for me.\r\nKiyoka: S-Sure! I'd love to!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Hiyori's Long Held Desire\r\n\r\nBodyguard Toji: There they are! The ones who attacked the head of the family! Just make this easy and surrender!\r\nHiyori: Tch. They caught up to us.\r\nKanami: But if we just beat these guards, we should be able to get away!\r\nHiyori: ...Do you really plan on fighting beside me? You'll make yourself an enemy of everyone.\r\nKanami: I made up my mind to run away with you!\r\nHiyori: ...Then I hope you don't regret this.\r\n\r\nKanami: ...Phew. Since we've made it this far, we should be safe for a while.\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nKanami: Hm? What's wrong, Hiyori-chan? You keep staring at me.\r\nHiyori: ...No, it's nothing.\r\nKanami: Okay.\r\nHiyori: ...Why aren't you asking me any questions?\r\nKanami: ...I can tell there's a strong determination behind your sword. A desire that won't let up until you reach your goal.\r\nKanami: No matter what your reason is, I've made up my mind to help you. You can share the rest with me when you feel ready.\r\nHiyori: ...Oh.\r\nHiyori: ...Then I'll tell you why... The reason why I'm after Origami Yukari.\r\nKanami: Okay...\r\nHiyori: You know about the great aradama incident, \"The Great Disaster of Sagami Bay\", that happened 20 years ago, don't you?\r\nKanami: They said it's the worst aradama incident in history. Origami Yukari-sama led a special force of the current presidents of the Five Traditions into Enoshima to suppress it.\r\nHiyori: That's right.\r\nHiyori: But to say they suppressed it was a lie. Origami Yukari, who they called a hero...\r\nHiyori: Is nothing more than the great aradama they claimed to have destroyed.\r\nHiyori: The disaster that threatened the world. That despicable being. An utter stain on humanity. That's what she is.\r\nKanami: Huh...!?\r\nHiyori: My mother was one of the toji there at Enoshima. She should have had the power to destroy it, but she failed.\r\nHiyori: Now that aradama lives on, pretending to be Origami Yukari.\r\nHiyori: My mother's power as a toji faded, and I watched her waste away over the years. And, last year, as I stayed by her side, she passed on.\r\nHiyori: ...The night my mother died, I swore I would finish the duty she left undone.\r\nHiyori: ...Well? It's a heavy burden, isn't it?\r\nHiyori: Half of it is my responsibility as a toji... But half of it is my own revenge. That's why, there's no need for you to join me...\r\nKanami: You're right.\r\nHiyori: ...?\r\nKanami: I think it's too heavy for you.\r\nKanami: That's why, I'll help you carry some of it.\r\nHiyori: Kanami...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Juujou Hiyori's Chest Investigation\r\n\r\nHiyori: .........\r\nKanami: I wonder what's wrong with Hiyori-chan. She's been looking upset for a while now...\r\nSayaka: ...?\r\n\r\nHiyori: ...... \"Eternally flat chested woman\"...\r\nHiyori: No matter how I think about it, it seems like it has to be an insult...\r\nHiyori: But I'd never thought of there being some kind of value related to chest size before. Is it really that bad mine are this small...?\r\nHiyori: In the first place, Kaoru herself is older than me, but she doesn't seem any better...\r\nHiyori: Considering that, I don't think my flatness is too strange...\r\nHiyori: ...... .........!?\r\nHiyori: Ellen must be some kind of special case... The difference in size is too disturbing...\r\nHiyori: ...That's actually somewhat relieving. There's no way she can be considered the standard.\r\nHiyori: No... Wait, that reminds me...\r\nHiyori: I hadn't considered her until now, but Mai and Ellen together make a convincing argument...\r\nHiyori: And Mai is even younger than I am...\r\nHiyori: Is that it? Does this mean my chest should have been at least that size by now...!?\r\nHiyori: And... What rule defines how large they are to begin with...!?\r\nHiyori: What do Kaoru and I lack...\r\nHiyori: What do Ellen and Mai have...\r\nHiyori: ......Cheerfulness...? Kindness...?\r\nHiyori: Is their size a symbol representing the depths of a person's generosity...!?\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nHiyori: ! Kanami! That's right, I still have Kanami!\r\nHiyori: She's fairly cheery and considerate. Much more than Kaoru and I at least; more on Mai and Ellen's level!\r\nHiyori: But her chest...!\r\nHiyori: It seems like there's no relationship between chest size and human nature after all. Fufu... It's simply individual differences.\r\n\r\nKaoru: ......What's wrong with her?\r\nEllen: She's been staring hard at everyone's boobs. But her face suddenly lit up when she settled on Kanamin's!\r\nEllen: Hiyoyon really loves Kanamin, after all!\r\nKaoru: Boobs? ...Hehee. So that's what this is about.\r\nKaoru: Kukuku... You really are fun to mess with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Hiyori's Study Session\r\n\r\n*Kanami keeps leaning over into Hiyori*\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nMai: ......\r\nKanami: Hmhmm~~~~.\r\nHiyori: ...What? We aren't in the same grade. Watching me isn't going to help you on your test.\r\nKanami: No, it's just, your notes look so pretty, Hiyori-chan. I already knew about Mai-chan, but I didn't think you were so good at studying too...\r\nKanami: You're both such strong toji, so don't you think it's unfair you get good grades too?\r\nHiyori: Shut up. I bet you only think about swordfighting in the middle of lectures. You should pay more attention.\r\nKanami: Wait, how'd you know? Did you peek in one day!?\r\nHiyori: Sigh... We're getting sidetracked, so just forget it.\r\nHiyori: In the time we've wasted now, you could have finished at least one page. Work on catching up.\r\nKanami: Fiiine...\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nKanami: ......\r\nKanami: ...... (Peek).\r\nKanami: It's such a nice day outside too... Hey, Hiyori-chan, after this is over, want to have a practice bat-\r\nHiyori: ...Are you actually bored already? It hasn't even been a full minute.\r\nKanami: S-Sorry... I'll study.\r\nKanami: ......\r\nKanami: ......! ......~!\r\nHiyori: (She's finally quieted down. I started doubting her ability to concentrate, but it looks like she's resigned to take this seriously...)\r\nHiyori: Hey, what are you doodling in your textbook for!?\r\nKanami: Because, I feel like I could come up with a better method than the one they're teaching in here.\r\nKanami: See, look~ With the stance they're teaching, you lose awareness around here~ But... How about this!\r\nHiyori: The tactics in there have been tested countless times through history. You won't just come up with something better like that...\r\n*Hiyori leans over*\r\nHiyori: Hm? Actually... This might work too...\r\nKanami: Right!?\r\nHiyori: ...No, it wouldn't. See, in this situation, your opponent could then...\r\nKanami: Whoops, you're right... Ah, what about...\r\nHiyori: Rather than that, you could...\r\nHiyori: ......Ah!\r\nHiyori: Hey! Now you're getting me distracted too!!\r\nKanami: Calm down, Hiyori-chan. Even if you slack off here, you'll still get good grades.\t\r\nHiyori: What's with that condescending attitude!? In the first place, you're the one who asked me to help you study for your test!\r\nMai (who was here the whole time): Fufu... You're actually pretty good at taking care of people, aren't you, Hiyori-chan?\r\n*Hiyori leans over to Mai*\r\nHiyori: Hey, Mai! Isn't she your responsibility!? Don't laugh like it's my problem; help me out with her!\r\nMai: Hmmm, I don't know about that? Lately, it feels more and more like you're the one on Kanami-chan duty...\r\nMai: And I'm busy with my own studying too. Take good care of Kanami-chan for me, Hiyori-chan~.\r\nHiyori: M-Mai...? That smile of yours looks strangely forced... Are you mad about something...?\r\nMai: I'm not mad. Maybe just a little jealous.\r\nHiyori: Huh...!?\r\n*Kanami jumps up*\r\nKanami: Hey, Hiyori-chan! I just thought of a really good idea! Can we do a practice round to test it out?\r\nHiyori: You just get back to work!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkYpstF7b2U\r\n[Stage Girl: Start]: We'll Starlight!\r\n\r\nHiyori: HAAA!\r\nAradama: GYAAAA!\r\nKaren: (stare)...\r\nHiyori: Phew... Nn? What is it, Karen? Did you want something from me?\r\nKaren: Don't worry! I don't need anything, so just keep going like that!\r\nHiyori: You say that, but it's awkward with you watching me so closely...\r\nKaren: Ah, that makes sense! Then I'll just say what I'm thinking!\r\nKaren: Your swordsmanship is so pretty, Hiyori-chan!\r\nHiyori: Wh-What!?\r\nKaren: Your movements never waver, and the way you swing your sword, it feels so dignified!\r\nKaren: How did you learn to swing your sword so pretty?\r\nHiyori: How? All I can say is, I was dedicated to my training...\r\nKaren: Then it really is all about practice, huh. I was hoping you'd say there's some trick to it.\r\nKaren: Are there any, Hiyori-chan!?\r\nHiyori: Uh... Y-Your face is too close...\r\nHiyori: Kh... In that case, why don't I let you experience it firsthand?\r\nKaren: Firsthand?\r\nHiyori: Fight with me.\r\nHiyori: It'd be easier to understand that way than me trying to explain it to you.\r\n\r\nKaren: On a stage overflowing with stardust, a flower of love blooms gracefully.

Then, I'll give it all I've got!\r\nHiyori: I'm not about to go easy on you either!\r\nKaren: That would be a non non!\r\nKaren: With that settled...\r\nHiyori: Let's begin!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Stage Girl: End]: Don't Forget, Okay?\r\n\r\nHiyori: A staircase...?

Don't think you'll find an opening that easy!\r\nKaren: Whoa, you avoided that so easy!? Ahh, guess that won't work either.\r\nHiyori: Still... What's going on with this place? This strange stage we're on.\r\nKaren: What kind of stage do you want it to be, Hiyori-chan? If you think about it, I think it'll change.\r\nHiyori: For me? It's okay for me to change it too?\r\nKaren: Why wouldn't it be okay?\r\nHiyori: Hmm...\r\nKaren: ...Now's my chance! You're wide open!\r\nHiyori: No I was not! ...Still, I might as well try this out now.\r\nKaren: Chocolate mint!?\r\nHiyori: I don't believe it... It actually appeared.\r\nKaren: You like chocolate mint, Hiyori-chan? That's good for when you have to brush your teeth, huh!\r\nHiyori: I don't need it for that!\r\nKaren: Wah!? Wawawa!!\r\nHiyori: Stop dodging! Didn't you want to experience my swordsmanship!?\r\nKaren: Easy for you to say, but... Wawa!? I-I've gotta strike back... YAH!\r\nHiyori: Too slow!\r\nKaren: Uwah!?\r\nKaren: I seriously can't hit you at all!\r\nHiyori: Why do you look happy about that?\r\nKaren: Cause I get to see your pretty swordfighting up close! I'm learning a whole lot!\r\nHiyori: It's about time you showed what you're learning then.\r\nKaren: You're right... How about this!\r\nKaren: HAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nHiyori: -!? That movement, that's from when I...!\r\nKaren: Nice! I made you block me with your okatana!\r\nHiyori: Right, that attack wasn't too bad just now.\r\nKaren: Stage girls are evolving every day!  Let's do some more, Hiyori-chan!\r\n\r\nKaren: Thank you for fighting with me, Hiyori-chan! It was a whole lot of fun!\r\nHiyori: I normally have to keep someone far more persistent company, after all. I'm fine with being your opponent whenever you want.\r\nHiyori: And also, make sure not to forget the way you moved before, alright?\r\nKaren: Okay!

You really surprised me.\r\nHiyori: ...I guess. Did you want something?\r\nShiho: Ah, that's right.\r\nShiho: My skills with a sword are still nowhere near that good. So, if it's alright with you, I was wondering if you could teach me some things later?\r\nShiho: I mean, just if you have some free time.\r\nHiyori: ...Sorry, but there's something I have to do.\r\nShiho: Oh, okay...

That's a little disappointing.\r\nHiyori: As always... You act the same towards everyone when swordfighting is involved. Well, that's how you are.\r\nKanami: I mean, she can dual wield, can't she? Yukari-sama and Shichinosato-san can do it too, but it's not something you get to see all that often, is it?\r\nSonoko: Nibosshi, you get along with her without fighting, okay-? Also, here's 500 yen for snacks.\r\nKarin: Am I going on a field trip!? What if they think us Heroes can't take things seriously!\r\nSonoko: For your snacks-- Don't you think it would be best to re-energize with some sugar when you get a break? And also, Niboshi don't count as snacks, so don't worry about that~.\r\nKarin: Of course they don't. Niboshi form a complete diet.\r\nHiyori: (...Niboshi? Niboshi, huh.)\r\nHiyori: Anyway, we should leave.\r\nKarin: That's right, we won't get anything done waiting around here talking.\r\nKanami/Sonoko: Have a safe trip-!\r\n\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nKarin: .....\r\nHiyori: (At times like these, the sensible thing to do would be to find something to talk about, wouldn't it?)\r\nHiyori: (In that case... Alright.)\r\nHiyori: ...Hey.\r\nKarin: ...Hey.\r\nHiyori: Ah, oh. You can go ahead, Karin.\r\nKarin: I wasn't going to say anything important. You can say what you were going to first.\r\nHiyori: Alright.... Well, let's work together today. I've seen the way you fight, so I don't think we'll have anything to worry about.\r\nKarin: I made up my mind to help out, and I'll see it through. You can rely on me.\r\nKarin: It'll depend on how many aradama there are, but what if I soften them up, and you finish them off? That should be the most efficient course of action.\r\nHiyori: That should be fine. I was thinking of following the same plan once we got to the site.\r\nKarin: That's good then.\r\nHiyori: What were you about to say before?\r\nKarin: Would it be difficult to completely and fully eliminate all the aradama?\r\nKarin: There are people living in the town. And aradama appear there... No matter how you look at it, they're living right next door to danger.\r\nHiyori: If we could do that, that would be for the best. Though, unfortunately, we still haven't found an effective way of doing that.\r\nKarin: ...So if it were possible, you would have surely done it long ago. Sorry for asking something strange.\r\nHiyori: No, I don't mind.\r\nHiyori: You're a... You're a kind person, Karin. Without a second thought, you're worried for the people in our world too. Though, everyone in the Hero Club seems that way.\r\nKarin: I-Isn't that just normal...? That kind of attitude. All of you too, if you came to our world and had the strength to fight our enemies, you'd do it, wouldn't you?\r\nHiyori: That's true. I'd hope so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Yuusha 2: Hiyori: End]: Niboshi and Chocolate Mint\r\n\r\nKarin: TORYAAA-! --HAAH!\r\nAradama: AAAAaaaa...\r\nKarin: Now, Hiyori!\r\nHiyori: Right! --HAAAAHH!\r\nKarin: There don't seem to be any more aradama in sight for now, but what do you think?\r\nHiyori: Judging from the report, there should be a few more of them, but we don't seem likely to make contact with any more around here.\r\nHiyori: Why don't we move positions some while keeping on the alert.\r\nKarin: Alright. We should rehydrate now, while we have the opportunity.\r\nHiyori: Good idea. [gulp gulp]...\r\nKarin: I'll take some supplements too...\r\nHiyori: !?\r\nHiyori: (Just how many does she have!?)\r\nHiyori: ...Hey, why are you taking so many supplements?\r\nKarin: It's a part of keeping my body in healthy condition, of course. If I were getting sick often, I wouldn't be able to function as a Hero.\r\nHiyori: You have a point, but can't you get the nutrition you need from proper meals?\r\nKarin: ...I do eat proper meals too, whenever possible. [crunch crunch]...\r\nHiyori: ...And after supplements, you pull out niboshi.\r\nKarin: You see, niboshi doesn't just give you calcium, but also a whole host of vitamins, DPA, and EHA.\r\nKarin: And, since all the varieties of niboshi means you'll never get tired of it, it wouldn't be unreasonable to call it the perfect food.\r\nHiyori: You like niboshi, huh. So that's why they called you \"Nibosshi\".\r\nKarin: Sonoko's the only one who calls me that, okay...!\r\nKarin: Here, do you want some too?\r\nHiyori: I guess I'll have some. Prioritizing your health is just as important for a toji.\r\nHiyori: [crunch crunch]... These are good.\r\nKarin: Aren't they? I'm glad I got paired with someone who can understand the quality of niboshi.\r\nHiyori: I do like Japanese foods. I eat niboshi too, from time to time.\r\nKarin: What's your favorite food, Hiyori?\r\nHiyori: That would be nimono, and... Chocolate mint.\r\nKarin: You said you liked Japanese foods... I didn't expect to hear chocolate mint from you.\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nKarin: If you think up a type of chocolate mint you'd recommend, then let me know. I want to try it. Before I go back to our world.\r\nHiyori: ! Sure, you can look forward to it!\r\nHiyori: ...Sorry, I didn't mean to raise my voice just now.\r\nKarin: Hiyori... You love chocolate mint a lot, don't you.\r\nHiyori: I-I won't deny that. Anyway, let's go look for the rest of the aradama.\r\n\r\nKarin: This one is a bit bigger and more of a handful... But, with Hiyori and I, we can manage!\r\nHiyori: --This is the finish!\r\nKarin: Was that the last one?\r\nHiyori: Yeah. We finished suppressing the aradama sooner than scheduled. Thanks; it's because I had your help.\r\nKarin: It wasn't any trouble for me to come along.\r\n\r\nHiyori: This one's only chocolate mint flavor convenience store ice cream, but it's pretty good.\r\nKarin: I'll have some then. ...Nn!\r\nKarin: No wonder you recommended this; this is great.\r\nHiyori: That's good to hear... Sometimes, you get someone making senseless comments like \"chocolate mint is toothpaste\".\r\nKarin: Isn't that because toothpaste is just mint flavored, and not that chocolate mint tastes like toothpaste?\r\nHiyori: You got it, you really get it. It's such a relief you're one of the ones who understands, Karin.\r\nKarin: It's not that big a deal. Come on, we should head back soon.\r\nHiyori: That's true. I still have plenty more to recommend you. I'll give you the rest of them on the train.\r\nKarin: Hey... They aren't all chocolate mint, are they?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/FUwv5IZDyA4\r\n[Fantasy - Hiyori: Start]: Welcome to the World of Fantasy\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Thank you for participating in today's test of our new training simulation system, Juujou-san, Morishita-san.\r\nHiyori: I don't mind helping, but... Why is Morishita-san here? She's from the equipment department, isn't she?\r\nKihiro: That would be to seek out inspiration, Miss Juujou!\r\nHiyori: Miss Juujou...?\r\nKihiro: I may be a gen~ius, but constant output runs the well of my talents dry!\r\nKihiro: Sometimes I like to get myself in harm's way~!\r\nHiyori: I-Is that right...\r\nKihiro: Now then, Miss Juujou! Let's go on our grand adventure!\r\nTsugumi: Morishita-san, I hadn't finished explaining for Juujou-san yet.\r\nKihiro: Whoops, how rude of me! I was getting ahead of myself!\r\nHiyori: ...\r\nTsugumi: Juujou-san?\r\nHiyori: I-I'm fine. Just, getting a little overwhelmed by Morishita-san...\r\nTsugumi: Please keep up as best you can.\r\nTsugumi: This VR based combat training will be using a fantasy theme.\r\nHiyori: Fantasy?\r\nTsugumi: The enemies are still aradama, of course.\r\nTsugumi: Though, since we can make use of VR, there were requests for us to make it more fun to train in.\r\nKihiro: And so we're able to take a great journey across the world of fantasy~!\r\nHiyori: I got it. So long as I can still fight aradama like usual, there won't be an issue.\r\nKihiro: You're very reliable, Miss Juujou! I'll do all I can to support you too~!\r\nHiyori: Support me? What are you going to be doing in VR, Morishita-san?\r\nKihiro: The character I'm playing is a support type! I can use simple attack magic of course, but giving support from the rear is my specialty!\r\nKihiro: I'll give you just the support you need, Miss Juujou!\r\nHiyori: Y-You will then...\r\nTsugumi: With that, let's start setting things up.\r\nTsugumi: Data from your training will be collected automatically, so, once you've decided you've done enough, go and defeat the final boss. The simulation will end then.\r\nKihiro: Understood, Miss Ban! Let's bring down the final boss together, buddy!\r\nHiyori: Y-Yeah...\r\nHiyori: (......I'm not so sure about this.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Fantasy - Hiyori: End]: Cheering Drone!\r\n\r\nAradama: GYAAGYAA!\r\nHiyori: Gh... Their attack power keeps going up...!\r\nKihiro: At times like these, leave it to me! Activate magic: Cheering Drone!\r\nKihiro: Go now, Miss Juujou! Bring down the aradama while your defense is boosted!\r\nHiyori: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nAradama: GYAAAAAAA...\r\nHiyori: Thanks, Morishita-san.\r\nKihiro: It's only reasonable I'd do this much!\r\nKihiro: By the way, along with boosting defenses, Cheering Drone has one more hidden effect...\r\nHiyori: D-Does it...?\r\n\r\nHiyori: (I wasn't sure how this would turn out, but things are going well so far.)\r\nHiyori: (...Though, it's hard keeping up with Morishita-san.)\r\nKihiro: You know, this was more intriguing than I was expecting! Miss Ban and her team have done a good job!\r\nHiyori: She's right that this feels more like a game than usual training. This should make it easy for toji who don't like practicing to get into.\r\nKihiro: And it would be even more fun forming a party with friends~!\r\nKihiro: If I could request something, I'd want for it to be enhanced into a fully open world style VR game.\r\nKihiro: Add in a plethora of skills, and it would fly off shelves if put out for sale. Then research funds would come pouring in!\r\nHiyori: ...Leaving that aside, did you get any inspiration for making equipment?\r\nKihiro: I certainly did! The spark of inspiration's shining bright! My plan is to shut myself in the laboratory as soon as we return!\r\nHiyori: Alright. We've fought enough battles, so we should be ready.\r\nHiyori: She told us the training ends when we beat the final boss...\r\nKihiro: We can travel through the map to the final boss room at any time. Are you prepared to go?\r\nHiyori: Yeah, let's go.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Thank you for going through the training. This allowed me to get some nice data.\r\nHiyori: That's good.\r\nTsugumi: You can do it some other day, but I want you to submit a report on your personal experience with it.\r\nHiyori: Got it. Though, it was pretty incredible.\r\nHiyori: It was like we really were on a fantasy adventure.\r\nKihiro: Miss Ban! Whenever you're going to update this game, please let me know!\r\nKihiro: I'd like to make equipment for it~!\r\nTsugumi: That... does sound interesting.\r\nKihiro: Some equipment might be too dangerous to use in the real world, but, inside there, woohoo!\r\nTsugumi: Fufu, I could get some good data from that.\r\nKihiro: Miss Ban!\r\nTsugumi: Morishita-san!\r\nHiyori: (I get the feeling two people who should never team up just got put together...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/61uP0-QaIpA\r\n[Pirate - Hiyori: Start]: Inami and Shichinosato and...\r\n\r\nAradama: KSHAAAAAA...!!\r\nSuu: ...I-It's here!?\r\nHiyori: (There's no way she'll beat it hunched over in fear like that--)\r\nSuu: Uwah!? Uwahh!?\r\nHiyori: HAAH...!\r\nAradama: GUOOooo...\r\nHiyori: Honestly... What are you even doing? Calm down and hold your okatana properly. Are you trying to get yourself hurt?\r\nSuu: ...G-Got it! Thank you so much, Juujou-san!\r\n\r\nSuu: You really did help me out back there...! I wasn't sure what would happen for a minute...\r\nHiyori: I get that you're scared, but... If you keep acting like that on missions, you're going to get hurt someday. You and your--\r\nEllen: Hiyoyon, Inamin! Good news, I have a surprise for you-.\r\nHiyori: Nn? What do you mean, Ellen?\r\nEllen: Get this. The amusement park people asked if we wanted to try playing with their new attraction.\r\nEllen: It's a special service, since us toji are always working so hard.\r\nSuu: You don't mean... \"Treasures of the Pirates\"...!\r\nEllen: You sure do know your stuff, Inamin.\r\nEllen: Everyone else can't wait to try it, so, will you two be joining in?\r\nHiyori: Sure. Can't exactly... be the only one going back early.\r\nEllen: Fufu, thanks for that~.\r\nHiyori: What's this attraction like?\r\nEllen: From the sound of it, we're all pirates searching for treasure. You can steal maps from other pirates too... the other people competing to get the treasure, so there's different ways to play.\r\nHiyori: You can steal maps from the other players?\r\nSuu: It's sort of a team battle treasure hunt, but all the maps each team gets are different, and some of them are supposed to be fakes.\r\nHiyori: I see. It sounds a bit tough. How about let Kofuki know and head over for now.\r\nSuu: U-Um... I'll let you two tell Shichinosato-san about this by yourselves.\r\nEllen: Sure thing. Don't worry. I'll break it to Fukki so she'll join us for sure-!\r\nSuu: I-I leave it to you...!\r\n\r\nSuu: ...So then, we'll be aiming to clear \"Treasures of the Pirates\" with the teams we were in fighting aradama before...\r\nSuu: But, what should we do? Juujou-san, Shichinosato-san...\r\nKofuki: I don't really have a choice, so I'll do this with you; at least till we get to the X on the map.\r\nHiyori: Are we fine with not going after the other team's maps?\r\nKofuki: Mihocchi was all, \"Let's plunder-!\" but if the map you steal's no good, there's no point.\r\nSuu: ...I think that's fine! It's important to clear the game fast too!\r\nHiyori: There is a time limit; they were saying it goes until the cannons fire 3 times.\r\nSuu: It should be just about thirty minutes.\r\nHiyori: We might be hard on time if we get in fights.\r\nHiyori: There's a drawing like a cave on our treasure map, so we should go there first...\r\nHiyori: You can hold onto the map.\r\nKofuki: You know I'm just here to make the team's even, right?\r\nHiyori: Suu's... not the most reliable.\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nKofuki: Tch... Guess if I've gotta.\r\nSuu: Ehh... As long as there aren't any aradama, I'm not like that! ...I won't lose the map, okay!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pirate - Hiyori: End]: This Might Not Be So Bad Every Now and Then... Huh\r\n\r\nSuu: I didn't think the cave drawing on the map would take us to a big stalactite cave facility, and they even had a boat for us. This has to be it--\r\nSuu: --HYAUU!?\r\nKofuki: Don't shout like that outta nowhere... You made me jump.\r\nSuu: But some water dripped on me! They made this way too real in some weird places...\r\nHiyori: Anyway, you were just saying you thought this was it; why's that?\r\nSuu: They put a lot of effort into making this place, so I don't think they'd go this far if the right treasure wasn't here.\r\nKofuki: Putting it pretty straight out there. Though, this does feel like the kinda place that'd have a pirate treasure.\r\nHiyori: So that's another way of looking for it. Then, there's a good chance the treasure's up ahead.\r\nSuu: The old pirates' treasured pendants should be here. Finding that is the best way to get points in this game.\r\n\r\nHiyori: Oi... Look! Over there.\r\nSuu: Wow... That's a super realistic looking skeleton!\r\nKofuki: This must be it. Hey you, go and get the thing.\r\nSuu: Roger that-. Inami Suu is setting off-.\r\n\r\nAradama: GYUUU...!\r\nSuu: GYAAH!? Something came out!?\r\nSuu: ...A-A-A-Aradamaaa!?\r\nKofuki: ...What!? After it!\r\n\r\nAradama: ......\r\nKofuki: You're running around all over the place, but this is it!\r\nHiyori: It was so small it hardly showed up on the spectrum finder, so it's a good thing we found it.\r\nKofuki: There might be others around; let's look.\r\nHiyori: Should we message Ellen and Kiyoka and them?\r\nKofuki: Shouldn't have to. The two of us are enough. Well, I could do it myself though.\r\nHiyori: Maybe you could, but you shouldn't go alone.\r\nHiyori: ...What about Suu?\r\nKofuki: There was just one of them, so she'll be fine back there. Let's get this done as fast as we can.\r\n\r\nSuu: Even if... I don't want to fight aradama... I thought it was really mean the way you left me behind!\r\nKofuki: We still came back fast enough.\r\nSuu: I think that place might have been starting to give me a fear of the dark too...\r\nHiyori: Though from the looks of it, it didn't.\r\nHiyori: And anyway, thanks to you, we got the pendant.\r\nSuu: Juujou-san, are you... trying really poorly to make me feel better?\r\nHiyori: ...Urgh. I do feel a little bad.\r\nKofuki: Next time something happens, I'll beat some aradama-chan for you to make up for it.\r\nHiyori: And you... You just want to hunt aradama yourself, am I wrong?\r\nSuu: That's right, tell her some more!\r\nKofuki: Oh! Mihocchi and Kiyoka are headed over. Go shove this pendant in their faces, Hunchback.\r\nSuu: Hunchback!? Could you please not call me weird names... It's rude!\r\nHiyori: Good grief..."}, {"paste_key": "T7FnrPQR", "title": "Musumi Kiyoka Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/T7FnrPQR", "timestamp": "", "hits": "116", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlXPwLDgDeY\r\nhttps://youtu.be/6_yDBybZI3Y\r\nhttps://youtu.be/H9uezyeVchU\r\nhttps://youtu.be/F1HUf5KE_sc\r\n\r\n1: I Have a Friend, Meow-\r\n\r\nMihono: Oh yeah, so what's your friend like, Musumi-san? You said you were close to someone at Heijou.\r\nKiyoka: She's really energetic, and she loves animals.\r\nChie: Ah, I'm curious too. Do you mind if I listen in?\r\nKiyoka: Sure. She's a year older than me though. When we first met, we were on a mission together...\r\n\r\nNaruse Miki: We in Naruse Squad will be pursuing the aradama who have fled into the mountains... Hm? Where'd Himeno-san run off to? She was just here a moment ago.\r\nMiki: Hmmm... Musumi-san, could you go look for her? We can't operate effectively if we're all split up~\r\nKiyoka: Ah... Okay. I'll try.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Himeno-saaan... Where are you... Himeno-saaan!\r\nHimeno Shiho: Shh! Don't make too much noise!\r\nKiyoka: H-Himeno-san...\r\n\tMeow- Meow- Meow- Meow-\r\nKiyoka: There's... Kittens...?\r\nShiho: Aren't they adorable? With the aradama in the area, I felt like I had to keep them safe.\r\nShiho: But something's not right. I looked around the area and couldn't find their mom anywhere.\r\nShiho: If we don't find her soon, she might get mixed up in the Special Ritual Squad fighting the aradama, and then...\r\nKiyoka: What was that...?\r\nShiho: Just what I was afraid of... That sounds like the aradama... They must be after the mother!\r\nKiyoka: How terrible... Himeno-san, we have to get the rest of the squad...\r\nShiho: I won't let them hurt her!\r\n\r\nShiho: Pant... Pant...\r\nShiho: Sorry, Musumi-san. I got carried away and pulled you into that... I'm a failure as a senpai.\r\n\tMeow- Meow- Meow- Meow-\r\nShiho: Sorry. When I thought these kittens and their mom could get hurt, I lost control and abandoned the rest of the squad.\r\nShiho: And even then, I was too late... Their mother...\r\nShiho: But still, you remind me of those kittens, Musumi-san. Always so weak and innocent... For me to put you in danger like that...\r\nShiho: That's why... I'm... I'm really sorry.\r\nKiyoka: Don't be! You don't have to apologize. I... I don't like to fight... I hate it, but... I understand how you feel, Himeko-san.\r\nShiho: Thank you. But, for me to run off on my own like this, I'm going to get punished pretty hard, aren't I...\r\nKiyoka: Umm... Probably...\r\n\r\nKiyoka: ...And that's what happened. After we reunited with everyone else, we both got scolded a lot. But I don't think they were actually mad at us.\r\nMihono: Ahh, I would have felt the same. You just gotta help out at a time like that!\r\nChie: Himeno Shiho-san really loves animals, doesn't she?\r\nKiyoka: Yes. Whenever I go on missions with Shiho-san, she's always teaching me about what kind of animals live around there... I hate having to fight, but that makes it kind of fun~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Do You Like It? Or Do You Hate It?\r\n\r\nMihono: Hey, Kiyoka, do you wanna come train with me?\r\nKiyoka: Me? Are you sure? You could probably find someone better...\r\nMihono: Well, Chii-nee and Mirja-san were both busy. Plus, I want to find out how strong you really are.\r\nKiyoka: ...O-Okay, I'll try it.\r\n\r\nMihono: We'll use wooden swords in a three round match. It's not first to two wins, just three whole rounds.\r\nMihono: ...Here I come!\r\n\r\nMihono: Eh...? What was that... I couldn't get through!?\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: ...Then, round two, let's start.\r\n\r\nMihono: Twice in a row... Alright! This is where it counts!\r\nKiyoka: Y-Yes.\r\nMihono: I'm going to seriously come at you now!\r\n\r\nMihono: ...I couldn't win a single round in the end.\r\nMihono: ...What the heck! I don't believe it!? Kiyoka, you're crazy strong!\r\nMihono: Honestly, in that last fight, I felt like I put everything into my swings, but it was like hitting a wall. I couldn't break your guard.\r\nMihono: Ahhh, I feel so weak! This sucks...\r\nKiyoka: Um... I-I just... Sor-\r\nMihono: Stop right there! You were about to say sorry, right! You're not allowed to!\r\nMihono: Instead, I want you to explain something to me. How can you be that strong but so scared of fighting?\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nKiyoka: Because you could get hurt, and it's scary, isn't it? I mean...\r\nKiyoka: Even with utsushi on, you can still feel pain. And if utsushi gets broken and you're attacked by an okatana or an aradama, you could die, you know?\r\nKiyoka: I'm the one who doesn't understand... How all of you can be okay with it.\r\nMihono: And that's why you avoid fighting?\r\nKiyoka: ...Yes.\r\nKiyoka: I love practicing with wooden and imitation swords in the dojo...\r\nKiyoka: In the dojo, I used to be called a \"genius\" and \"prodigy\"... But I don't think I deserved it.\r\nKiyoka: I just really loved practicing with a sword. As I kept rising through the ranks, everyone had these expectations that I'd go out and fight aradama, and I was sent to the Heijou Institute...\r\nKiyoka: But... I was useless.\r\nMihono: When it came to actual fighting, you were frozen in fear?\r\nKiyoka: Yes.\r\nKiyoka: To cut someone or be cut by someone else, or to be injured by an aradama... It really scares me. In the end, I just love the practice of martial arts.\r\nKiyoka: That's why, fighting you now, Asakura-san, was the first time in a long while that I've enjoyed it. I forgot everything else and only focused on our match... So, thank you very much for asking to train with me today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Teruhiro and Kagemitsu\r\n\r\n???: Hey, hey, you there, from Heijou!\r\nKiyoka: Ah, uh, yes!?\r\nKiyoka: W-Who might you be...?\r\nKoike Saaya: Whoops, sorry. It's rare to see someone else from Heijou around here, so I just had to call out to you. I'm Koike Saaya, a third year high schooler at Heijou.\r\nSaaya: Ever since last September I've been interning here; getting on the job training at the prefectural police station. Ah, it's just deskwork though.\r\nSaaya: So are you here to watch the tournament? Wait, if you were here to see that, you'd already... Have gone back...\r\nKiyoka: K-Koike-san? I-Is something wrong?\r\nSaaya: I might be mistaken, but... Is that Teruhiro?\r\nKiyoka: Ah, yes. My okatana is Renge Fudou Teruhiro.\r\nSaaya: Ahh... I knew it. It's been so long, but... It doesn't feel real... I'm even tearing up... That used to be my okatana, you see.\r\nKiyoka: Eh...?\r\nSaaya: Ah, sorry... Meeting the previous owner must be like running into your lover's old ex, huh? It's not really a happy topic.\r\nSaaya: I made this really awkward. Sorry! Just pretend I didn't say anything.\r\nKiyoka: No, it's not like that... Um, if you don't mind, I'd like to hear more about that, actually...!\r\nSaaya: Okay. But first, can you tell me about yourself too?\r\n\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nKiyoka: To tell you the truth, Renge Fudou Teruhiro is my second okatana. Originally, I had a different one... Koryuu Kagemitsu. That one chose me first...\r\nKiyoka: Apparently I had better compatibility with it than anyone else, and so it was officially given to me. I loved it so much too, and thought we'd always be together. But, last fall, it suddenly stopped responding to me...\r\nKiyoka: It must have been... Because I'm such a weakling, that it ran out of patience. I... I don't like to fight, and so because of that, Kagemitsu just gave up on me.\r\nSaaya: I see. ...Hmm. Can you let me hold Teruhiro?\r\nKiyoka: Ah, sure, here you go.\r\nSaaya: I just need to borrow him for a minute...\r\nSaaya: ......\r\nSaaya: Mm, I can still do jin'i, and I could even form utsushi a little now. Holding it like this reminds me what it was like to be a toji.\r\nSaaya: Though, it's a little embarrassing to admit, but... As a toji, I was pretty mediocre. Here, you can have him back.\r\nSaaya: ...About three years ago, they found someone more capable of using Renge Fudou Teruhiro than me. At that time, I handed in my okatana and retired from being a toji.\r\nSaaya: It all ended so fast, but I didn't feel like I had any regrets. If anything, doing support work like I am now suits me much better.\r\nSaaya: ...Hey, Kiyoka-chan. Don't you think Teruhiro feels very kind?\r\nKiyoka: Eh...?\r\nSaaya: After all, even after Koryuu Kagemitsu left you, Teruhiro stayed by your side.\r\nSaaya: Even after I haven't held him in three years, letting me use my powers again was like his way of saying \"Welcome back\".\r\nSaaya: I'm sure whoever it was that owned him between me and you was helped out by that kindness as well.\r\nSaaya: Can't you feel it? Throughout your whole body, like he's reassuring you, \"I don't mind if you're weak.\"\r\nKiyoka: Renge Fudou Teruhiro... Doesn't mind...?\r\nSaaya: That's it. So right now, please take good care of him for me. And if you do that, I'm sure you'll grow into a strong woman.\r\nKiyoka: A strong woman?\r\nSaaya: Yeah, a strong woman who can strike out beautifully with a blade. Teruhiro wants you to grow stronger together.\u3000Strong enough that one day you'll make even Koryuu Kagemitsu jealous!\r\nKiyoka: Koike-senpai...\r\nSaaya: Oh, you finally smiled! Ah~, but then you'll have two okatana calling after you. You'll have to deal with how tough it can be being popular, Kiyoka-chan~.\r\nKiyoka: Ah... Okay, I'll have to find out!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Chinami's a Beautiful Girl, By the Way (it's a whole pun with Chinami and chinami ni, meaning by the way)\r\n\r\nMihono: You're pretty trendy, aren't you, Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: Eh, I-I don't think I am...\r\nMihono: But you know so much more than us.\r\nKiyoka: Well, I have a teacher... Or more like, a role model.\r\nMihono: A friend of yours? What's she like? How'd you meet her?\r\nChie: Mihono-chan, if you keep asking her questions she won't have time to answer any...\r\nKiyoka: It's okay. Well, she's...\r\n\r\nKiyoka: I have to get to the school store! It's going to sell out! Today's the release of the new monthly issue!\r\nKiyoka: And Kamo Chinami-san is on the cover! I have to get it!\r\nKiyoka: I mean...\r\nKiyoka: Kamo Chinami-san is such a hot topic right now. She's so pretty, and fashionable, and her swordfighting techniques are cool in a cute way, and she's just so beautiful from head to toe.\r\nKiyoka: Boys fall in love with her and girls want to be like her. It's not surprising that the squad she's in gets chased around by journalists looking to upload new photos to the internet.\r\nKiyoka: When I think of the word \"heroine\", without a doubt, it's Chinami-senpai that comes to mind.\r\nKiyoka: ...That's right. She's the complete opposite of an unappealing girl like me, who's useless at anything that's not in a dojo...\r\n\r\nKiyoka: I made it! Ah! And just in time! There's one copy left!\r\nKiyoka: ...I'll take it!\r\n*Kiyoka bumps into someone*\r\n???: Hey, do you mind letting go?\r\nKiyoka: U-Um! I-I was here first...! A-And I always buy this magazine every month! It's my bible, s-so...\r\n???: Well, I'm in similar circumstances. So we're equally qualified, aren't we?\r\nKiyoka: I-I can't back down here...!\r\n???: Then what should we do... For starters, could you stop looking at the floor? C'mon, lift your chin up.\r\nKiyoka: Um... Ah... Kamo... Chinami-senpai!?\r\nChinami: That's me.\r\nChinami: So, would you be willing to give me that book? A friend of mine has been dying to get it... Or is it no use?\r\nKiyoka: Eh, no... This is... It's a misunderstanding... I'm just so nervous I can't let go...\r\nChinami: ... ....... ..........\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nChinami: You want it after all, don't you?\r\nKiyoka: N-No, I don't mind if you take it...\r\nChinami: Really? Is that how you really feel? I think you just don't want to let anyone take what you want from you. Well, that's how a girl ought to be!\r\nChinami: I don't think there's anything wrong with that!\r\nChinami: Hey, what's your name?\r\nKiyoka: M-My name...? It's... Musumi Kiyoka...\r\nChinami: Then I'm Kamo Chinami... But you knew that already, didn't you? Alright then, Kiyoka. You win this one.\r\nChinami: My friend can just wait for the publisher to send me a copy. Here, you keep this one.\r\nKiyoka: Eh...?\r\nChinami: Oh yeah, you said you always buy this magazine? You've got some good fashion sense. That's promising.\r\nChinami: You just need to start putting it into practice. If you want to be something, you've gotta try being it~\r\nChinami: Anyway, I have to get going! If you ever want any tips about fashion, feel free to ask me, okay? Onee-san here'll give you a total makeover!\r\nChinami: See you around! Bye!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: And that's how we met.\r\nKiyoka: I didn't get a chance to apologize to her then, so I went to see her later. And we kept getting closer ever since...\r\nMihono: It almost sounds like... You got picked up by someone handsome.\r\nKiyoka: I guess she's my handsome onee-san?\r\nChie: I've heard of her, Kamo Chinami-san. She does amateur modeling. You're surprisingly well connected, Kiyoka-chan...\r\nMihono: Is this her femininity in action!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Thesis! What is Femininity!\r\n\r\nMihono: Grrrrrr.... Grr.\r\nKiyoka: Why are you looking so upset, Hono-chan? That's not like you.\r\nMihono: Don't act like you're so innocent... (Stare......)\r\nKiyoka: W-What is it...? When you stare at me like that... I-It's really embarrassing...\r\nMihono: There! There it is! That bashfulness!\r\nMihono: It must be nice, Kiyoka~ Having that much femininity... Meanwhile, I've got none of that...\r\nKiyoka: There it is!!\r\nMihono: Eh!? W-What is...?\r\nKiyoka: Just now, you said \"femininity\", didn't you, Hono-chan!? What does \"femininity\" mean to you!?\r\nMihono: What's up with you!? It's not like you to be so aggressive, Kiyoka... That scared me.\r\nKiyoka: Ah... I'm sorry. I'll explain. The other day, Yanase Mai-san and I were baking cookies together, and we got into a discussion about what femininity means.\r\nMihono: S-So that's why...? Well, femininity means \"cute and girly things\", doesn't it? You've got a lot of it, Kiyoka. You're cute and make me want to protect you.\r\nKiyoka: Really, you think I'm cute...? But that's not important right now! Hono-chan, that way of thinking is wrong!\r\nKiyoka: Listen up! You could say femininity means \"for a girl to be alluring while doing girly things\"!\r\nMihono: O-Okay...\r\nKiyoka: But, to be more fashionable. To be a better cook. To be more considerate. To be more accepting... There are all kinds of answers, yet all of them are right!\r\nKiyoka: That's why... Femininity is something only you can decide on the definition of!\r\nKiyoka: For each person to imagine their ideal girl, and then to put in effort making that a reality... That's what \"femininity\" is all about!\r\nKiyoka: Essentially...\r\nKiyoka: For each and every girl out there, there's a different definition of femininity! Understand? That's the final answer I've arrived at!\r\nKiyoka: (How's that!)\r\nMihono: I-I guess... You have a point there...\r\nKiyoka: Right? So you could get stronger at swordfighting and become a cooler girl! That's an ideal! Thinking like that, practicing swordfighting is a perfectly valid way of raising your femininity!\r\nKiyoka: A sword isn't just a way of becoming stronger, but also cuter in a cool way! In that sense, you're training in two things at once! If you want to be more popular, you just need to think about what makes a female swordfighter popular in the first place!\r\nKiyoka: ...Phew! Without an ideal to strive for, you'll never express your femininity!\r\nMihono: I-I think I get it... An ideal. Okay...\r\nMihono: (I've never seen Kiyoka like this before. I'm still sort of reeling...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/6_yDBybZI3Y\r\n[Bride '19: Start]: Undercover Investigation (Kiyoka's Case)\r\n\r\nYui: Ehhh!? Aradama showed up at the wedding chapel again!?\r\nKiyoka: Mm, it sounds like it.\r\nKiyoka: Apparently another ring was stolen, so maybe it's the same aradama from before?\r\nYui: Stealing a ring from a bride-to-be at the happiest moment of her life; Yamashiro Yui, ally to women around the world, won't let this stand!\r\nKiyoka: ...Though sometimes, you're their enemy.\r\nYui: Ahaha, there you go again with your jokes~.\r\nKiyoka: A ha ha ha.\r\nYui: Kiyoka-chan, your smile's looking a little forced, isn't it-?\r\n\r\nKiyoka/Yui: An undercover investigation?\r\nChapel Staff: That's right. If one of you acts as a decoy, we can find where the aradama hid the ring, right?\r\nYui: ...Did you know about this? [whispered]\r\nKiyoka: No, they only said we'd learn the details when we arrived... [whispered]\r\nChapel Staff: Um...?\r\nYui: Ah, it's nothing! That'll be just fine with us! Please, just let us handle everything!\r\nChapel Staff: We'll be counting on you then. So... Which of you will wear the wedding dress?\r\nKiyoka/Yui: ......\r\nKiyoka: (I want to wear a wedding dress! But, Yui-chan...)\r\nYui: Hm? What could be on your mind, Kiyoka-chan? Here, don't be shy, let's get you into that dress!\r\nKiyoka: But...\r\nYui: Huh, do you not want to wear it? You like wedding dresses, don't you, Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKiyoka: I-I do.\r\nYui: I'm just teasing you. I know what you're thinking. You're worried I'm going to do something weird, right?\r\nKiyoka: You realized!?\r\nYui: Of course, it's me we're talking about.\r\nKiyoka: Then... You won't come in while I'm changing?\r\nYui: I- won't- come- in-?\r\nKiyoka: Why did that sound so phony!?\r\nYui: Sorry, sorry, I'm just kidding, Kiyoka-chan. I would never force my way in on you while you're changing.\r\nYui: We're in a wedding chapel after all, so I'll swear to God to keep my word.\r\nKiyoka: Still...\r\nChapel Staff: Excuse me, you can lock the waiting room door, so...\r\nKiyoka: Okay! I'll dress up as the decoy!\r\nYui: That's how little you trust me!?\r\n\r\nYui: Fu, fufufu... As if I'd try. Peeping on you while you were changing was never what I was after, Kiyoka-chan...\r\nYui: It's my chance to see you in a wedding dress, so I have to make sure you get changed first! Excuse me, Mr. Staffmember! Could I please borrow a camera!\r\nChapel Staff: A... Camera?\r\nYui: That's right! I need a camera, to record the aradama from a distance!\r\nChapel Staff: Oh, of course! I'll get you one right away!\r\nYui: Now everything's ready to go...! All that's left is... To wait for Kiyoka-chan!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Bride '19: End]: Shutter Chance!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan really never came...\r\nKiyoka: There wasn't any sign of her trying to unlock the door, so she wasn't lying.\r\nKiyoka: Sigh, I should have trusted her more... I was rude to Yui-chan, wasn't I...\r\n\r\nYui: Oh, welcome back, Kiyoka-chan! You look so good in that wedding dress! We should get married right away!\r\nKiyoka: Thank you... Hey, why do you have that camera!? You didn't have it before, did you!?\r\nYui: That's the expression I'm looking for!\r\nKiyoka: Answer the question!\r\nYui: Why...? The staff here lent it to me.\r\nKiyoka: Why would they do that!?\r\nYui: All I had to do was say I wanted to record pictures of the aradama, and they handed it right over.\r\nKiyoka: Of course they would, if you put it like that...\r\nYui: Pretty quick thinking on my part, huh?\r\nKiyoka: It's devious...\r\nKiyoka: KYAA-!?\r\nYui: Got that expression too! It's so good-, you're so cute, Chan-kiyo!\r\nKiyoka: Chan-kiyo...\r\nYui: But, no matter what, a girl's smile is always best! Go on, smile for me!\r\nYui: And if you'd try flaunting your chest while you're at it, I'd be even happier!\r\nKiyoka: Well I'm sorry you can't see my chest unless I flaunt it, okay!?\r\nYui: All breasts, big and small, are beautiful, Kiyoka-chan!\r\nKiyoka: That's not making me feel any better-!\r\nYui: Hmmm, I thought you'd be acting more embarrassed... Whoopsie.\r\nKiyoka: Stop trying to embarrass me so you can take pictures...\r\nYui: I'm just screwing around, you know. Since you do get to wear a wedding dress and all, wouldn't you want some pictures taken?\r\nKiyoka: You seemed totally serious to me... But, still... This wedding dress is very cute...\r\nYui: Isn't it? So just leave it to me, your cameraman.\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan... Why are you down there on the floor?\r\nYui: Well I have to take some low angle shots of you, don't I? Don't worry, I'll be sure your panties don't show up in the pictures!\r\nKiyoka: Panties...!?\r\nKiyoka: Did you just take a picture of them!?\r\nYui: Relax, the only record of your panties is safe in my memories.\r\nKiyoka: I don't want that either----!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/H9uezyeVchU\r\n[Yuusha 2: Kiyoka: Start]: To Boost Up Our Girl Power!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: This time, the two of us will be suppressing aradama as a pair. You might not be able to rely on me for much... But I look forward to working with you.\r\nFuu: That's not true at all. I'll be counting on you, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nKiyoka: (Th-That's right. A hero like Fuu-san might be helping to clear out the aradama... But this is where a toji like me needs to get it together...!)\r\nKiyoka: Umm... Then, let's give it everything we've got, Fuu-san!\r\nFuu: Are you maybe feeling a bit nervous today?\r\nKiyoka: Ah... No, it's not like that!\r\nFuu: Then, that's fine, but it's not good for you to go all out all the time, alright?\r\nFuu: If you can't show your strength when it counts, you'll be in trouble, won't you?\r\nKiyoka: You're right about that. To tell the truth... I was feeling like I had to try even harder than usual.\r\nFuu: That feeling's important too. There's not a single thing wrong with feeling that way.\r\nKiyoka: How is it you can be so calm, Fuu-san? You're going through so much trouble, coming to our world and then helping us fight aradama, and yet...\r\nFuu: It's because I'm the leader of the Hero Club. Who's going to follow me if I don't take everything in stride?\r\nFuu: Though it's not really like that. It's hard for me to put in words, but, well... We're the ones who decided to help out defeating the aradama, and we know we can trust you toji.\r\nFuu: Anyway, if things get bad, I can just weaken the aradama with my overflowing girl power, so I'll be counting on you to finish them off, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: Your overflowing... Girl power!\r\nAradama: GUGGGGGIIII...!!\r\nFuu: Ah, there they are!\r\nKiyoka: Let's go, Fuu-san!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: ...And so that's what happened. She was a big help, getting me over my strange nervousness and finishing up our mission.\r\nItsuki: Onee-chan is good at picking up on things like that.\r\nKiyoka: Fuu-san has a strong sense of leadership, doesn't she. It's a different from Mirja-san, but I found myself depending on her before I knew it.\r\nKiyoka: On top of that, she's so cool and feminine.\r\nItsuki: Hmmm... I feel like you're the more feminine one, Kiyoka-san. You know so much about fashion, and the way you accessorize is cute too.\r\nKiyoka: I'm not that... I still have a long ways to go. I also heard about Fuu-san that her cooking is her specialty.\r\nItsuki: Onee-chan's cooking is delicious. She does all the chores around home too.\r\nKiyoka: She's incredible... I really look up to her. I might've wanted to have a big sister like that myself.\r\nFuu: What do you think, Itsuki? About your reliable big sister you're so proud of.\r\nItsuki: Come on, Onee-chan. You're letting it go to your head.\r\nKiyoka: Fuu-san!\r\nFuu: Ah, sorry for getting caught up in the moment.\r\nKiyoka: I... I want to learn to be as feminine as you are, Fuu-san! Could I ask you to give me special training to raise my girl power...!?\r\nItsuki: Ehh...!? Um, Kiyoka-san... I think it would be best if you didn't go there. About Oee-chan's... girl power...\r\nFuu: I hear your request loud and clear. I don't know how long it will take, but I'll do all I can to help boost your girl power, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Ah, thank you very much... Fuu-san!\r\nFuu: The road to improving your girl power is steep and perilous. We'll start your training straight away, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Okay!\r\nItsuki: Th-They'll be fine... Probably?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Yuusha 2: Kiyoka: End]: The Key to Raising One's Girl Power is...\r\n\r\nTougou: Hey, Itsuki-chan? We just ate a little while ago, so why are Fuu-senpai and Kiyoka-chan sitting in front of bowls of udon?\r\nItsuki: That's because...\r\nFuu: There's lots of things that can boost your girl power, like practicing cooking and stuff, but the most effective method is udon!\r\nKiyoka: Udon!?\r\nFuu: That's right. Udon is packed with all the ingredients you need for girl power! And-, with enough girl power, you can do anything-!\r\nKiyoka: I-I got it!\r\nKiyoka: (I don't exactly understand... why eating udon is meant to make you more feminine. But I just have to have faith in Fuu-san for now.)\r\nFuu: Now, eat up the udon that's loved by all across the nation, and raise up your girl power!\r\nKiyoka: Udon is loved on that kind of level in the world you came from!?\r\nFuu: Sure; udon is at the very tip top of gourmet food. Come on, while it's still hot!\r\nKiyoka: I-I'll give it a try...!\r\nFuu: [chew chew]... Even in this world, udon's still the best! ...It's filling me up!\r\nKiyoka: Yes... It's very tasty, isn't it!\r\nFuu: I think I'll just keep going on into seconds...?\r\nKiyoka: [chew chew]... A-Already!? I-I have to... try harder too-!\r\nTougou: Ahh... You can't do that, Kiyoka-chan. If you try to have as many helpings as Fuu-senpai...\r\n\r\nFuu: Thank you for coming along to the Inubouzaki Fuu-style Girl Power Boosting Special Training.\r\nKiyoka: I'm sorry, but... Fuu-san? We ate udon and then exercised together, but I don't feel like I've gotten any more girl power yet...\r\nFuu: Girl power is something that exudes on its own. You might not feel it right away, but when you do, you'll know for sure it's gone up. Believe you me!\r\nKiyoka: Girl power exudes on its own... You sure know your stuff, Fuu-san.\r\nKiyoka: I understand then! Now, let's go and do a good job of suppressing aradama again today.\r\nKiyoka: Ah! There's a big park nearby here. I don't want to let the aradama come near it.\r\nFuu: Of course. We wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.\r\n\r\nFuu: Kiyoka! I drove it over your way! I'm counting on you!\r\nAradama: ...!\r\nKiyoka: --HAAA!\r\nKiyoka: The readings from aradama in the area are gone. It seems like that was the last one.\r\nFuu: Nice job-. Toji sure are something else. You had my eyes glued to the way you were handling that sword of yours.\r\nKiyoka: It's just really easy to coordinate with you, Fuu-san. So, I sort of feel like I should be thanking you.\r\nFuu: You don't have to thank me or anything. You're already doing a lot for us. Ah, actually, mind if we stop by somewhere for a bit?\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Wow... It's so pretty here. I've never been to this park before.\r\nKiyoka: It's a good thing we stopped the aradama from running amok here.\r\nFuu: That's for sure-. That's another thing you worked hard for, Kiyoka.\r\nKiyoka: That's not true... It wasn't just because of me.\r\nFuu: You can't deny you're the one who defeated all those aradama today, can you?\r\nKiyoka: Somehow, I just felt a little less hesitant today with my swordsmanship.\r\nFuu: Fu fu fu, don't you get it? That's the proof of your girl power.\r\nKiyoka: It is!?\r\nFuu: Yep. Now that your girl power's gone up, I'm sure you won't lose to any aradama. Be confident in yourself, Kiyoka.\r\nFuu: A girl full of confidence is the strongest there is.\r\nKiyoka: Now that you mention it, attractive girls always seem to have a lot of confidence, don't they.\r\nKiyoka: Thank you for all you've done for me, Fuu-san.\r\nFuu: Hm? What do you mean?\r\nKiyoka: You gave me all that encouragement to help me feel confident in myself.\r\nFuu: Ahaha-, you noticed, huh?\r\nFuu: (She caught my interest for some reason, so I might've gone overboard with getting in her business.)\r\nFuu: Did I overdo it a little?\r\nKiyoka: Fufu, only when you made girl power sound so all powerful. But, I was very glad for your help.\r\nKiyoka: I think I'll keep working towards bringing up my girl power from now on!\r\nFuu: Mmhm. That's the spirit.

We got unlucky with our timing and missed a chance to have lunch.\r\nMirja: We're back at Renpu now, so what next?\r\nKofuki: It's hot out, so let's just stay at the lounge here.\r\nMihono: I'd be fine with that. But, Kiyoka, do you know any good places to eat nearby?\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nMihono: ? Kiyoka, are you feeling sick maybe? ...Are you okay?\r\nKiyoka: Eh.\r\nKiyoka: Ah... I'm not feeling sick or anything. I just kind of had something on my mind.\r\nMihono: We were talking about, if we can't come up with anything else, let's eat a late lunch in the lounge here.\r\nKiyoka: I think eating in the lounge is fine. They just added a new menu a couple days ago too.\r\nMihono: Then, that's that! Let's get going!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Sigh...\r\nChie: Your chopsticks are hardly moving. If it's alright, do you want to talk about what's on your mind with me?\r\nKiyoka: I probably should... Is it alright if you hear me out?\r\nKiyoka: See, next week... I have to go on the workplace experience trip. And I've been worrying and worrying about whether I can do it right...\r\nKofuki: What... that's it? Who cares; just do whatever. It's not like messing it up'll kill you.\r\nKiyoka: Honestly... You're so quick to say things like that, Kofuki-san.\r\nKofuki: You just worry about stuff too much.\r\nChie: That's enough, Kofuki-chan. Telling her that isn't going to help her.\r\nMirja: Where will you be going for your workplace experience, Musumi Kiyoka?\r\nKiyoka: It's a hotel, or, a ryokan. I'm meant to be working as a hostess... and I'm feeling a little hopeless about it now.\r\nMihono: Wait, really? If you're going to a ryokan, you'd get to eat yummy food and stuff, so isn't that pretty lucky?\r\nKofuki: Mihocchi...\r\nKiyoka: Even if it's only just for that day... If only I could turn into Hono-chan...\r\nMirja: Even if you can't be Asakura Mihono, it's important that you take a positive outlook like she has.\r\nMirja: Instead of setting out to do all of your work perfectly, why not just aim to do the tasks you want to do well on properly?\r\nChie: I agree. I don't think they'll be asking for students getting workplace experience to be perfect at their jobs.\r\nChie: So I hope, while you're working, you can find something you have fun with and that makes you want to keep at it.\r\nKiyoka: I'll try thinking about how to have fun with it like Hono-chan would.\r\nMihono: So wait; it kinda feels like I helped?\r\nKiyoka: You did, so thanks.\r\nMihono: You're welcome then!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Hostess - Kiyoka: End]: Hopefully it Goes Well\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Umm, this meal was for the room to the left of the one before--\r\nMihono: H-Help me, Kiyokaaaaaaaaa!!\r\nKiyoka: ...Hyau!? What's the matter, Hono-chan!?\r\nMihono: The food I was making turned into an aradama!\r\nMihono: What do I do!?\r\nKiyoka: Ehh!? Why did it do that!? First... W-W-W-We have to calm down...!?\r\nKiyoka: ...Right! We use our okatana at times like these!\r\nMihono: Oh yeah, our okatana!\r\nMihono: This'll do it... in a jiffy!\r\nKiyoka: Wait, Hono-chan! You're holding a fire extinguisher!!\r\nMihono: SHHUU---!!\r\nKiyoka: Ah, everything's gone all white!?\r\nMihono: SHHUU---!!\r\nKiyoka: I can't see the aradama! Stop it, Hono-chan!!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: S-Stop doing that-!\r\nKiyoka: ...Oh, huh. It was a dream... Sighh... Thank goodness.\r\nKiyoka: That weird dream was probably because I keep thinking about the workplace experience. I was even with Hono-chan, even though we're from different schools.\r\nKiyoka: Maybe I shouldn't have set the AC to shut off on a timer either.\r\nKiyoka: Let's turn the AC on and go back to sleep.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: So then, I thought I was in the middle of my workplace experience, but at the end... You were shooting a fire extinguisher, and everything went white. It was such a weird dream.\r\nKiyoka: And it woke me up and I couldn't get back to sleep last night. It gave me a lot of trouble.\r\nMihono: So that's why you were yawning before. But still, I know it's a dream, but none of that made any sense.\r\nKiyoka: It's all your fault, Hono-chan-. I mean, how did you turn food into aradama?\r\nMihono: How am I supposed to know! That was the just me from your dream!\r\nKiyoka: Fufu, sorry. By the way, where did you go for your workplace experience, Hono-chan?\r\nMihono: For my one, I went to a kindergarten. But it was pretty fun! I got to play around with the kids, and take a nap.\r\nKiyoka: You seem like you'd be really good at working with kids, after all.\r\nMihono: Yeah. We got along great. They told me to come back again, but I'm too busy with missions to stop by.\r\nKiyoka: ...It'd be a little hard to fit in, wouldn't it.\r\nMihono: Yeah, with school and missions and all. Maybe if I could take time off from class, but there's no way they'd let me.\r\nMihono: When you do your workplace experience in 2 days, it might be hard on you, but give it your best shot. I'm sure you'll have fun with it.\r\nKiyoka: Sure! I hope I'll get to have as much fun as you did, Hono-chan.\r\n"}, {"paste_key": "f67r9tzs", "title": "Kitora Mirja Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/f67r9tzs", "timestamp": "", "hits": "164", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nwUhaRIgmI\r\nhttps://youtu.be/N8q9gtW9xcY\r\nhttps://youtu.be/vrh9FfXuL1I\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Y6ff2yewfcQ\r\nhttps://youtu.be/vMJ0ViPK_JA\r\nhttps://youtu.be/f6NzJE7uOCo\r\n\r\n1: The Proper Method of Using a Tank\r\n\r\nMizushina Kinuka: By the way, Kitora-san. There's been talk about how Nakano-san's aradama killcount hasn't been going up. What's your opinion on that, as her commander in the field?\r\nKinuka: Don't you try to provide all the girls in your squad with equal opportunities in battle? So please, tell me what you think.\r\nMirja: I don't mind, but... Is there really a problem with Nakano Jun? I don't believe there are many toji as capable as her.\r\nKinuka: So you feel the same way... But, the big headed types at General Headquarters and the other commanding officers just don't get it.\r\nMirja: Oh... I see.\r\nMirja: Then, the next time we face aradama in battle, I'll place Nakano Jun at the center of our formation. Have headquarters monitor us, and ask commanders from other squads to review it as well.\r\nKinuka: Are you sure that will convince them...?\r\nMirja: It would be wrong to get complacent, but I have faith in Nakano Jun. I'm almost certain I can prove her effectiveness beyond what a more haphazardly organized squad could manage.\r\n\r\nOn the day of a fight against aradama---\r\n\r\nMirja: The plan is just as I've told you! Kitora Squad, spread out!\r\nKitora Squad Members: Understood!\r\nMirja: Nakano Jun!\r\nJun: Aye!\r\nMirja: You're the key to our strategy today. Use your okatana as freely as you like!\r\nJun: Sure thing; leave it to me.\r\n\r\nJun: Would hate to have you all looking down on me. Aradama-han, don't think... You'll be coming past! Nakano Jun! So easy!\r\n\r\nCommanding Officer of the Special Ritual Squad: Don't tell me... Kitora Mirja! You can't expect her to deal with that many aradama by herself!\r\nSpecial Ritual Squad Operations Planner: But look... She's managing to hold her own. Actually, she hasn't been pushed back a single step...\r\nKinuka: All by herself she managed to draw a line, and any aradama she lets through are easily defeated by the other toji.\r\nKinuka: After all, there's no need for her to attack or kill aradama herself. This is the most effective way of using her.\r\nCommanding Officer of the Special Ritual Squad: I don't believe it!\r\nKinuka: Oh, it seems to be already over.\r\n\r\nJun: Last one! Letting it on by!\r\nSuzumoto Hana: Taking care of it! Haaa!\r\nAradama: GYAAAAAAA!\r\nKinuka: Fufu, would you look at that~. That's the result of thinking your tactics and strategies through~.\r\nUraga Nao: Do you really think it's that easy? Most couldn't manage it. Something like that requires a lot of trust between everyone to work.\r\nNao: I know I wouldn't be able to support a lone guard like that. Frankly, I think Mirja's the only one who could pull off such a risky strategy.\r\nKinuka: Well, what's wrong with that! She's in Kitora Squad, after all!\r\nKinuka: So long as she's there, Nakano-san can be used to her fullest potential! Am I wrong?\r\nNao: ...Hey, Mizushina-san?\r\nKinuka: Ah, Nao-san, you're still in work mode, I see~.\r\nNao: Why do you... You keep sending unorthodox girls for Mirja to work with... What's your goal here?\r\nKinuka: Fufu, you know me~. It's all for my cute little sister's sake, of course!\r\nKinuka: I want Mirja's squad to get even stronger. To turn them into the safest and most capable place for my sister to join. That's my secret plan!\r\nKinuka: Anyway, I'm done for the day~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: What Makes Up Mirja\r\n\r\n???: Kitora Mirja-senpai!\r\nTomomu Niwa: Thank goodness I caught up to you! You forgot your phone in the briefing room!\r\nMirja: Ahh, I must have. Thank you, you've really helped me out.\r\nNiwa: And, um... I'm sorry! To see whose phone it was, I took a look at your background photo.\r\nMirja: I don't mind. You don't have to worry about it.\r\nNiwa: Ah, okay~! Um, there's something else I wanted to ask... Are the other people in the photo your family?\r\nNiwa: The one with the same hair color as you looked like your dad, and your mom seemed very pretty... And is that your grandpa by the furnace? He looks like a blacksmith!\r\nMirja: Yes, my grandfather makes a living in Kyoto as a swordsmith. My father is from Finland, however... He admired Japanese swords so much that he came here to study under my grandfather as his apprentice.\r\nMirja: A lot of things happened and he became married to my mother, and those are my circumstances... You could say.\r\nNiwa: A Japanese sword family... I had no idea! Ahh! That's why you have the skills of a sword polisher, isn't it, Mirja-senpai? Does that mean... Did you want to specialize in that?\r\nMirja: That was what I had planned on doing, however...\r\nNiwa: I don't believe it! Mirja-senpai's a sword polisher just like me! That's so cool!\r\nMirja: Now I'm retired from it. Though, my Jikkyuu Mitsutada was an Akabane sword I went through the process of restoring...\r\nMirja: When Mitsutada found me suitable, I saw the path of a toji open before me. Thanks to that, I am now simply a toji.\r\nNiwa: Hmm, Mirja-senpai, are you trying to convince yourself you don't regret leaving it behind?\r\nMirja: What do you mean?\r\nNiwa: No, I understand. Let's see... When I was in elementary school, I went on a field trip to Ooyamatsumi Shrine.\r\nNiwa: Ah, sorry to suddenly launch into a story about myself, but please listen. At the shrine, they had collected lots of rusted okatana.\r\nNiwa: At the time, I thought they could really use more help restoring those. On display in the corner, they had dozens of them lined up. Wouldn't that make you want to restore them to their former glory, Mirja-senpai?\r\nMirja: It would, but...\r\nNiwa: See! It really gets your sword polisher blood boiling, doesn't it? You can feel it too!\r\nNiwa: You'd feel like you have to polish those swords! After all, Mirja-senpai, I know you always carry a polishing toolkit with you wherever you go!\r\nNiwa: Once you feel that compulsion with fixing up swords, it never leaves you!\r\nMirja: I'm not so sure...\r\nNiwa: Then why do you keep that with you?\r\nMirja: ...Sigh, I can't convince you so easily, can I? As a toji, I do my best not to think about sword polishing any more, but...\r\nMirja: You're right. On the day I have to return my okatana to the Sword Administration, I plan on returning to my training as a sword polisher.\r\nMirja: To that end, while I may lack the time to improve myself, I at least cannot afford to let my skills grow dull.\r\nNiwa: I knew it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3:\u3000What's Got You in a Trance?\r\n\r\nMirja: Yes, the mountings of Shintougo Kunimitsu are a complete set, or so I've heard. For Kunimitsu, who specialized in daggers, to make a tachi, makes this an extremely peculiar item. Please handle it with the utmost care.\r\nNagasaki Sumi: ...Ah, u-understood! I'll take good care of it!\r\nSumi: (Which country is this assistant from...? She's so beautiful... It's making me really nervous!)\r\nMirja: We look forward to seeing you again.\r\nMihono: Thanks for coming by-!\r\nMihono: This is crazy, Mirja-san! Customers just keep coming in one after another!\r\nMirja: Everyone gathered to see the Origami family's tournament, after all. Toji from across the country have gathered here in the Kanto region. I'm sure none of them want to pass up this opportunity while they're still in the area.\r\nMirja: But then again, that girl just now was from Renpu, wasn't she?\r\nAoto Hina: Good work, you two. It's not over yet, but are you feeling worn out?\r\nMirja: Thank you for your concern. Due to my unfamiliarity, I fear I made a few careless mistakes, however I no longer feel the nervousness I did this morning.\r\nMirja: Though, it seems there are some people who don't feel such things in the first place.\r\nMihono: Wait, Mirja-san, do you mean me?\r\nMirja: No, of course not. More importantly, Aoto Hina-san...\r\nMirja: As you are not only letting us stay overnight, but also providing me with this unique experience, you shouldn't feel the need to thank me.\r\nHina: Aw, you're too sweet... No, you don't have to be like that, Mirja-san! You're already working for more than a hotel would cost, and you don't have to make it sound like a special experience or nothing.\r\nHina: More importantly, you seem like the kind of girl who can really hold her drink. Am I wrong, Mirja-san?\r\nMirja: What are you saying...?\r\nHina: No use hiding it! You keep up that poker face, but your eyes keep racing all over.\r\nHina: Like they just can't settle on any one thing in here.\r\nMirja: ...Asakura Mihono.\r\nMihono: Y-Yes!?\r\nMirja: I will take care of the customers. You should head into the back with the others and help Aoto Youji-san take inventory.\r\nMihono: Uh, okay!\r\nHina: Mihono-chan! If my pa's slacking off, give him a good kick for me! ...So now, Mirja-san~.\r\nHina: What's got you so interested?\r\nMirja: There are materials here collected from across the country. Guards, braids, hilts, scabbards... I can't take my eyes off them.\r\nMirja: Not just for okatana, but there are so many standard swords here as well. This is my first time seeing so many in one place. I feel deeply moved.\r\nHina: Oh! Hun, you've got a real eye for detail~.\r\nHina: You get it, you get it! Lately everything's been trending towards \"if it's not an okatana, it's not a sword\", but we've got an interest in plain old Japanese swordsmithing too!\r\nHina: Though the Sword Administration's got their thumb on most okatana, so most everything you see on the market is just made of standard steel. But these are real works of art, and they've still got their own value as weapons!\r\nHina: Hun, I wonder if you can handle your \"swords\" too?\r\nMirja: Is that expression common in your line of work?\r\nHina: Nah, just a favorite of mine.\r\nMirja: In truth, I think it's just as you've said, Hina-san. Among swordsmiths, the ones who made okatana have been remembered as legends, and have come to redefine the perception of a \"sword\".\r\nMirja: However, the modern swordsmiths who have retained the old methods have then breathed new life into the traditional steel of antiquity.\r\nMirja: All in all, okatana cannot come to replace all swords. From old to new, they still have an equal amount of merit. That is what I believe.\r\nMirja: However... With antique steel, polishing can only get so far... Ah, not to demean the capabilities of sword polishers, but I'm a little out of touch with the practice myself.\r\nMirja: To make myself clear, with those methods of polishing, it can't help but reduce the overall texture and thickness of the blade.\r\nHina: Hey, are you picking a fight with Hina-san, who's been studying sword polishing for 5 years now? Though I guess I'm still pretty fresh to it. Is it really that hard?\r\nMirja: I see, you too... No, in the end, I'm only lamenting the extent of my own private interest in polishing.\r\nMirja: It's important not only to bring out the beauty, but the highest sharpness of the blade as well. In that regard, I can't help but scowl when I come across a crack in the edge.\r\nMirja: ...I have to apologize. I may have been projecting too much, and for that I'm sorry. You see, in the past, I aspired to become a sword polisher as well...\r\nMirja: To tell you the truth, even my Jikkyuu Mitsutada was an Akabane sword I personally restored...\r\nHina: Whoa, really!? That's so cool! Let me take a look...\r\n\r\nMatsunaga Yurina: ...Excuse me.\r\nMatsunaga Yurina: ...Umm.\r\nMatsunaga Yurina: ...I'd like to buy something.\r\nMatsunaga Yurina: ...Hey, you two!\r\nMatsunaga Yurina: ...HELLO!\r\nMihono: S-Sorry to keep you waiting-! The two at the desk seem to be locked in a conversation, so I'll try helping you-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: The Great Orange Battle of the Kotatsu\r\n\r\nUraga Nao: May I ask something~?\r\nMirja: Go right ahead.\r\nMizushina Kinuka: Feel free-. It's so calm and cozy in here-. Nice to get away from the hustle and bustle-.\r\nNao: Why are the two of you in my kotatsu~?\r\nMirja: The answer is simple. After all, in this dormitory, the only one I'm aware of having brought such equipment in would be you, Uraga Nao.\r\nNao: Mmm, don't you think you could show a little more restraint~?\r\nKinuka: No way-. It's chilly out.\r\nNao: My castle walls have crumbled~\r\nKinuka: Now now, we wouldn't just impose on you like that. See... Ta-dah! Refreshments have arrived~\r\nNao: Oranges!\r\nKinuka: Well~? How do you feel now~?\r\nNao: Ahh, my stomach has already decided for me~ I can't ignore your offering~\r\nKinuka: With that, Kitora-san, our supply lines are secured.\r\nMirja: I'd expect no less from one of General Headquarters' experts.\r\nKinuka: Fufu, flattery will get you nowhere.\r\nKinuka: Oh, that reminds me, have you two heard about this? There's people in headquarters asking to reconsider the standard battle formations.\r\nKinuka: You know, how every unit in the Special Ritual Squad is based around the foundation of dividing roles into attacker, sub-attacker, and blocker?\r\nKinuka: Well that's based off the model the army's special forces use, which was originally thought up with guns in mind.\r\nKinuka: So there's a new wave of complaints coming up about how it doesn't really suit a practical situation for toji...\r\nMirja: But aren't things fine as they are now?\r\nNao: You of all people shouldn't say that, Mirja~. Doesn't your squad disregard the standard formation as much as possible? As far as I can tell, that doesn't add up~?\r\nMirja: That's where you're wrong. I simply adjust each toji's responsibilities to suit their strengths as the situation needs it.\r\nMirja: And you're one to talk about disregarding theory, Uraga Nao. You tend to favor a strategy of encircling aradama, don't you?\r\nNao: Because I know I can always win like that~. Anyway, there aren't many commanders as capable as you that can pull off your attitude in battle, you know~.\r\nMizushina: Take it easy, you two. Look, the point I was trying to make is~ Hmm... How can I make this clear?\r\nMizushina: Ah, I know just the thing! I'll explain it through oranges!\r\nMizushina: Ta-da-da-dah! First, I'll write \"attacker\" on this one, and on its flank goes the \"sub-attacker\"... And after that... Huh? Where'd I put the attacker?\r\nNao: (Chew Chew)\r\nKinuka: Umm, well, I'll just deploy another attacker orange... Uh? Now where'd the blocker go?\r\nMirja: (Chew Chew)\r\nKinuka: That's strange... Huh? I lost another attacker!? Ah...! Nao-san! Don't eat them!\r\nNao: I just can't help it (Chew Chew), when you put an orange in front of me like that (Chew Chew), it's hopeless~ (Swallow)\r\nMirja: Uraga Nao (Chew Chew), don't you have any self control? No matter how much you (Chew) love them, the explanation cannot continue \r\n(Chew) if you keep eating them (Chew Chew).\r\nNao: ...(Chew Chew).\r\nMirja: ...(Chew Chew).\r\nNao/Mirja: I can't believe you!\r\nKinuka: Hey! You're in no place to judge!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: What Does a \"Mission\" Mean to You?\r\n\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie-san, there's something I don't understand. When you and I turned swords on each other, given the circumstances, I did not think I was mistaken in doing so.\r\nMirja: More than that, however... At the time, I felt there was a definitive difference between you and I. No, between myself and all the others.\r\nChie: I think I get it... Mirja-san, what does a \"mission\" mean to you?\r\nMirja: My duty as a professional. Before, it meant leading my unit to success as a captain of the Special Ritual Squad. Now, it means guiding this investigation team in place of President Souraku.\r\nMirja: What of it?\r\nChie: To me, a mission is an \"ideal\". To grow closer with to those I'm working with and achieve a great ideal we all share.\r\nMirja: I don't quite understand the difference...\r\nChie: Does it sound too similar? Then... I supposed the difference is best expressed between \"To carry out orders\" and \"To want to carry out orders\".\r\nMirja: .....\r\nChie: For example...\r\nChie: To Mihono-chan, a mission means to defeat aradama. Well, not quite... \"To free everyone from being threatened by aradama\" is more like it. Regardless of what anyone actually orders her, that's the mission she'll assign herself.\r\nChie: To Kofuki-chan, a mission means \"to kill every last aradama\". That's also the same as her way of life. Because of that, I'm sure Kofuki-chan doesn't actually pay attention to what the mission specifies.\r\nChie: Kiyoka-chan has probably never been given a proper mission. She's said she's not even sure why she was picked to be a part of this investigation team.\r\nChie: Even so, President Gojou Iroha chose her to represent the Heijou Institute. Most likely because she has high expectations for Kiyoka-chan's skill with a sword...\r\nChie: Thinking that, President Gojou Iroha's unseen expectations most likely manifest as \"the hopes she will return having overcome her weakness\". So Kiyoka's mission is probably \"to at least be able to fight\".\r\nMirja: I see. They all... No, you as well, Setouchi Chie-san. Everyone aside from me acts in a way that seems very honest to themselves.\r\nMirja: However, I still cannot decide whether or not that's a good thing. Is the way I conduct myself really the best approach?\r\nChie: Who knows? At least, I can't answer that for you.\r\nMirja: ...You're right. This doesn't seem like something anyone else can answer for me. Perhaps what's most important is to continue asking questions...\r\nChie: But do things feel a little clearer now?\r\nMirja: Yes. I've come to understand more of it. This may have seemed sudden, but I am still a novice at this.\r\nMirja: As such, it seems I'll have to learn more from everyone about how they live their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/N8q9gtW9xcY\r\nValentines Part 1: Mirja-san's Unexpected Side\r\n\r\nMirja: I heard from Kohagura Ellen. \r\nMirja: Several small aradama escaped from them. They seem to be headed our way.\r\nSuzuka: Even though small aradama can only cause relatively little damage, things like this are bound to happen with so few of us to handle them...\r\nMirja: Yes, and from the public's perspective, they feel threatened regardless of the severity, which can be troublesome. Especially in this case, which is causing so much unrest.\r\nAradama: ...GYUAAAA!!\r\nMirja: They're here already.\r\nSuzuka: You take the lead in dealing with them. I'll be ready behind you, so don't feel that you have to force yourself.\r\nMirja: Of course, I trust you'll take care of whatever I leave behind! --Let's begin our attack!\r\nAradama: Shaaa...\r\nMirja: Don't think you'll pass me so easily! --And you too!\r\nMirja: Phew...\r\nSuzuka: I've gathered the chocolate and packaging materials the aradama left behind.\r\nSuzuka: Though, couldn't you have left some of the fighting to me back there?\r\nMirja: I was able to attack with all I had knowing you would be supporting me.\r\nSuzuka: You can be unexpectedly aggressive at times. How surprising.\r\nMirja: In combat, I bear in mind that I need to calmly give orders. However, I won't deny I do feel that way inside.\r\nEllen: Nice work, Hanahana, Mirja.\r\nEllen: Thanks to you two, we managed to finish the battle without much damage to the mall!\r\nYume: I wanted to get all of them... They were so weak, but they kept moving all over.\r\nSuzuka: You can't exactly tell an aradama to sit still, after all.\r\nMirja: You may be strong, Tsubakuro Yume, but working as a team allows us to reduce the risks of danger or failure.\r\nYume: But I want every chance I can get... To show how strong I am!\r\nMirja: I think that will and ambition of yours to be strong is wonderful.\r\nYume: Next time an aradama shows up, just leave them to me. I won't screw up.\r\nMirja: In that case, while it's necessary to adapt to the needs of every situation, we can form our battle plan around you, Tsubakuro Yume.\r\nSuzuka: I don't mind, but what do you two think?\r\nEllen: I don't have any problem with it either.\r\nYume: Then that settles it! You better watch me close~.\r\nMirja: Good. Now, why don't we return to the sweets shop. We also have a job to do there.\r\nYume: Before we start working, let's snack on some cake.\r\nMirja: Certainly; the cakes they make do have exceptional flavor.\r\nEllen: I see even you've turned into a big fan of theirs, Mirja.\r\nMirja: There's nothing wrong with having a sweet tooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nValentines Part 2: Mirja-san is Meticulous\r\n\r\nSuzuka: I'll compile a report covering the progress the operation has made and the chocolate and packaging materials found from aradama.\r\nMirja: That would be a great help. If we could find some regularity to their behavior, it would make dealing with them in the future that much easier.\r\nSuzuka: That's what I hope to accomplish. Though, all we can do is pray the analysis team can bring back good findings. Anyway, you'll have to excuse me for the time being.\r\nMirja: I'll start helping with the shop then.\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Oh, Ellen-san.\r\nEllen: Hey look, it's Kiyoka. What brings you here? Are you helping with the aradama too?\r\nKiyoka: Sorry, I'm not, I'm just an ordinary customer. I found out about this shop from how popular it's been online and in magazines lately.\r\nKiyoka: And since Valentines is so close... I wanted, um... To look at some chocolate.\r\nEllen: You're good with girly things, aren't you, Kiyoka. Will it be a present for the person you like?\r\nKiyoka: Ah, no... I-It's not like that, though I do admire them... This is for a female friend.\r\nEllen: I see. What kind of chocolate would you reccomend in that case, Mirja?\r\nKiyoka: Ah-! You look so cute in that uniform, Mirja-san!\r\nMirja: Thank you. I thought it might be a little too cute for me, but I'm glad to hear you feel that way.\r\nKiyoka: A chic ensemble really suits you, but seeing you in such a cute style like that, you can definitely pull it off too!\r\nMirja: I'd like to ask you about that another time then. But for now, allow me to make you some recommendations.\r\nMirja: First we have this chocolate ganache cake. The ganache is made using milk chocolate and cream, to give it a refined and pleasing sweetness that melts in your mouth.\r\nMirja: And here we have this layered chocolate cake, separated by framboise jam. From the sponge of the cake to the cream on top, the jam gives the chocolate a uniquely sweet accent that makes this a fine choice.\r\nMirja: As these are both in high demand, I recommend either of them. Though if you had something else in mind, I can propose something else.\r\nKiyoka: Mirja-san... You're like a real shopkeeper.\r\nEllen: And I should mention, none of that was from the manual. It's all Mirja's personal recommendations...\r\nMirja: I've been trying them during our breaks as well. Because of that, I thought I might as well use my experience to give a thorough explanation to curious customers.\r\nKiyoka: That's just like you, Mirja-san. In that case, I think I'll go with the chocolate ganache cake. You made it sound delicious!\r\nMirja: Thank you very much. With the chocolate cream, it would be best if you let the person you're giving it to know they should eat it as soon as possible.\r\nKiyoka: Okay. I think they'll be happy with this.\r\nKiyoka: Anyway, I'll see you later. Please do your best working both here and with your toji duties.\r\nMirja: Kohagura Ellen. It's about time you started helping with our work here too.\r\nEllen: You seem like you're having no problem taking care of things by yourself, but I'll go get ready~.\r\nMirja: (Whether it be as a toji or as staff of this cake shop, I feel that I've done a good job today.)\r\nMirja: No, the day isn't over yet. I can't let my guard down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/vrh9FfXuL1I\r\n[New Year's Mirja: Start] Mirja's First Shrine Visit of the Year\r\n\r\nMirja: As one would expect, there are a great number of people out for New Year's Day. Let's all take caution so that no one gets lost.\r\nYui: Okay! You got it, Mirja-san!\r\nMirja: ...I don't see anyone besides you, Yamashiro Yui. What happened to the others?\r\nYui: While you were talking, they all got swept away in the crowd!\r\nMirja: I see.\r\nMirja: There's nothing we can do if we've already become separated. I'll notify everyone to make their first shrine visit on their own.\r\nYui: So basically, that means I get to make my first shrine visit all alone with you?\r\nMirja: That's how it is.\r\nYui: Hyaa~! I'm so excited~!!\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui, I propose we take measures to avoid splitting up any further. Put out your hand.\r\nYui: Y-You don't mean...!?\r\nMirja: We'll hold hands.\r\nYui: Ahh, give me a second, give me a second pleaseee! I'll take my glove off right now!\r\nYui: Wh-What do I do about my hand sweating... Ahh, Mirja-san's hand, it's so rough... Wait, you're wearing a glove!\r\nMirja: Will you please wear a glove as well? Your hand will get frostbite.\r\nMirja: After you put your glove back on, we'll get in line to visit the shrine.\r\nYui: Wha-- You mean that line that looks like it'll for sure take an hour to get through!? You know that lovers always break up because of long waits in lines, don't you!?\r\nMirja: We came here to make our first shrine visit, so of course I do. And also, where did you learn that statistic?\r\nYui: From my own research!\r\nYui: And so, for the sake of our future together, we should go draw our fortunes first!\r\n\r\nYui: ...Mirja-san, isn't it kind of like we're on a date together?  Kyaa! I said it!\r\nMirja: Is the short performance over now? If so, let's draw our fortune slips.\t[The term Mirja uses, koshibai, literally small play, refers to plays that were too small to be performed in theaters and were traditionally held at shrines.]\r\nMirja: Hm, mine reads \"great fortune\". That's how it is then.\r\nYui: You got a great fortune, Mirja-san? Since I'm a fortune drawing pro, I'll do it too!\r\nYui: There-! ...Wait, \"great misfortune\"!?\r\nYui: Wh-Wh-Wh-What do we do about this, Mirja-san!?\r\nMirja: Calm down, Yamashiro Yui. At this shrine, they have an offering box where you can deposit misfortune and great misfortune slips.\r\nMirja: After doing that, your great misfortune is meant to turn into great strength.\r\nYui: I'll go put my great misfortune in the box right away!\r\nMirja: If you run, you'll trip and fall.\r\nYui: Don't worry! A toji wouldn't trip-- WAGH-!?\r\nMirja: Just as I was telling you... Yamashiro Yui, is your leg alright?\r\nYui: Mirja-san is stroking my leg...! Is this my great strength already taking effect!?\r\nMirja: What are you even saying?\r\nMirja: ...Achoo. It's getting slightly colder, isn't it. After you've deposited your great misfortune slip, let's go warm ourselves up some.\r\nYui: Eh-!? You're going to warm me up... Where are you planning on taking me!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[New Year's Mirja: End]: Prayer\r\n\r\nMirja: Sweet sake truly does warm you up, doesn't it.\r\nYui: It sure does-. Sweet sake sure does warm you up-.\r\nMirja: ? What's the matter? You're making a strange face.\r\nYui: This is where I want you to say something like, \"You're so much more charming when you're smiling\"!\r\nYui: You got my hopes so high-. You got my hopes so high-! You got my hopes up that we were going to do something a lot more intense-!\r\nMirja: I apologize then, for not meeting your expectations.\r\nYui: You don't have to apologize~! I already knew all along it wouldn't be anything like that~!\r\nMirja: Alright then. Still, this sweet sake is delicious, isn't it?\r\nMirja: Would you like another cup, Yamashiro Yui?\r\nYui: Hey, that's no good, Mirja-san! What are you planning on doing to me, making me drink this much!\r\nMirja: I'm not going to do anything, and this sweet sake is made from malted rice, without the lees of actual sake, so it won't do anything to you either.\r\n\r\nMirja: Now then, why don't we get in line, now that it's grown shorter?\r\nYui: Sure! By the way, did you know this, Mirja-san? When you pray to god, it's supposed to be better if you state your name and home address, then make your wish.\r\nMirja: Is that true? You're well informed, Yamashiro Yui.\r\nYui: There's something I want to be granted no matter what. Whether I have to ask a god or anything for help, I'll try whatever I can.\r\nYui: So that's why, I looked up a lot of things.\r\nMirja: I see. I hope that wish of yours is granted then.\r\nYui: Yeah!\r\nYui: By the way, Mirja-san, are you going to pray for something? I can't even picture you praying to god for anything.\r\nMirja: I have wishes I want to be granted too. What exactly do you take me for?\r\nYui: Eh, but you don't have any flaws or weaknesses, do you, Mirja-san? That's why, if I had to say... You're a beautiful robot girl?\r\nYui: Ah, that sounds perfect actually! Your eyes are shiny and all!\r\nMirja: Could you not treat someone like they're a robot?\r\nYui: I'm just kidding! More importantly, please tell me what you're going to wish for!\r\nMirja: For the investigation team to accomplish their duties.\r\nYui: ...That's not really a wish, is it?\r\nMirja: Ahh, you have a point. Thinking on it, rather than a wish, it might be more of a promise I plan to impose on myself. \r\nYui: I like that about you too!\r\nMirja: I have high expectations that the investigation team will be able to become an even better team.\r\nYui: She just kept going!?\r\nMirja: I hope that this will be another good year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Y6ff2yewfcQ\r\n[Halloween 19 - Mirja: Start]: Kaiju Mirja?\r\n\r\nYui: Mirja-san, are you going to be debuting on the silver screen!?\r\nMirja: Calm yourself, Yamashiro Yui. Do you remember before, when Itomi Sayaka appeared in that film?\r\nKofuki: Oh yeah, that happened, didn't it. It was that time with the historical drama thing, right?\r\nYui: If you mean that, I remember it too! Sayaka-chan was extra cute back then, wasn't she!\r\nMirja: It seems the director from then has made another offer.\r\nYui: So they've had their eyes on Mirja-san ever since then... They sure know their stuff.\r\nKofuki: What's she talking about now.\r\nMirja: No, that isn't entirely wrong... It seems that, somehow, they remember me from then, and made an offer.\r\nYui: See!\r\nKofuki: What're you looking all smug for!\r\nYui: Anyway, I'm 100% going to go see it, Mirja-san! I'll see it 7 million 7 hundred and 70 thousand times!\r\nYui: Actually, when are they filming it! I want to go watch!\r\nMirja: On Halloween day.\r\nYui: Halloween day!?\r\nYui: That's when I was supposed to go with Kanami-chan and them to their Halloween event...\r\nYui: Gununu... Do I go see Kanami-chan and Hiyori-chan in their costumes, or do I go see Mirja-san...\r\nMirja: I should mention, along with myself, Itomi Sayaka and Iwakura Sanae will also be performing.\r\nYui: Sayaka-chan and Sanae-san too!? B-Both of them are hard to pass up...\r\nKofuki: You're making a pretty funny face now, y'know?\r\nYui: How can I choose though!\r\nMirja: No matter how much you puzzle over it, I won't bring you with me. This is work.\r\nYui: I understand...\r\nYui: I'll wait with bated breath to see the precious sight of Mirja-san when the movie opens, and prioritize the event where I'll only have one chance to see Kanami-chan and everyone!\r\nMirja: That isn't what I meant... Though, if you can accept that, then it's fine.\r\nKofuki: Well, if that's how it is, then you'd better get your body in shape for it.\r\nKofuki: Here, eat these niboshi. Want some milk with that too?\r\nMirja: ...Why niboshi and milk?\r\nKofuki: If they're asking for you, it's cause they want you to play a kaiju, right? You've gotta be at least two meters for it then.\r\nMirja: Of course I wouldn't receive an offer to play a kaiju. ...I will be playing a nun.\r\nKofuki: A nun? That'll be a laugh.\r\nYui: That's not true! She'd look just perfect as one!\r\nKofuki: Well, either way, give it your best shot. I'll be looking forward to it.\r\nMirja: ...Yes, I'll make every effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Halloween 19 - Mirja: End]: Sister Mirja!\r\n\r\nOn the day of filming.\r\n\r\nSanae: We finally have to perform... It's nervewracking. I-I think I should check over the script one more time...\r\nMirja: Will you be alright, Iwakura Sanae?\r\nSanae: Ah, Kitora-san... Since this is my first time doing something like this, I'm so nervous my hands won't stop shaking...\r\nMirja: Nervousness brought on by apprehension?\r\nMirja: Though, knowing you, you must have prepared extensively in advance, didn't you?\r\nSanae: I did; I made sure to practice, and I memorized how to say all my lines right!\r\nMirja: In that case, there should be nothing for you to worry about. You'll do just fine.\r\nSanae: Thank you, Kitora-san... But, if I don't double check, I'll be too nervous...\r\nSayaka: ...The script.\r\nSanae: Th-Thanks, Itomi-san!\r\nStaff: We're starting-. Iwakura-san, Kitora-san, please be ready to go-.\r\nSanae: Ah... L-Let's get going!\r\nMirja: Are you not going to check the script?\r\nSanae: No, I'll be okay even if I don't.\r\nMirja: (Her trembling has stopped. Is she the type who grows stronger when it comes time to act?)\r\nMirja: Let's go, Iwakura Sanae.\r\nSanae: Yes!\r\n\r\nStaff: Alright now... Ready-, start!\r\n\r\nMirja: That sound... From upstairs...?\r\nMirja: (...Suspcious of the sounds coming from the second floor, I go to investigate. When I climb the to top of the stairs, next comes...)\r\nMirja: KYAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nSanae: Ahahahaha! For you to be so shocked, my mischief was a big sucess nya!\r\nMirja: J-Just what are you!\r\nSanae: What am I? Just a plain old cat, nya.\r\nMirja: You demon cat... I-I'll destroy you here!\r\nSanae: You can go ahead and try, nya!\r\nMirja: (Iwakura Sanae comes rushing in... I fight back with the candlestick I'm holding.)\r\nSanae: Unyaa!?\r\nMirja: It's afraid of the flames...? Then!\r\nMirja: (Throwing the candlestick, while she's frightened by the flames, I take the knife I had hidden...!)\r\nSanae: UNYAAAAAAAAAA!! I'LL REMEMBER THIS, NYAAAAA!!\r\nMirja: ... It ran away? ...What is happening in this mansion...?\r\nStaff: Okaaay, that's good.\r\n\r\nMirja: Phew, nicely done, Iwakura Sanae. Thanks to your performance, we were able to make a fine action scene.\r\nSanae: Not at all! It's because of you, Mirja-san, that I think I was able to act so well!\r\nMirja: Then, why don't we say it's because of the both of us?\r\nSanae: Alright! Ahh... Now that that's over, I'm feeling kind of hungry.\r\nMirja: In that case, once Itomi Sayaka's scene is finished, how about we go to eat together?\r\nSanae: Sure thing! There's a delicious mizusawa udon place close by!\r\nMirja: Mizusawa udon is the udon of Gunma, isn't it? This isn't Gunma, though?\r\nSanae: I looked it up beforehand, thinking it could come in handy!\r\nMirja: I-I see...\r\nMirja: (What exactly was she expecting to need it for... Though, Iwakura Sanae seems to be happy about it... Well, there's no harm in it.)\r\nMirja: Then, I'll be looking forward to it.\r\nSanae: Sure!

Why not go enjoy yourself with Asakura Mihono and the others?\r\nYui: No way, I'm not going back! I'll be there to protect your pale skin, Mirja-san...!\r\nYui: Until I rub sunscreen all over you with my own hands!!\r\nMirja: ...\r\nMirja: Anyway, because it's down by the river, the air here is cooler than I expected.\r\nMirja: And there's such fine weather today.\r\nYui: That's for sure, it is really nice out...\r\nMirja: ......In spite of that, it looks to me like you're struggling quite a bit?\r\nYui: That's because... I couldn't sleep much last night, and I didn't eat breakfast either...\r\nMirja: Honestly... Here, have this.\r\nYui: Is that ramune? Thanks......\r\nYui: PFHAGH!?\r\nYui: What's with this!? It's sweet and sour and bitter and solid and salty and sourly sour!?\r\nMirja: It's the ramune Ban Tsugumi gave me to combat the summer heat.\r\nYui: Kn-Knowing that it's Tsugumi-san's... I'm not surprised it's awful...\r\nMirja: ...It looks like it was a little overwhelming.\r\nMirja: Why don't we stop and take a short rest here?\r\nYui: Sounds great!\r\nYui: Mirja-san, since we're already in our swimsuits, let's go in the river!\r\nMirja: ......\r\nYui: Do you not want to...?\r\nMirja: No, it is what we came here for, so I'll enjoy myself as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Swimsuit 20 - Mirja: End]: A Short Rest\r\n\r\nYui: YAHOOO-!\r\nYui: Phew...

Given the season, perhaps they were Ayu?\r\nYui: You think so?\r\nMirja: You can also catch Amago, Yamame, and Iwana during the summertime. Though, I'm unsure if those fish would be in this river here...\r\nYui: We should've brought a fishing rod with us. If there were that many fish, we might've been able to go all out for our lunch.\r\nMirja: True, we potentially could have, though... As beginners, I'm not sure how many we would be able to fish out...\r\nYui: Well, forget about that for now; hurry up and come in the water!\r\nMirja: Alright then...

A spider!\r\nMirja: It isn't a venomous spider, so you shouldn't worry. It won't harm you.\r\nYui: That doesn't help! There's no maiden in the world who'd keep calm with a spider in front of their face!\r\nYui: Can I hug onto you for safety!?\r\nMirja: Absolutely not.\r\nYui: Looking around more, there sure are a lot of bugs... Eep!?\r\nMirja: We are out in nature, so that's only natural.\r\nMirja: Phew, that was a good rest. Now then, to continue our stroll.\r\nYui: You aren't getting in after all!?\r\nYui: You were just toying with me, Mirja-san~!

With a \"bang!\"\r\nMirja: Going back, what is this Nine Schools Competition?\r\nMayumi: Ah, that's right, you wouldn't have a Nine Schools Competition here.\r\nMayumi: If I say it's... a competitive magic tournament, does that make it easy to picture?\r\nMirja: Yes, that's easily understandable.\r\nMirja: Hm... With that magic, you would be highly beneficial when fighting against aradama...\r\nMayumi: Anyway, putting that aside, are you feeling peckish? It's about lunchtime, isn't it?\r\nMirja: You're right, now would be a good time for it.\r\n\r\nMirja: Oh, that's... Asakura Mihono with Shiba Miyuki.\r\nMayumi: They seem to be enjoying themselves quite a lot, though, I wonder what they're talking about?\r\nMayumi: Let's go see, Kitora-san.\r\n\r\nMirja: You look like you're having a good time, Asakura Mihono.\r\nMihono: Ah, Mirja-san, Mayumi-san!\r\nMayumi: What were you talking about with Asakura-san, Miyuki-san?\r\nMiyuki: I was just speaking a little about Onii-sama.\r\nMayumi: About Tatsuya-kun?\r\nAcademy Announcement: An appearance of aradama has been confirmed. Please prepare to sortie at once. I repeat--\r\nMirja: Aradama!\r\nMayumi: We'll lend a hand. Won't we, Miyuki-san?\r\nMiyuki: Yes, of course.\r\nMirja: ...That would be helpful.\r\nMirja: In that case, Shiba Miyuki, I leave you with Asakura Mihono. Saegusa Mayumi will be with me.\r\nMihono/Miyuki: Right.\r\nMayumi: Will pairing off like this be alright?\r\nMirja: While magic may not be able to exorcise aradama, Shiba Miyuki's magic is effective against them.\r\nMirja: Paired with Asakura Mihono, she should be able to cover for her, just in case.\r\nMayumi: You really are considerate of your kouhai, aren't you, Kitora-san. I had pictured you as someone more logically driven.\r\nMirja: Logically driven...? It's true that Asakura Mihono is a valuable member of our investigation team.\r\nMirja: Though, Saegusa Mayumi.

Then, when we next meet.\r\nMayumi: It sounds like Asakura-san and Miyuki-san safely suppressed their aradama too.\r\nMirja: Yes, though Asakura Mihono's strange excitement has me concerned...\r\nMayumi: You think she might have fallen in love with Miyuki-san's magic?\r\nMirja: That might be the case. Though, you were excellent yourself, Saegusa Mayumi.\r\nMirja: I didn't think that, just by having long range support, it would make such a dramatic difference in efficiency...\r\nMayumi: Would you try recreating it after you wake up from this dream?\r\nMirja: That would be difficult to accomplish. Multi-Scope and Magic Bullet Shooter.\r\nMirja: I believe this was only possible because of how skilled you are at manipulating the both of them.\r\nMayumi: Thank you for the compliments, Kitora-san.\r\nMirja: I meant it. That aside, the aradama interrupted us when we were about to have lunch just now.\r\nMayumi: They did; I'm famished at this point. Even though it's a dream.

Ahh~, now I don't know how I'll wait for the day after tomorrow~!\r\nKeiko: (Is this really fine...?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Race Queen - Mirja: End]: Day of the Unveiling\r\n\r\nYui: Mirja-san! Can I be next to you on the way there? You don't mind, right!\r\nMirja: Do what you want.\r\nMirja: More importantly, Morishita Kihiro. Let's go over once more what will happen when we get there.\r\nMirja: Firstly, as I'm in charge of reaching out to visitors...\r\nKihiro: Ahh, we lied about that.\r\nMirja: Huh?\r\nYui: Hey!? It's too soon to spill the beans!!\r\nMirja: ...Too soon to spill the beans. And what do you mean by that, Yamashiro Yui?\r\nYui: Well, uh, we didn't lie so much, Mirja-san. Loosely speaking, we do want you attracting visitors...\r\nMirja: Haji Keiko?\r\nKeiko: M-Me!?\r\nKihiro: Please don't glare at Miss Haji like that, Miss Kitora. She was saying we should give a proper explanation until the bitter end.\r\nMirja: ...Right, I think I have an idea of what's going on. Yamashiro Yui is behind this, isn't she?\r\nYui: Teheh.\r\nMirja: \"Teheh\" doesn't make up for this.\r\nKihiro: To give a perfectly crisp and clear explanation, we'd like you to be a race queen for us, Miss Kitora!\r\nMirja: A... race queen.\r\nMirja: So, what are you making me wear?\r\nYui: Ehehe! Take a look, Mirja-san! This is it!\r\nMirja: To sum it up... I wear this, sit on the motorcycle, and attract people...\r\nKihiro: As a staff member attracting visitors in the broadest sense, you're our billboard.\r\nMirja: ...\r\nKeiko: I-I'm sorry... We were actually going to hire a professional to do this...\r\nKihiro: You see, while building the motorcycle, my gen~ius instincts went and caught fire.\r\nKihiro: And, while remodeling here and there, we completely spent through our budget.\r\nYui: That's when I happened to hear about all this, and thought, why not ask Mirja-san?\r\nYui: With your bombshell body, there's no way you wouldn't look great in it!\r\nMirja: ...Unbelievable.\r\nKeiko: Um... Are you not going to do it afer all...?\r\nMirja: No, I will. I wouldn't turn you down after coming this far. I'm not happy about it, but all I can do is resign myself to this...\r\n\r\nCameraman: Excuse me-. Would you mind giving a look over this way-?\r\nMirja: Li... like this?\r\nCameraman: Thanks a lot! That's perfect!\r\nMan: Hey, check out the cowling on that bike...! The design, materials, functionality; they're all first rate.\r\nWoman: I can tell. And, the parts used here...! That's an interesting make, but what purpose does it serve? Hmm, I'd really like to find out.\r\nKihiro: Mmhm! Just as we'd planned, Miss Haji! Our motorcycle is the center of attention!\r\nKihiro: Now then! Let's hurry over and give our guests an explanation!\r\nKeiko: Right...! I'm very glad, that we worked so hard on this assignment...!\r\nMirja\uff1a (...From the sound of it, this motorcycle has incredible workmanship. That at least makes it worth me enduring the shame of dressing as a race queen.)\r\nMirja: (Though--)\r\nYui: Hey, Mirja-saan~! Could you look over my way too~! And be extra sexy for me, please~!\r\nMirja: (Sigh... Instead of guiding visitors, Yamashiro Yui is just enjoying herself. I'll have to lecture her thoroughly later...)"}, {"paste_key": "i9sMV7mU", "title": "Asakura Mihono Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/i9sMV7mU", "timestamp": "", "hits": "202", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G49bNBzXc8k\r\nhttps://youtu.be/datvCWUrKKc\r\nhttps://youtu.be/tSsi3HMt5qU\r\nhttps://youtu.be/EgIu3T30SHE\r\nhttps://youtu.be/fhciZ41akJA\r\nhttps://youtu.be/75s9LlmOAs4\r\n\r\n1: Asakura Mihono's Easygoing Day\r\n\r\nMihono: Yawwwn... Eh!? Crap! I'm gonna be late!\r\n\r\nSubara Rika: Morning, Mihono-chan~. You overslept again, didn't you? Your hair's a mess. You're usually so early on days with sparring practice though.\r\nRika: Even if regular classes are boring, this is why you keep getting scolded, you know? But personally, I think learning the history of toji and tamahagane, and the relationship between noro and aradama, is pretty interesting.\r\nMihono: Yeah, buttt...\r\nMihono: Ah! More importantly! How're things going with that Fujiwara Shinjo-kun? If you don't hurry up, some other girl might make a move!\r\nRika: H-Hey, keep it quiet, Mihono-chan! ...Umm, y-yesterday, I... Sent him a message.\r\nRika: And, so, we're going to start studying together in the library soon.\r\nMihono: Good for you! ...Wait, you two are childhood friends, aren't you? How are you only just now studying together?\r\nRika: Look, Mihono-chan. As the heir to a shrine, Fujiwara-kun is working extremely hard!\r\nMihono: I get that, but... Mmm, it feels like you two should have sealed the deal by now...\r\n\r\nMihono: Hm?\r\n???: A-! SA-! KU-! RA-! MI-! HO-! NOOOO--! LET'S DUEL--!\r\nMihono: Whoa! (Dodge!)\r\n???: UWAAAHH!\r\n*thud*\r\nNagae Futaba: Don't dodge! Fight me fair and square!\r\nRika: Fudaba-chan... There's nothing fair and square about sneak attacks...\r\nMihono: Geez, you're always all worked up. You'd be so much cuter if you'd just calm down... You're not getting any more popular like that, you know?\r\nFutaba: Huh...!?\r\nRika: Ufufu. You really like Mihono-chan, don't you, Futaba-chan?\r\nFutaba: I do not!\r\nHattori Tetsuo: Ah! I figured you were the ones making all that noise! If you aren't busy, they need you to help out!\r\nMihono: Ah, Hattori-senpai? Good morning-!\r\nFutaba: ...Gu-Goodmor... Ning...\r\nHattori: What, you two were fighting again? Try to take it easy. Wouldn't want to see either of you get hurt.\r\nHattori: Anyway, Asakura! You're getting called to action. Sounds like aradama showed up.\r\nMihono: Huh? Uh, you're right! Sorry, Rika! I gotta go!\r\nFutaba: Ah! I'll go too!\r\nHattori: You're staying put. For starters, they didn't call on you, and besides, you haven't been cleared for real combat yet.\r\n\r\nRika: How'd it go, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Somehow I made it through without a scratch.\r\nHattori: Good work. Give your Kiyomitsu to me; I'll do some maintenance on it.\r\nFutaba: Ah, Senpai! Um, ah... Err, m-my...\r\nMihono: Don't worry about it, Senpai. I didn't wear Kiyomitsu out too bad this time. And besides, its scheduled maintenance is pretty soon.\r\nMihono: But you should check out Futaba's Magoroku. She's been saying it's falling apart lately.\r\nFutaba: Ehh!?\r\nHattori: Really? Then come on, Nagae. I'll give it a look.\r\nFutaba: A-Ah... Thank you so much, Hattori... Senpai...\r\nMihono: ...... .........\r\nRika: What are you smiling about, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Nah, it's just... Kids these days, huh~?\r\nRika: ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: Her Mother's Okatana\r\n\r\nMirja: I'm sorry to take up your time like this. There's something I wanted to ask you today... About Asakura Mihono's okatana, Kashuu Kiyomitsu.\r\nAsakura Yoshizumi: I don't mind one bit, Kitora... Mirja-san, was it? Time's about all I've got left to give anymore. So, what's got you so curious?\r\nMirja: I have an ability... \"Kantougan\". When my okatana comes in contact with another, it lets me understand to a degree all there is to know about its background.\r\nMirja: Of course, it's not uncommon for two blades to come into contact with each other in a match, so...\r\nMirja: Anyway... In training the other day I was able to confirm it. Asakura Mihono's okatana is the very same Kashuu Kiyomitsu that was wielded by Okita Souji.\r\nMirja: Of course, there's the well known legend of that okatana... Of how, during the Ikedaya incident, the tip of it was broken off.\r\nMirja: However...\r\nYoshizumi: You don't think quite that much had been broken, is that it? After all, in that raid by the Shinsengumi, it was only the very tip that broke.  Hmm... You sure do know the history of that okatana well.\r\nMirja: As a general rule, okatana do not break. However, this would mark the second time Kiyomitsu has broken... What is the meaning of this?\r\nYoshizumi: To give you an idea, I'll have to tell you a story of that girl's mother.\r\nMirja: ......\r\nYoshizumi: Don't worry, it's not such a sad story. Her mother was a toji as well. That okatana, Kashuu Kiyomitsu, belonged to her.\r\nYoshizumi: It happened... About 20 years ago, on the day of the disaster. The unit her mother was in was cut off and surrounded by countless aradama.\r\nYoshizumi: I'm told it was a very fierce battle. At some point, the end of that unbreakable okatana, much like back in the days of the Tokugawa shogunate, came flying off.\r\nYoshizumi: The fragment that broke this time buried itself deep in Mihono's mother's chest, and could not be removed again.\r\nYoshizumi: She returned safely from the battle, but... No more than ten years after, she passed on from this world.\r\nMirja: I'm sorry to hear that...\r\nYoshizumi: Actually, the story doesn't end there. During that time, she had become pregnant with Mihono...\r\nYoshizumi: And it was no longer there. Under medical treatment, they searched again and again to try removing the fragment. But they couldn't find it anywhere in her body.\r\nMirja: What does that mean...?\r\nYoshizumi: You might have guessed... Mihono being chosen by Kashuu Kiyomitsu seems like no coincidence, after all.\r\nYoshizumi: Even now, that fragment may be resting inside of her... At least, I can't help but believe as much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: About the Childhood Friends (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: You wanted to hear about what we were like as childhood friends?\r\nKiyoka: Yes. I was wondering about you and Setouchi-san. Ah, and here's your \"Izu's 100 Famous Views Assorted Lunch\" and green tea, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: Thanks. But, there's not much to say about me and Chii-nee.\r\nKiyoka: Really? But among the five of us assigned here, you two just happened to be childhood friends. It feels almost like fate, doesn't it? Ah, here's your sandwich and warm tea, Setouchi-san.\r\nChie: Thank you. But to call it fate... It's more like, maybe... A punishment game? Isn't it, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: You heard, right Kiyoka? How I chased after Kanami and Chii-nee followed me. Well, President Ema got really mad and told us to work here.\r\nKiyoka: Oh yeah, that's right... But, but, I'm still curious to hear what you were like as kids together.\r\nMihono: Hmm~...\r\nMihono: Well, it was about five years ago that Chii-nee moved away from Okayama... I was just a third year in elementary school back then, and Chii-nee had just started middle school.\r\nChie: So you remember. Mihono-chan still acts mostly the same, but I used to be much more of a crybaby.\r\nChie: My house wasn't too far from the Asakura Shrine, and so we'd always play around at the shrine until it got dark. It was a lot of fun; we'd all go catching bugs and playing other games.\r\nChie: In the fall we'd eat baked sweet potatoes, and in the summer, the priest... Yoshizumi-san, would make us shaved ice. It was so good that I can still remember the taste.\r\nMihono: It's actually gotten a power up since! Grandpa makes his own jam and syrup for it now. He gets the fruit and ice locally too.\r\nKiyoka: Ah, I'd like to try that sometime.\r\nChie: Me too; it's been so long.\r\nMihono: Come on by, I'll set up reservations for two!\r\nChie: Ufufu~\r\nMihono: Ahaha!\r\nMihono: But Chii-nee, you haven't changed a bit! You've still got that onee-san feeling... Your boobs got bigger though.\r\nChie: Really? Well you've changed and you haven't, Mihono-chan. You still have that strong sense of justice, and you charge right into danger the same way. But you're taller now, and so much stronger, and you became so pretty.\r\nMihono: Ahh! Geez! What's the big idea, complimenting me like that!? ...I'll be right back!\r\nKiyoka: Um, where are you going?\r\nMihono: T-The bathroom...!\r\n*Mihono runs away blushing*\r\nChie: She didn't have to get so embarrassed about it.\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nChie: Welcome back, Shichinosato-san. How was the dining car?\r\nKofuki: Nothing special. Anyway, Mihono just ran by making a crazy face... What's up with that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: About the Childhood Friends (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Well, since Mihono-chan went to the bathroom, I'll say this... Actually, that sense of justice of hers has always made her a little reckless.\r\nChie: Like when Etou Kanami-san and Juujou Hiyori-san attacked the head of the family... She ran after them shouting \"I know there's a good reason for this!\" Honestly, as her onee-san, I wish she wouldn't act like that...\r\nKofuki: ...Like a moron?\r\nKiyoka: Well, I think it's nice how much she trusts her friend.\r\nKofuki: Huh? It's still dumb. There's no way she was getting through the elite guard and the rest of them.\r\nChie: Mihono-chan's actually pretty capable, you know? In the qualifiers for the tournament, she came in third.\r\nKofuki: Huh? Wait, she was Minoseki's substitute?\r\nKiyoka: Asakura-san is strong, isn't she?\r\nChie: That's right. But, ever since we were young, she's always had problems with... Concentrating, I guess? Her bursts of strength always wore out quick.\r\nKiyoka: What do you mean?\r\nChie: Our master used to say... Ah, when Mihono-chan was in elementary school, we went to the same fencing dojo together. Well, all the kids in the area went to some dojo.\r\nChie: Anyway, when Mihono-chan was young... She used to shock even our master with her skill.\r\nChie: Especially when she'd use techniques she shouldn't have learned yet, and she'd show a surprising level of judgment in what to use... But...\r\nKiyoka: But?\r\nChie: Strangely, it never lasted very long. Before you knew it she'd be back to her usual self.\r\nKiyoka: Isn't that sort of like a toji's abilities?\r\nChie: It was the same even when she didn't have an okatana, so I don't think so. As a swordfighter, when she didn't have that power, she was... Intense, yet average, I guess?\r\nKiyoka: So that's why she didn't qualify as Minoseki's representative.\r\nChie: But still, her sense of justice has always been strong... When she was little, she beat up some boys who were neighborhood bullies. And she sort of became their boss? Like joining Mihono's party?\r\nChie: And one time we ran into an aradama in the woods. Mihono-chan held it off while we ran to call the adults.\r\nChie: (Now that I think about it... Mihono-chan was always running into aradama, wasn't she? Almost like they'd gather around where she went...)\r\nKiyoka: It's weird to think of Asakura-san leading a group of boys around. I can't even imagine her doing that now.\r\nChie: I know, she must have changed after entering middle school.\r\nKofuki: Hey.\r\nKiyoka: ?\r\nKofuki: Didn't she just enter her second year? So I'm supposed to believe... Just over a year ago, she was some kind of brat gang leader?\r\nKiyoka/Chie: Now that you mention it!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Who Do They Like?\r\n\r\nNagae Futaba: U-Um, Hattori-senpai! W-Would you take...! A-A-Another look at my okatana sometime!?\r\nFutaba: T-Thank you so much...! It's a promise!\r\nHattori Tetsuo: O-Okay, sure... W-Wait! Uh, Futaba-chan, wasn't it?\r\nHattori: She's gone already though... Oww! Watch it, Asakura!?\r\nMihono: Uwah! It's him!\r\nHattori: Come on, don't treat me like that. I'm not an aradama.\r\nMihono: ...Well, I'm going then.\r\nHattori: Hang on. There's something I seriously want your advice on. You seem like the real gossipy type.\r\nMihono: ...What's that? You wanna inspect my okatana up close and personal?\r\nHattori: I'm just kidding!\r\nMihono: Buy me sweets in the cafeteria for a week. Enough for me, Kiyoka, and Fukki. Then I'll help you out.\r\nHattori: ...Fine, if that's what it takes.\r\nHattori: Anyway, lately I've been seeing this gentle, and beautiful, and nice smelling, and accepting, and big chested... Goddess around...\r\nMihono: ...You're already creeping me out. And why'd you stop and sigh while looking at my chest? You want to see my okatana that badly?\r\nHattori: Sorry, I didn't mean to! But anyway, I need your help picking out a present for her. Something that might make her want to go out with me.\r\nMihono: When you spring this on me all of a sudden, it's a little... Anyway, who's this \"goddess\"?\r\nHattori: She comes here from Osafune every now and then.\r\nHattori: Whenever I'm working support on the computers, she always smiles and tells me I'm doing such a good job. I'm surprised such an angel would be hanging out with you! No, she's a goddess!\r\nMihono: (From Osafune...? Someone I know?)\r\nMihono: (Wait, that's gotta be Chii-nee!)\r\nHattori: What's wrong? Should I keep going? I just need to know, you know... What kind of guy she likes.\r\nMihono: You mean Chii-nee, right? Just so you know, Chii-nee...\r\nMihono: Who'd have guessed! She's into younger girls!\r\nHattori: Wh... What...? So I never had a chance then...? Ahhhhh! Chie-saaaaan!\r\nMihono: Oh, he ran off... It was just meant to be a joke... But if he was going to get shut down that easy, he didn't stand a chance anyway.\r\nMihono: Still, to think Hattori-senpai would be into Chii-nee... That's too weird...\r\n\r\nFutaba: Hey, Mihono! You were talking to my Hattori-senpai, weren't you! Are you friends? Or... Don't tell me, you're going out!?\r\nMihono: Huh? Going out with who?\r\nFutaba: Don't! Play! Dumb! With! Me!\r\nMihono: Oh, you mean Hattori-senpai? Seems like he's into gentle, nice smelling, accepting, and big chested girls?\r\nMihono: Good luck, Futaba!\r\nFutaba: Huh!? What do you mean, good luck!? T-Though I'm still growing... Mm, I'm still growing... I'll... I'll figure something out...\r\nMihono: You'll be fine! Hattori-senpai likes girls that praise him too, so just keep it up and he'll be all over you... Probably.\r\nFutaba: Really...? You sure know a lot, Mihono... Wait, how do you know so much about Hattori-senpai... Wait...!?\r\nFutaba: Tell me! Is he your ex!?\r\nMihono: Why'd you think that!?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/datvCWUrKKc\r\n[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: Start]: First Mission as a Toji\r\n\r\n--This was at the time of Asakura Mihono's first assignment to suppress aradama.\r\n\r\nAradama: GGYAAAAAAAA-!\r\nFukuda Sawano: Ahem. Everyone, please follow my instructions.\r\nSawano: The aradama suppression will be carried out by the four high schoolers, including myself. If we work closely together, this will go smoothly.\r\nSawano: Etou-san and Asakura-san, you'll be making sure there are no people still in the area. If anything comes up, please tell me right away.\r\nMihono/Kanami: Understood!\r\nMihono: Kanami! Let's make our first mission a good one!\r\nKanami: Yeah! Let's go, Mihono-chan!\r\n\r\nGirl: Waaahh, Mama-! Where did you gooo-!\r\nMihono: There's a girl over here! Just hold on! I'll be right there!\r\nAradama: GAAAAAAAAA-!\r\nKanami: Eh? There's an aradama out here too? Oh no! It's going after that girl!\r\nMihono: I won't let it hurt her! Come on, Kashuu Kiyomitsu! DYAAAA-!\r\nMihono: No way!? It dodged!?\r\nAradama: GUGAA!\r\nMihono: Kyaa-!\r\nMihono: Ugh... I-I can't...\r\nMihono: (Th-This is bad...! That girl's going to...!)\r\nAradama: GAAAAAA!\r\nKanami: That's far enough! HAAAAH-!\r\nAradama: GUAAa aaa...\r\nMihono: Kanami's amazing...! In just one swing, that aradama...\r\n\r\nSawano: Etou-san, Asakura-san, you two did a nice job. It's thanks to your efforts that we were able to get that girl to safety.\r\nKanami: Ehehe, we got complimented, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Y-Yeah...\r\nKanami: Huh? Is something bothering you, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Nah, it's nothing... Sorry, Kanami, I'll catch up with you later...\r\n\r\nMihono: (It wasn't supposed to be like that...)\r\nMihono: (I wanted to fight to keep everybody safe and smiling... That's what I became a toji for...)\r\nMihono: (But, I'm just...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Ceremonial Dress - Misogi: End]: Where There's a Will, There's a Way\r\n\r\nMihono: (A few months passed since my first mission as a toji. Ever since then, I helped suppress a lot of aradama.)\r\nMihono: (But, while I watched Kanami start to contribute even more than all our senpai, like always, I was still useless...)\r\n\r\nMihono: Ah, Grandpa? It's me, Mihono.\r\nAsakura Yoshizumi: Ohh, Mihono? What is it? It's rare of you to call me like this.\r\nMihono: Yeah, well...\r\nMihono: They're giving me a three day break, so I was thinking about coming back to visit, since it's been a while...\r\nYoshizumi: Hm? Well, that would be fine...\r\nYoshizumi: But, did something happen? You're always saying you need to practice your swordfighting, so you're too busy to come home.\r\nMihono: Ahaha... I should've figured, Grandpa. I can't hide anything from you.\r\nYoshizumi: What is it? I'll hear you out.\r\n\r\nYoshizumi: The difference between reality and your expectations... That reminds me, you mentioned something like this before. With that girl, Kanami, was her name?\r\nMihono: Yeah... Kanami is just amazing. Whatever mission she's on, she always makes such a big difference.\r\nMihono: I thought I'd be like her too someday, but no matter how hard I try, it feels like I'm not getting anywhere...\r\nYoshizumi: I see... You're the spitting image of her, you know. Your mother.\r\nMihono: Eh? Mom?\r\nYoshizumi: Yes, your mother used to talk like that. That nothing was going like the way she imagined it. But whatever happened, \"where there's a will, there's a way.\"\r\nMihono: Where there's a will, there's a way...?\r\nYoshizumi: Your mother loved to say that phrase.\r\nMihono: She did!? Where there's a will, there's a way, huh... I like the sound of that, Grandpa.\r\nMihono: No matter what happens... You can do it! Don't give up! That's how it feels!\r\nYoshizumi: Then, you should try using it from now on.\r\nMihono: ...I will!\r\nYoshizumi: So, are you coming back home then? Do you already know the date?\r\nMihono: ...No, I changed my mind.\r\nMihono: I think I'll stay here and keep on trying harder! Where there's a will, there's a way, right!\r\nMihono: I have to become as strong as Kanami someday, so I can be a great toji who protects everyone's smiles!\r\nYoshizumi: ...Good, if that's how you feel.\r\nMihono: Yeah! Thanks, Grandpa! I'm going to go now, but I'll call you again next time, okay!\r\nYoshizumi: Right, you can talk to me anytime.\r\n\r\nMihono: Alright! I'll go right to the dojo and keep training! Starting with 100 practice swings! No wait, it should be 200!\r\nMihono: Cause where there's a will, there's a way! Isn't that right, Mom!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/tSsi3HMt5qU\r\n[Fairytale Mihono: Start]: Off to Wonderland\r\n\r\nMihono: ......I don't get it at allll. Help me, Chii-nee...\r\nChie: Okay, okay, which problem don't you understand?\r\nMihono: ...From here, to here.\r\nChie: Here to here... That's almost all of it.\r\nChie: Mihono-chan...\r\nMihono: Don't look at me like that, Chii-nee! I can't help it!\r\nMihono: Lately I've been doing aradama suppression missions, and expedition assignments, and I had to help with the escape room game too, remember? So I haven't had any time to study!\r\nChie: Even if you're sure that's all there is to it, you still make me worried...\r\nMihono: The one who's worried is me, cause I don't get any of this! At this rate, my summer vacation is in danger of makeup classes!\r\nChie: Okay, okay. That's why I'm here watching you study, isn't it?\r\nChie: Now then, first is this Japanese question. For this one...\r\nMihono: .........guh.\r\nChie: She fell asleep in the middle of the explanation!?\r\n\r\nChie: Wake up, Mihono-chan! We have to hurry to Wonderland!\r\nMihono: ...Chii-nee? Wonderland? We're done with the escape room game already...\r\nMihono: Eh, where is this?\r\nChie: Just how long do you plan on sleeping for, Mihono-chan?\r\nChie: We're going on a mission to suppress aradama in Wonderland, aren't we?\r\nMihono: An aradama suppression mission in Wonderland!?\r\nMihono: ...Are you tired, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: Okay, okay, whether you're feeling tired or anything else, just climb in that hole.\r\nMihono: That hole...?\r\nMihono: I have to go in here!? I can't even see the bottom!?\r\nChie: ...What's gotten into you today? If you don't go in that hole, you can't make it to Wonderland, can you?\r\nMihono: You're the one who's gotten into something, Chii-nee!\r\nMihono: If I fell down that hole, I'd die for sure!\r\nChie: Nobody's died going down there. You'll be fine.\r\nMihono: And who proved that!?\r\nChie: Honestly now, you can't go fussing over every little thing, you know? Now then... Have a nice trip.\r\nMihono: ...Huh?\r\n\r\nMihono: GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Fairytale Mihono: End]: Which Me is the Real Me?\r\n\r\nMihono: I'M-FALL-ING-DO-WWWN--!!\r\n\r\nChie: Good morning, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: EEEEEEE!?\r\nChie: ...Screaming like that just from seeing my face; are you trying to give me a shock...?\r\nMihono: That's cause! You pushed me into that hole... and I fell... Wait? Was I dreaming?\r\nChie: Honestly now, not being able to tell a dream from reality, it's like you're having the butterfly's dream.\r\nMihono: The butterfly's dream?\r\nChie: It's a story about someone who dreamed that they became a butterfly, then couldn't tell if they were themselves now, or the butterfly dreaming they were themselves.\r\nMihono: ......It sounds like a confusing story.\r\nChie: What it means is, the Mihono-chan who's here studying now could just be a dream of the Mihono-chan who's falling forever into that hole.\r\nMihono: Huh, that's weird......\r\nMihono: Why'd you know I was falling forever into that hole, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: You're so funny, Mihono-chan. Of course I'd know about that. After all--\r\nChie: We're on our way to Wonderland to suppress the aradama, aren't we?\r\nMihono: ...Huh?\r\n\r\nMihono: BGYAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nChie: Fufu, isn't this wonderful, Mihono-chan?\r\nChie: If you don't want to study for your exams, you won't have to anymore. You can suppress aradama forever in Wonderland.\r\nMihono: I don't want to do that either!\r\nMihono: Anyway, how far down does this hole go!?\r\nChie: Until you think about what you've done wrong Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Then, I did! I did just now!\r\nChie: Did you really?\r\nMihono: I really thought hard about what I did wrong!\r\n\r\nMihono: I don't want to be in the butterfly's dream anymore, Chii-nee!\r\nChie: KYAAA!?\r\nMihono: Chii-nee!? You're the real Chii-nee, aren't you!?\r\nMihono: Owwch! Ith not a dweam!! I did it, Chii-nee...!\r\nChie: Are you still half asleep?\r\nChie: Anyway, the butterfly's dream was the correct answer to the first problem. You said you didn't know, but you really did, didn't you?\r\nMihono: Th-That's not it! The Chii-nee inside my dream told me about the butterfly's dream...\r\nChie: Is that so, the me in your dreams taught you about it. Then, let's do the next problem.\r\nMihono: The me inside my dreams... Was that all it was? ......That really was just a dream, wasn't it?\r\nChie: What are you saying? Fufufu, you're so funny, Mihono-chan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/EgIu3T30SHE\r\n[Casual 20 - Mihono: Start]: Planning a New Year's Trip\r\n\r\nSeveral days before New Year's Eve.\r\n\r\nMihono: I can't take the local gourmet off the list after all, can I. But, I wanted to put the petting zoo in too...\r\nYui: Huh, what are you doing all by yourself there, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Yui, and Mirja-san too!\r\nMirja: That's quite a lot of guidebooks you have open. Are you going on a trip somewhere?\r\nMihono: I'm planning on doing an overnight trip on New Year's Eve with Chii-nee... And, I was checking what sights we should go see!\r\nYui: Two girls, taking a trip into the new year together... Just those words alone are enough to make your heart throb. Maybe I'll tag along too...\r\nMirja: Yamashiro Yui, that would be inconsiderate of you. And, if I recall, you have missions scheduled as far as New Year's Eve, don't you?\r\nYui: Ugh, you're right... I'm so jealous Mihono-chan and them get to take their New Year's break early-.\r\nMihono: Hang in there, Yui. I'll be sure to get souvenirs to bring back for everyone. \r\nYui: Souvenirs are nice and all, but more than that, I want to see lovey dovey photos of you two on your trip!\r\nYui: Please, help me get through my missions on New Year's Eve! Send them to me as you go! I'll be waiting for them!\r\nMihono: O-Okay, sure. I'll send them when I remember to.\r\nYui: If I can get some shots of two dreamy girls spending a heart-pounding New Year's tour together, I feel like I'll be able to pull through! You have to send them to me no matter what! It's a promise!\r\nMihono: Okay, I'll do what I can, but, what kind of photos do you want anyway?\r\nYui: Let's see... How about, photos of the two of you feeding each other food you bought on the train, like, \"Ahhn\"!\r\nYui: And then, photos of you staring deep into each others' eyes on the beach while you share your love, and photos of the two of you proposing in a romantic church deep in the mountains!\r\nMirja: I can't help but feel your suggestions are leading towards something other than a normal tour for two girls...\r\nMihono: Well, I was hoping to have something a little more exciting for us to do together, but do you have any ideas, Mirja-san?\r\nMirja: If you are planning a New Year's trip, a shrine visit and viewing the first sunrise would be standard suggestions.\r\nMirja: And, if time permits, it might be good to work in something slightly more original.\r\nMihono: Something more original? Like what?\r\nMirja: For example, rather than simply viewing the first sunrise on New Year's day, why not admire the setting sun on New Year's Eve?\r\nMirja: It's something I've considered for some time now. Everyone glorifies the year's first sunrise, but why do they pay no attention to the year's last sunset?\r\nMihono: You're right, every year things are so busy on the evening of New Year's Eve that I don't think I've ever sat back and watched the sun go down.\r\nYui: Yeah yeah, me too-.\r\nYui: But you know, if I were the sun, I'd be happy having everyone admire me on New Year's morning, but I think I'd want people admiring me on the last sunset after I worked so hard all year too!\r\nMirja: I've never exactly thought about how it would make the sun feel...\r\nMirja: I've always thought that those who can appreciate the sunset, the same as they would the sunrise, will get the most benefit from the year's first sunrise the next morning.\r\nMihono: I get it! I think that's a great way of looking at it. It might give us better fortune from watching the sunrise, so I I'll try putting watching the sunset into our plan too!\r\nMihono: Okaaay, now just to find the perfect place to watch the sunset with Chii-nee!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Casual 20 - Mihono: End]: At the Year's Final Sunset...\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Eve. Partway through Mihono and Chie's trip together, they happened to meet Kiyoka, Sanae, and Yume, and all went to watch the sunset from an observation tower together.\r\n\r\nMihono: Chii-nee, look, look! The setting sun looks so pretty!\r\nChie: It sure is pretty, isn't it. Ah, Mihono-chan, it looks like we can go out onto the deck from there.\r\nMihono: Whoa, the wind's strong out here. Chii-nee, be careful so your scarf doesn't get blown away, okay!\r\nChie: Right. You too, Mihono-chan; be sure your hat doesn't get swept off. Though, the air is nice and clear up here too.\r\nMihono: Yeah, it might be cold, but getting to see the sunset so clearly is the best! Oh yeah! Chii-nee, let's take a picture!\r\nChie: Another picture? You've been taking them nonstop ever since this morning.\r\nMihono: We're on a big trip together, so don't you want to have a bunch of things to remember it by? Kiyoka, could you take our picture with my phone?\r\nKiyoka: I don't mind, but, Hono-chan, with all the pictures you're taking, your phone must be running out of space, right? I'll take it on my phone and send it to you later.\r\nMihono: You will? Thanks. That's a big help-.\r\nKiyoka: Okay, Hono-chan, Setouchi-san, please come up with a pose!\r\nChie: Umm, a pose... What should we...\r\nKiyoka: If you want to give off a fun mood, how about if you do something like throwing both hands up in the air?\r\nMihono: Like this? Banzai-!\r\nKiyoka: Yeah, that's great, Hono-chan! Though, you still had your phone in your hand... Next, how about you stay just like that, but hold each other's hands?\r\nMihono: That might look good! Come on, hold my hand, Chii-nee! Yayyy!\r\nMihono: WAH---- What do I do!? I dropped my phone!\r\nChie: Eh-!? You mean right now, when we held hands?\r\nMihono: I think so. It's not on the floor here, so don't tell me...\r\nYume: You were swinging your hands all around, Onee-san, so I think it might've fallen all the way off the deck.\r\nMihono: No way...\r\nSanae: This observation tower is a hundred meters up off the ground too. There's a cliff below us, so I don't think it could have hit anybody, but if it hit the rocks down there, it would have broken for sure...\r\nMihono: I don't believe it... And I took so many pictures all day too-. Uuu... How could something like this happen...\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, sorry. This all happened because I got carried away and asked you to do poses.\r\nMihono: It's not your fault, Kiyoka. I was the one who let go because I wasn't careful.\r\nMihono: Sigh... For me to mess up this bad at the very very end of the year; my luck is the worst.\r\nChie: Don't look so sad, Mihono-chan. We might not be able to get the pictures back, but because of you, I've been having lots of fun all day.\r\nChie: All the memories are right here in my heart, so it's fine. Here, raise up your head. We can still make plenty more memories together from now on.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee...\r\nKiyoka: Ahh, the closeness between those two. It kind of makes you feel like tearing up, doesn't it?\r\nSanae: I know. That closeness itself might be the best takeaway from this trip...\r\nYume: Hey, hey, somebody's phone's been ringing. It's ruining the mood. Whose is it?\r\nChie: It isn't mine. ...Hm? Mihono-chan, isn't the ringing coming from behind you?\r\nMihono: Huh? Now that you say it, I think so. But, my phone fell down the cliff...\r\nKiyoka: Wait! Hono-chan, isn't there something in the hood of your parka?\r\nMihono: Whoa-! It's my phone! It didn't fall down the cliff; it fell into my hood.\r\nSanae: I can hardly believe it. But, isn't that great for you, Asakura-san.\r\nMihono: Yeah, and it seems like all my photos are safe too. Sorry for making all of you worry, guys!\r\nYume: Good for you. But, wouldn't you normally notice if something fell into your hood, Onee-san?\r\nMihono: I had no idea when it happened...\r\nChie: You might not have been able to notice in the panic after you dropped it. But, I'm glad to see you're back to your happy self, Mihono-chan.\r\nSanae: By the way, your phone has been ringing for a while, hasn't it? Who's trying to get a hold of you?\r\nMihono: Ahhh! Yui sent me all these texts!\r\nKiyoka: \"Where's those lovey dovey shots of you two you promised?\" \"The sun is already setting\" \"Hurry up-!\" it says. Do you have to text her back?\r\nMihono: That reminds me, I did promise I'd send her pictures of Chii-nee and me together.\r\nMihono: But, all I took were normal pictures of us having fun sightseeing, so it's probably not anything like what Yui's expecting.\r\nKiyoka: Fufu, in that case, I'll take one for you now. Hono-chan, hug up nice and close against Setouchi-san. Press your cheeks together too, and it'll look extra lovey dovey!\r\nMihono: I-I can't do that out of nowhere-! It'd be embarrassing, right, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: Well, it is a little embarrassing, but since we are on a big trip, it might be nice to have photos like this too.\r\nMihono: I guess so... Then, when in Rome! [hug-]!\r\nKiyoka: Yeah, that pose looks perfect! I'm taking the picture now. Say cheese!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/fhciZ41akJA\r\n[Dress 20 - Mihono: Start]: I Want to Throw a Thank You Party!\r\n\r\nMihono: Let's throw a thank you party for the Miss Five Traditions competition!

Karaoke, hm. I'll look forward to it.\r\nMirja: That's right, I'll have to tune my throat beforehand.\r\nYui: I can't wait to hear Mirja-san's singing! Let's sing a duet together!\r\nKiyoka: Are you only going to be inviting the investigation team?\r\nMihono: Since we're doing this, I want to reach out to Kanami and them too.\r\nKiyoka: It would be more fun with everyone going, won't it? I'll talk to Juujou-san.\r\nChie: Then, I'll ask Kaoru-san and Ellen-san. Tsugumi-san, can you speak to Itomi-san about it?\r\nTsugumi: Understood. I'll ask Itomi-san.\r\nMihono: Alright-, Kiyoka, Yui, Fukki-! Let's go do karaoke now! We've gotta build up our stock of songs!\r\n\r\nMihono: Wait, that was what we talked about, so why'd it turn into a party at such a fancy place!?\r\nKanami: I heard the elite guard and Yukari-sama found out about it, and it sounds like Yukari-sama decided to hold a great big party to thank everyone.\r\nMihono: Our karaoke meetup turned into a real party!\r\nMihono: Hey, Kanami! Since Yukari-sama did this, that means she had to have gotten some yummy food for us, right!\r\nMihono: Mmmm, I can't wait!\r\nKanami: I know what you mean, Mihono-chan.\r\nMai: Kanami-chan, Mihono-chan, it seems like they have dresses ready for us over there.\r\nMihono: She got us dresses too!? Let's go quick, Kanami!\r\nKanami: Ah, wait up, Mihono-chan!?\r\nMai: You don't have to be in such a rush you two; they have enough for everyone...\r\nMai: They're already gone.\r\nSayaka: Mai?\r\nMai: Oh, Sayaka-chan.\r\nSayaka: Kanami and Mihono were running. Did something happen?\r\nMai: Nothing's happened, you don't have to worry. More importantly, what did you need?\r\nSayaka: I came to get you.\r\nMai: Thank you.

There! It's all set!)\r\nMihono: Okay, Itomi-san, I'm going to get going too now.\r\nSayaka: ...\r\nMihono: Itomi-san? What's wrong?\r\nSayaka: I can't attach this necklace right.\r\nMihono: Necklace?\r\nMihono: ...Ah.\r\nSayaka: I'll be okay, so you can go, Mihono.\r\nMihono: Since I'm already here, let's go together. Could I see your necklace? I'll put it on for you.\r\nSayaka: ...Okay.\r\nMihono: Doing this much is no big deal. And besides, this necklace; it's cute, isn't it!\r\nSayaka: Thank you, Mihono. Your earrings are cute too.\r\nMihono: Ahaha, thanks! There, it's on!\r\nMihono: Okay, let's go!\r\nSayaka: Mm.\r\nMihono: Huh, did somebody come back? I'm coming-.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee and Mai?\r\nChie: I thought, if you were still getting ready, I could give a hand, but... It looks like you're fine.\r\nMai: You look like you're finished too, Sayaka-chan.\r\nMai: ...Mmhm, you look very cute.\r\nSayaka: Thank you, Mai.\r\nSayaka: Mihono put this necklace on for me.\r\nMai: I see; Wasn't that nice of her.\r\nSayaka: Mm.\r\nChie: So you were late because you were helping Itomi-san finish up.\r\nMihono: There was that too, but it's mostly because I couldn't decide what earrings to go with. What do you think of these?\r\nChie: I like them; they look great on you, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Ehehe, I'm glad to hear it then!

Though, it's a little sad we couldn't have everyone from the investigation team come along to refresh themselves.\r\nMihono: We can't always get everyone together at once. There's missions to take care of.\r\nMihono: But Chii-nee and Mirja-san'll be coming, won't they?\r\nKiyoka: Yeah. And it seems like Ellen-san and one of Mirja-san's friends from Ayanokouji will be joining us tomorrow.\r\nKiyoka: It would be even better if Juujou-san, Kaoru-san, and Kofuki-san were coming too; then we could hold one of our meetings-.\r\nMihono: You get pretty excited, huh Kiyoka... About doing stuff for the Alliance.\r\nKiyoka: Mmhm! After all, it's a lot of fun, getting to talk about fashion and beauty topics with everyone.\r\nKiyoka: I like being able to chat a little when we're all together after a mission too.\r\nMihono: Ah, I sorta get what you mean!\r\nKiyoka: And also, it gives me an chance to talk more with Juujou-san.\r\nMihono: Do you and Juujou-san talk a lot? Ever since she joined the Alliance?\r\nKiyoka: I'd already started talking with her a little because of a book. I lent it to her just a bit before the tournament.\r\nKiyoka: Though, back then, Juujou-san sort of had this hard to approach feeling.\r\nKiyoka: But she isn't like that at all anymore lately. She texts me casually too.\r\nMihono: So that's how it is-.\r\nMihono: Juujou-san's pretty interesting once you talk to her, isn't she.\r\nKiyoka: Yeah. She has a kind of uniqueness to her. I think she's really nice.\r\nKiyoka: That's why, I wanted us to get closer, so I was hoping Juujou-san might come along to the barbecue.\r\nMihono: Since you go to school together, I'm sure you'll have a lot of other chances.\r\nKiyoka: That's true.\r\nMihono: Anyway, the meat that I'm bringing tomorrow is some really good stuff, so you should look forward to it-. I spent a lot of money on it-.\r\nKiyoka: You went that far... You're serious about this, aren't you, Hono-chan.\r\nMihono: I'm going all out to have a good time tomorrow!\r\nKiyoka: That reminds me, they say chicken meat is good for breast enhancement, but, do you think it's actually true-?\r\nKiyoka: There's rumors that it's all made up.\r\nMihono: I'm not sure? Though, the meat for tomorrow is beef!\r\nMihono: And I bet it's not going to lose to chicken!\r\nKiyoka: Well, I'm looking forward to trying your meat, Hono-chan!\r\nMihono: The weather forecast said it'd be sunny, so it'll be perfect for barbecuing!\r\nMihono: Ahh, I wish it were tomorrow already-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Summer Uniform - Mihono: End]: Isn't Meat Best After All\r\n\r\nThe day of the barbecue--\r\n\r\nMihono: Okaaay, I think I'll grill up some meat!

I want to try grilling it myself!\r\nMihono: The barbecue boss should enjoy her own food!\r\nNao: Grilling it yourself is fun too, isn't it~.\r\nNao: Wait... When did I start letting the barbecue boss title slide...?\r\nMirja: It's the truth, so isn't it better this way?\r\nNao: Mirja, if you're going to be like that, I'm not giving you a taste of this perfect combination of baguettes al ajillo~.\r\nNao: Want some, Setouchi-san~?\r\nChie: It looks delicious; I think I will.\r\nMirja: Urgh... So your next strategy is to starve me out. I'll stop spreading the word of the barbecue boss...\r\n\r\nMihono: What should I do now~. Ah, skewers might be good!\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan!

Wh-What's up?\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, your meat was so tasty that we were forgetting something important!\r\nMihono: ...?\r\nKiyoka: Wasn't our plan to eat what Chie-san and the others were eating, to learn the trick to getting bigger?\r\nKiyoka: If we eat any more meat, we won't have room for anything else.\r\nMihono: Buttt... Everybody's eating meat, so maybe meat's the best thing to eat!\r\nKiyoka: That's...\r\nMihono: It's a good idea, right?\r\nKiyoka: I can't disagree with that...\r\nKiyoka: ...B-But, no. You almost got me, but, if meat is what we already have in common, then we have to try copying them with things besides meat!\r\nMihono: Ehh~... Ah, wait, hang on. Just the stuff I'm grilling right now then~... It'd be a waste otherwise!\r\nKiyoka: It's not good to waste food, is it.\r\nMihono: So you get it! Meat's definitely good for growing! Boobs are meat too, right!\r\nKiyoka: Then, let's quickly eat up the meat you're grilling now!\r\nMihono: Eh?\r\nKiyoka: Eat faster, Hono-chan... [chew chew].\r\nKiyoka: Mirja-san and Uraga-san are putting something on their baguettes now.\r\nMihono: Uh... Kiyoka? I think we should slow down and enjoy the taste a little more...\r\nKiyoka: Okay... It sure is tasty, huh!\r\nMihono: It's tasty, so let's eat it more slowly...\r\nKiyoka: We can't do that; if we don't eat fast, we won't be able to eat all the same foods.\r\nMihono: Kgh...\r\nMihono: A-Alright, Kiyoka! [chew chew]...!\r\nMihono: (Kiyoka... She's way too eager about Alliance stuff... I mean, sometimes she puts on too much pressure!)\r\nMihono: (All I wanted was to really savor the meat~!)\r\n\r\nChie: Fufu, look at Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan scarfing down the meat.\r\nChie: They must have really been excited for the barbecue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Very low quality video)\r\nhttps://streamable.com/bos4qz\r\n[Pirate - Mihono: Start]: Our Reward's A Treasure Hunt at the Amusement Park!\r\n\r\nAradama: GGGIII...!\r\nMihono: Ehh...

But, will Akira-san be fine on her own?\r\nYomi: She should be fine. Using cover, she drew the aradama to where they were manageable.\r\nMihono: Then, we have to beat the aradama here and get to where Akira-san is!\r\nYomi: ......\r\nYomi: You're right.\r\nMihono: We've gotta give it our best!\r\nMihono: --YAAAAAH!\r\n\r\nPark Manager: Thank you very much. Now we can re-open for business.\r\nPark Manager: As a way to give our thanks, once the others are finished clearing out the aradama, would you like to enjoy our newest attraction?\r\nPark Manager: It's based around a theme of pirates and treasure hunting; \"Treasures of the Pirates\".\r\nPark Manager: And there were nine toji who came here today. You can make three teams of three, so it works out perfectly.\r\nMihono: ...!!\r\nAkira: Nah, we're good. That's a real nice offer, but we've got work to get back to.\r\nMihono: Akira-san...\r\nAkira: ...Or I was thinking, but, if you're gonna extend the favor, we should have some fun after all!\r\nMihono: If we're in teams of three, we can just stay in the teams we're in, so we can play as soon as the mission's over!\r\nPark Manager: Then, I'll arrange for that. We would appreciate it if you would give us your impressions once you're done as well.\r\nAkira: That's a small price to pay. Thanks for having us!\r\nMihono: I'll go let everybody know! And help them out too!\r\n\r\nMihono: Good thing everybody was happy with it!\r\nMihono: Fukki and Inami-san got mad at me for picking the teams for them though.\r\nEllen: But, I do think it's simplest doing the treasure hunt with the same teams we fought aradama with today.\r\nHiyori: And it'd be annoying going out of our way to decide on new teams.\r\nEllen: We might be on different teams, but I'm glad I get to play with you, Hiyoyon. It's been a while since we got to do something like this.\r\nHiyori: Well... I am on the same team as Inami Suu and Kofuki. Can't say I'm not worried.\r\nEllen: I predict Hiyoyon and her merry friends will be a tough team to beat!\r\nMihono: Ellen-san's team with Yui and Kiyoka seems tough too, but we aren't gonna lose-!\r\nAkira: You tell 'em, Mihono. Let's go find that treasure for ourselves!\r\nMihono: Hmmm. What do you think the treasure pendants'll be like?\r\nYui: That's one thing to look forward to, but what I really want to see to is everybody dressed like pirates!

Besides the treasure hunt, it's going to be so fun fighting in pirate cosplay for the flags-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pirate - Mihono: End]: The Treasure Comes After we Take Down Their Pirate Flag!\r\n\r\nMihono: Wawah!?\r\nMihono: It's great and all I made it over to this ship without Kiyoka and them noticing, but... Bringing down their pirate flag is actually tough...!\r\nYui: Fu fu fu~. And what about you, Mihono-chan? You sure you didn't want to stop us from bringing down your pirate flag?\r\nMihono: Eh... Our ship-- Are Kiyoka and Ellen-san there already!?\r\nMihono: Wait... Nobody's there. Yuiii~.\r\nYui: If you take down our flag, we have to give you the treasure map-. So I'll tell a lie if I have to.\r\nMihono: But, that's not enough to make me give up!\r\n\r\nAkira: Me and Yomi'll take 'em head on, dealing with anybody coming off of Yui's ship.\r\nAkira: I want you protecting our flag, Mihono. If they take it down, they get to take our treasure map.\r\nMihono: Then...\r\nAkira: That's what I wanna say, but we're pirates. It'd be lame to just stand guard.\r\nAkira: So, a little after we start up, you sneak on board their ship and take their flag down. Then it's all ours.\r\nMihono: But, what happens if they get on board our ship?\r\nYomi: We can worry about that when it happens, is that right?\r\nAkira: Well, that's how we're winging it. Sounds cooler for you too, right, Mihono?\r\nMihono: Yeah! I'll sneak in and take down their flag! Leave it to me!\r\n\r\nMihono: I thought I'd get in all sneaky and bring your flag down though...\r\nYui: If that was... your sneaking, being a spy or a ninja really isn't for you, Mihono-chan.\r\nYui: I kept hearing \"Ahh!\" and \"Crap!\" \r\nMihono: No way~... I thought I was doing perfect though.\r\nMihono: But still, so long as I keep pulling the rope hard--\r\nAkira: That's it! Keep it up just like that, Mihono!\r\nMihono: EIIII---!!\r\n\r\nMihono: Even though we got Yui's pirate flag, we didn't have any time to look for treasure...!\r\nAkira: Suu's team found the pirate pendants first anyway, so we lost either way.\r\nEllen: With the number of people we had today, we couldn't keep up with two teams at once.\r\nEllen: If we had more people, I bet it would be twice as much fun-!\r\nMihono: Next time I want to invite Kanami and Chii-nee along.\r\nSuu: ......\r\nMihono: Though, even though she found the treasure, Inami-san doesn't look happy about it at all.\r\nKiyoka: From what I heard, it sounds like there was an aradama hiding by the treasure... Apparently it was a really small one though.\r\nKiyoka: And then Kofuki-san chased after it, leaving Inami-san alone in a dark model cave for a while.\r\nMihono: Ahh... Fukki... She would run off and leave her, wouldn't she. If she saw an aradama.\r\nMihono: Maybe I'll ask her if she wants to get something tasty to eat after.\r\nKiyoka: Mm, we should do that."}, {"paste_key": "j89zitGp", "title": "Setouchi Chie Episodes", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/j89zitGp", "timestamp": "", "hits": "153", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsqE0-j_osU\r\nhttps://youtu.be/UrOq6F25WZg\r\nhttps://youtu.be/ECgV1cc_IOw\r\nhttps://youtu.be/UMDuFWf-sOc\r\nhttps://youtu.be/FpDzSMNFIXE\r\nhttps://youtu.be/-FnEpWyIfT4\r\n\r\n1: Effective Applications of the Resource Known as Nene\r\n\r\nIn the research lab of Osafune Girls' Academy...\r\n\r\nWatanabe Emily: By the way, Cherry, there's something I want you to do for me.\r\nChie: Is that a new nickname? Cherry...\r\nEmily: Chie, Cherry, it's all the same, isn't it?\r\nEmily: Ahh, I almost forgot. Today's request is about that thing handed down through the Mashiko family. You know.\r\nChie: Thing? You mean Nene? He's always hanging around Mashiko-san. What do you want with him?\r\nEmily: Mm, first, take a look at this recording. 3... 2... 1... Begin playback!\r\n\r\nEmily: Well? How'd you like my camerawork?\r\nChie: I already know the answer, but... Are you always doing this stuff?\r\nChie: Filming the Special Ritual Squad like that is already breaking regulations, but... You're really bothering them by getting in their way to film while they're trying to actually work...\r\nEmily: ...Ahem. Now then, take a look at this part again. Mashiko Kaoru-san's okatana, Nenekirimaru, goes flying through the air.\r\nChie: She threw it, didn't she?\r\nChie: I'm more interested in why Mashiko-san was just standing around doing nothing in the middle of a mission, actually.\r\nEmily: More importantly, take a closer look at this analysis with a slow motion camera. Here you can see Nene pulling it along.\r\nEmily: It's not necessarily in the field my research team is covering, but... For an aradama to make an okatana fly like that... Don't you see the potential here?\r\nEmily: If we could reproduce the effects by lining an okatana's mountings with noro... No, if we could reproduce Nene itself through cloning perhaps, more toji would be able to make use of this flying okatana technique.\r\nEmily: Now this is where you come in, Cherry. I need you to go out and capture this \"Nene\"...\r\nChie: Emily?\r\nEmily: Of course, I will pay you for this...\r\n*Chie gives Emily a noogie*\r\nChie: Stop talking. There's no way I'd help you with something as horrible as capturing Mashiko-san's important partner!\r\nEmily: Ow ow! Grinding my forehead like that is off limits! Really! You're always so kind to your juniors, Cherry! Why won't you be my onee-san too!\r\nChie: ...We're in the same grade, you know. You're a little old for that.\r\nEmily: Now that you mention it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: The Girl Who Was a Crybaby\r\n\r\nChie: It's been a while, Yoshizumi-san.\r\nAsakura Yoshizumi: Oh, Chie-san. You don't have to be so formal. I don't mind if you call me Grandpa like you used to.\r\nChie: Then, Grandpa Asakura... It really does feel more natural. You should go back to calling me Chie-chan too.\r\n\r\nYoshizumi: I see, so you've been working as a toji at Osafune. Does that mean you've grown out of being \"Crybaby Chii-chan\"?\r\nChie: Please don't bring that up. That was a long time ago...\r\nChie: ......\r\nYoshizumi: Hm? What's wrong?\r\nChie: Maybe I haven't grown out of it. All I ever do is find things to cry about. I keep making new regrets.\r\nChie: When we were kids, Mihono-chan went to stop some older boys from picking on me, and she ended up getting hurt...\r\nChie: Even at Minoseki, it's thanks to me that she ended up fighting her friend... And it's all my fault she got wrapped up in this to begin with...\r\nChie: ...I'm sorry, Grandpa. I feel like... I have to apologize. It's all because of me that Mihono-chan is in this mess...\r\nYoshizumi: ...That's not true. Don't worry, Mihono got into this of her own accord. I have no doubt she would have gotten into trouble all on her own.\r\nChie: You don't know the full story! Mihono-chan did nothing wrong... She did the right thing...\r\nChie: I promised back then... That I'd become a better onee-chan for her, but...\r\nYoshizumi: ...Hmm. I might not know all that happened, but... I think you've become a bit too much of a perfectionist.\r\nChie: ......\r\nYoshizumi: Listen here.\r\nYoshizumi: There's nothing wrong with striving to be perfect. But people don't always expect the best from others. It might sound cruel, but that's normal.\r\nYoshizumi: Don't put so much pressure on yourself. If you want to be an onee-chan to her, then you should enjoy yourself while you're doing it.\r\nYoshizumi: I don't know what goes through her head, but Mihono... I know that, right now, being by your side makes her very happy.\r\nYoshizumi: So you should be happier about it too!\r\nChie: Grandpa...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: The Secret Behind the Ribbon\r\n\r\nKiyoka: By the way, I've been thinking this for a while, but that ribbon of yours is so fashionable, Setouchi-san.\r\nChie: The one I tie my hair back with?\r\nKiyoka: Yes, it's very stylish. I couldn't help but notice it.\r\nChie: As it turns out, Mihono-chan gave this to me.\r\nKiyoka: Asakura-san did?\r\nChie: Yes. It was a gift from Mihono-chan, when we were split up after I moved away from Gifu to Okayama.\r\nKiyoka: Really? That's so cute; giving a ribbon as a parting gift. I wonder what feelings she wanted you to carry with it?\r\nChie: Fufu. Actually, this ribbon was cut in two. Mihono-chan kept the other half. She wanted it to feel like, even if we were apart, we'd always be together.\r\nChie: That's what she promised me, but...\r\nEllen: Oh! You two! More aradama showed up! Let's get in formation!\r\nKiyoka/Chie: !!\r\n\r\nChie: ...That seems like the last of them.\r\nKiyoka: Y-Yes. I hope so. So, about what you were saying before... Do you think Mihono-san still remembers that ribbon?\r\nChie: I'm not sure? It wouldn't surprise me if she forgot.\r\nMihono: Eh? What's up? You're talking about Chii-nee's ribbon? Sure I remember!\r\nChie: !?\r\nMihono: Huh? Well of course I would; it's really important to me. I tied it to my bed back at the dorms, like a protection charm.\r\nMihono: We suddenly got pulled into this investigation team though, so I didn't have a chance to bring it with me.\r\nMihono: Wait, you mean you didn't see it when you were in my room, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: O-Oh, I, uh... Sorry, I must not have noticed~. Maybe I was just distracted by how cute your sleeping face looked, Mihono-chan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: Sing! My Fellow Toji\r\n\r\nMihono: Since everyone's got nothing better to do, let's start the karaoke tournament~!\r\nChie: It's not really a tournament, you know.\r\nSasano Miyako: And some of us do have better things to do.\r\nMiyako: Still, I didn't think the school had a karaoke room. What is this place?\r\nChie: They use this for school festivals. They let us rent out the latest equipment too.\r\nKiyoka: This sounds like fun. We haven't done anything like karaoke since we formed the investigation team.\r\nKofuki: ...Tch.\r\nMihono: Fukki's not getting into it... I wish Mirja-san could have joined us too.\r\nKiyoka: Being the captain keeps her busy. Um, here, you're up first, Hono-chan.\r\nMihono: I'm on it!\r\n\r\nMihono: Everyone's such good singers~. Miyako-san knows so many western songs, Kiyoka did all those trendy songs, and Fukki... Well, you just kept singing the same one over and over again. Four whole times.\r\nKofuki: It's the only one I know! You got a problem with that!?\r\nKiyoka: That only leaves Chie-san. From the start, all she's been doing is picking out songs for Hono-chan. Does she not plan on singing?\r\nMihono: Ah... You're right... I didn't get to choose a single song! Everyone else did it, so you sing too, Chii-nee!\r\nChie: Eh? Well, I'm... You know?\r\nKiyoka: Chie-san, I want to hear you sing too! Please sing for us!\r\nChie: Really? Well, if you're all asking...\r\nMihono: Come to think of it, I've got no clue what kind of music Chii-nee is into...\r\nMiyako: Well, you'll find out soon enough. A pro like her's about to put us all to shame.\r\nKiyoka: A pro!? Is she going to sing a really adult love song or something?\r\nMihono: Or maybe she'll sing jazz!\r\nKiyoka: Or something unexpected, like death metal... Ah... Chie-san took out her smart phone.\r\nKiyoka: She must already have a karaoke app. She seems really used to this.\r\nKiyoka: ...!? This prelude!\r\nChie: THE WOOOMAN~~ BY THE WAVES~~\r\nKiyoka/Mihono: Classical enka~!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Onee-chan Dismissal! Dismissed!\r\n\r\nMihono: Take this! Kamui!\r\nAradama: GYAAAAAAA!\r\nChie: Th-Thank you, Mihono-chan. You saved me...\r\nKiyoka: Setouchi-san! Are you okay!?\r\nChie: I'm fine... I hadn't even noticed one sneaking up behind us... Thank you so much, you two.\r\nMihono: You're the one who's always saving us, Chii-nee. But today we got to pay you back, right, Kiyoka!\r\nKiyoka: Ah, yes. I, um... I was useful too, wasn't I?\r\nChie: Mmhm, you're so strong, Kiyoka-chan. But I feel so safe with Mihono-chan watching over me. It's like you don't need my support anymore.\r\nMihono: Really!? We can take care of ourselves now! It's official!\r\nKiyoka: Th-That's troubling though... At the very least, if I could still stay in the back...\r\nChie: Okay, okay, you two have outgrown your onee-san~. Now let's clean things up here. Mihono-chan, you were scratched, so take care of that.\r\n\r\nMihono: Fukki-! Give me a bandage! A bandage!\r\nKofuki: Huh!? Use one of your own!\r\nKiyoka: Sorry, I used up the last of ours...\r\nKofuki: Tch, then take whatever...\r\nMihono: Thanks!\r\nChie: (They've really grown...)\r\nMirja: What's the matter, Setouchi Chie-san?\r\nChie: It's nothing...\r\nChie: No, it's bothering me. I thought I'd always be their onee-chan, but look at them now...\r\nChie: If anything, they're the ones protecting me now.\r\nChie: It was pretty arrogant of me to think I'd always have to look after them, wasn't it...\r\nMirja: I see...\r\nKiyoka: Ah! I found a bandage!\r\nMihono: Nice, Kiyoka! High five! ...Ah!! The bandage!\r\nKiyoka: It's rolling down the hill!\r\nMihono: Wait up, bandage--!!\r\nKiyoka: Ahh, stop, Hono-chan! That's dangerous! Be careful not to lose your footing!\r\n*Mihono falls down the hill*\r\nMirja: .....\r\nChie: ......\r\nMirja: ...It seems your duties as an onee-san aren't over yet.\r\nChie: Fufu... I guess not~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/UrOq6F25WZg\r\n[Swimsuit 19: Start]: Shirie\r\n\r\nKofuki: You've got a fat ass too, huh, Chichie.\r\nChie: ......\r\nChie: I'm sorry, Kofuki-chan. I didn't quite hear you just now.\r\nChie: Do you think you could say that again?\r\nKofuki: I said your ass is fat too, Chichie.\r\nKofuki: Is that what they call childbearing hips? What'd you eat to get it that fat, Shirie? \t[Much like chichi means tits, shiri means ass]\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan!!\r\nKofuki: What're you getting mad for!? I was just making a simple observation!!\r\nChie: This is one of those things you should keep to yourself!\r\nChie: I can't believe you. Can we please have a good time here without you saying things like that?\r\nKofuki: I'm having plenty of a good time though.\r\nKofuki: Anyway, you should try taking it easy, Chichie. Since we came to the pool and all.\r\nKofuki: You've been having a hard time, right?\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan... Thank you.\r\nChie: I didn't think you would be so concerned about me...\r\nKofuki: Yeah, yeah, dragging that fat ass around must be a lot of work.\r\nChie: ...Oh. Fufu, so that's what you meant, hmm?\r\nChie: And here your onee-san was proud of you for a moment.\r\nKofuki: Oh shit, she's seriously pissed! I'm outta here!!\r\nChie: Ah, hold it right there!\r\nChie: Honestly, she's so quick to run away...\r\nChie: ...Does it really look that fat?\r\nChie: Good grief, all this anger's left me feeling worn out. I'll rest a little.\r\n\r\nKofuki: That was close... If she'd have caught me, I'd get a whole lecture.\r\nKofuki: I'm not about to stand around while she chews me out in this place.\r\nKofuki: And I mean, her ass is fat.\r\nKofuki: Ah... I got it...!\r\nKofuki: Heheh!\r\n\r\nChie: There we go.\r\nChie: ...Hmm? I felt something strange at my waist...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Swimsuit 19: End]: Don't Make Others Angry\r\n\r\nKofuki: Crap, she noticed!\r\nChie: ......Kofuki-chan?\r\nChie: What are you doing there?\r\nKofuki: I was just, uh, interested in how these type of swimsuits work.\r\nChie: ...Is there anything else you'd like to say?\r\nKofuki: Your ass is just as fat as I thought!\r\nChie: That's more like you. They'll make fitting last words.\r\nKofuki: O-Oi, what's that supposed to mean, Chichie? My last...\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan? I hope you're prepared for this.\r\nKofuki: Wha-, hang on! It's just a cute little prank, right!?\r\nKofuki: Besides, it's not like you aren't wearing anything under the pareo, so you don't have to freak out even if it comes off!\r\nChie: ...Sohayanotsuruki.\r\nKofuki: Hey, you, wait, okatana are off limits, okay!? Where'd you even pull that from!?\r\nChie: A toji must always keep their okatana in arms reach, isn't that right?\r\nKofuki: So where were you keeping it!?\r\nKofuki: Oi... C-Cut it out!\r\nKofuki: GYAA----!!\r\n\r\nChie: Really now, isn't it time you learned there are some lines even friends don't cross? It's important to know right from wrong, Kofuki-chan.\r\nKofuki: ...I'm sorry.\r\nChie: And also, my butt isn't big. It's normal sized.\r\nKofuki: Nah, it's pretty...\r\nChie: Nn?\r\nKofuki: ...I'm sorry.\r\nChie: Have you learned your lesson?\r\nKofuki: Sigh... I shouldn't have done that, okay...\r\nKofuki: Ughh...\r\nKofuki: (I'll just stick to messing with her tits from now on...)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/ECgV1cc_IOw\r\n[Misogi - Chie: Start] The Torn Ribbon\r\n\r\nAradama: KEEEEEEEEE!\r\nChie: HAAAAAA!\r\nMihono: Alriiight! There's no more aradama around, so I think we're probably done here now!\r\nChie: ...Phew. Good work, everyone.\r\nKiyoka: No, please be on your guard! There's a reading on the spectrum finder!\r\nAradama: KUEEEEEEEE!\r\nChie: Kyah!?\r\nKofuki: I'm taking that aradama-chan!\r\nMirja: ...Musumi Kiyoka, are there any more readings on your spectrum finder?\r\nKiyoka: ...They're all gone. That was honest to goodness the last of them this time.\r\nMihono: Uu~, because I went and said that... Are you okay, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: It seems I was just a little more careless than I should have been.\r\nKofuki: ...Nn? Chichie, you sure about that?\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan?\r\nKofuki: That's not what I mean! It's just, you're acting kinda different than usual...\r\nKiyoka: ...Ah! Your ribbon! Chie-san's ribbon is torn!\r\n\r\nChie: ...Sigh.\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie's usual spirit is gone... Was it that much of a shock to her?\r\nKofuki: Guess even Chichie can get all depressed like that.\r\nKiyoka: It's worrying... Hono-chan, have you ever seen Chie-san like that before?\r\nMihono: Kind of. Way back when, Chii-nee used to cry really easy, and she'd get called crybaby Chii-chan.\r\nKiyoka/Kofuki: Crybaby Chii-chan!?\r\nChie: Just now, I heard the word \"crybaby\"... Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: H-Huh? Was that something I wasn't supposed to tell anyone?\r\nKofuki: Yo! Crybaby Chii-chan!\r\nChie: ...Don't you think you're getting ahead of yourself?\r\nKofuki: Yeah, yeah, that's how it should be. Chichie's gotta be mad if anything.\r\nChie: I can't believe you. I'm feeling fine now, so, this whole... crybaby, thing, just forget about it! Understand?\r\nKiyoka: But, still... That ribbon is important to you, isn't it? It's you and Hono-chan's...\r\nChie: That's right, it's very important to me. But... I can't stay moping around about it forever, can I?\r\nKiyoka: Then... Let us give you a ribbon, as a present! To thank you for always looking after us!\r\nChie: But, I do have other ribbons too... Sorry.\r\nKiyoka: Even if you have more, that's still fine! On the next day we have off, let's go buy one together!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Misogi - Chie: End]: Growing Treasures\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Chie-san, how about this ribbon? I think it would look good on you...\r\nChie: I do think it's fine, but... Don't you think it's a little too cute for me?\r\nKofuki: How about this one then? This one's not cute, which is perfect for you.\r\nChie: I'm not sure I like that last part, but... This is nice too. Though, don't you think it's too flashy?\r\nKofuki: You think? This's pretty normal.\r\nKiyoka: I think both of them would suit you fine.\r\nChie: Um... I suppose that's fine then, but...\r\nKofuki: If you've got something you're looking for, then just say it. We can look for one of those.\r\nChie: It's not exactly something I'm looking for, but... I'm so used to wearing my usual ribbon that it's embarrassing trying something else...\r\nKiyoka: But that's such a waste! Since we're here, let's try to get you a new ribbon!\r\nChie: F-Fine then. I'll... give it a try.\r\nKofuki: Still, I wish we had a few more people here to come up with something.\r\nKiyoka: There's no helping it. Hono-chan had something she had to take care of, and the others are all away on missions.\r\nKofuki: Well, no use talking about who's not here, I guess. The two of us'll have to come up with something that'll fit Chichie.\r\n\r\nChie: Thank you for coming out with me today, you two.\r\nChie: But... I'm sorry. In the end, I wound up choosing a ribbon with a design like the one I already had.\r\nKiyoka: Don't worry about that! It was fun picking out a ribbon with you, Chie-san!\r\nKofuki: I mean, if you say that's what you want, then it's fine, right?\r\nKofuki: That's what you're most used to, after all.\r\nChie: Thank you... I'll take good care of it.\r\n\r\nChie: Oh? Who could be stopping by this late?\r\nMihono: Good, you're still up, Chii-nee!\r\nChie: Mihono-chan? Why are you here? I thought you had gone back home today...\r\nMihono: Yeah, I just got back. So anyway-- Here, I got you a present!\r\nChie: ...A ribbon? Don't tell me... When you said you had something to take care of today, you were fixing this...\r\nMihono: Ah, no, that's not it. Actually, when I first got this ribbon, it came in a set of two.\r\nChie: ...It did?\r\nMihono: When you look that surprised about it, it's kinda awkward.\r\nMihono: And anyway, think about it. If you were going to split the same ribbon between two people, wouldn't you normally just buy two of the same ribbon?\r\nChie: That's... true, I suppose. But, if you had this, then... Why did we split one ribbon in two back then?\r\nMihono: I thought, if we did it that way, then you wouldn't forget about me.\r\nChie: ...Of all things. Even if you hadn't done that, you know I could never forget about you.\r\nChie: So then, you went back home to get this?\r\nMihono: Yeah. I'd totally forgotten where I'd left it, so it took me all this time to find.\r\nMihono: But... Chii-nee. This one's also the real ribbon from back then.\r\nMihono: Will you take it?\r\nChie: ...Thank you, Mihono-chan.\r\nChie: The ribbon I got from the others... And this ribbon too, and the torn ribbon as well... These are all my treasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/UMDuFWf-sOc\r\n[Railgun - Chie: Start]: Sightseeing Kamakura with Onee-san\r\n\r\nRuiko: I was thinking this seeing it up close, but, doesn't the Great Buddha of Kamakura seem kind of hunched over?\r\nChie: Now that you mention it, it is, isn't it. Maybe it's to make it easier for visitors to see his face?\r\nKazari: Ah, that sounds like it could be the reason why.\r\nKazari: What should we do next? There were other places I wanted to go see, but it's probably going to get dark soon.\r\nRuiko: Still, isn't it a little early to be heading back?\r\nChie: That's right, in that case, why don't we go get something sweet to eat? There's a place I want to visit.\r\nRuiko: I'm all for it!\r\nKazari: I can't wait!\r\n\r\nRuiko: Ahh-, that shiruko was so good. They went all out with the azuki beans. I'm a fan now!\r\nChie: The mochi was just the right size too, so it felt fine eating before dinner.\r\nKazari: The cream anmitsu was delicious too. If only Misaka-san and everyone were here to taste it.\r\nRuiko: Right-? I get the feeling they've been working a little too hard.\r\nChie: That's true. Let's buy something to bring back as a present for them.\r\nKazari: Sure! Setouchi-san, thank you very much for taking us sightseeing around Kamakura today.\r\nChie: You're very welcome. I'd never taken a good look at the sights here myself, so it was fun.\r\nRuiko: On top of that, you treated us to oden at that shop just now. Thanks a lot!\r\nChie: Fufu, it was nothing. Don't mention it.\r\nRuiko: The croquettes we tried on the way were tasty too; I'm really glad you came with us, Setouchi-san!\r\nChie: Sanae-chan is the one who told me, if you're going into Kamakura, you have to stop by that croquette shop.\r\nKazari: I see. So that was one of Iwakura-san's picks.\r\nRuiko: We'll have to tell her thanks later then. Anyway, to finish off our sightseeing, let's pick out some souvenirs!\r\nRuiko: What would be good-? It's gotta be something for everyone to eat, right? Since there's a lot of people, we should buy a variety of stuff.\r\nRuiko: It would've been great if we had gotten some of that shiruko from before as a present.\r\nKazari: I want to get some Kamakura Great Buddha candy and something else. Come to think of it, we've been eating different things all day, haven't we?\r\nChie: Isn't that fine? Savoring tasty foods is one of the goals of sightseeing.\r\nChie: But the shops might be closing up for the day soon, so we should hurry.\r\nRuiko/Kazari: Okaaay~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Railgun - Chie: End]: Lets Make Lovely Flower Decorations with Onee-san\r\n\r\nRuiko: I want to do something to thank her, you know? Not just for taking us around Kamakura yesterday, but for everything Setouchi-san's been doing for us.\r\nKazari: Me too. Though, I can't come up with any good ideas.\r\nChie: Ah, do you two have some spare time right now? There's something I'd like your help with.\r\nRuiko: Sure thing, whatever we can do to help! Right, Uiharu?\r\nKazari: Right! Whatever you need us for!\r\nChie: Fufu, thank you. Could you come with me for a minute?\r\n\r\nRuiko: Where are we going? Are we leaving the school?\r\nChie: No, it's only just in the courtyard there. There were some pretty flowers in bloom, so I wanted to stop by.\r\nKazari: Hmm. I'm a little curious in seeing what kind of flowers they have now.\r\nRuiko: ......\r\n\r\nRuiko: I was wondering what you needed our help with, but we're making a wreath of flowers for some reason!?\r\nKazari: Don't fool around, Saten-san. Let's make this properly.\r\nRuiko: You say that, but-. It's pretty hard working with flowers.\r\nKazari: You're great with sewing, so if you just do it carefully, you should be fine.\r\nRuiko: Fine, I'll get a little serious I guess-.\r\nKazari: Ah, Setouchi-san. What do you think of using this next?\r\nChie: Oh, that would be great. This is turning into a fine flower wreath with all the nice ones you're picking out, Uiharu-san.\r\nKazari: Do you think so? I'm just choosing the ones that catch my eye.\r\nChie: I really like this wreath we've made together.\r\nKazari: Ehehe... I'm happy to hear you think that.\r\nRuiko: Still, why are we making a wreath of flowers all of a sudden?\r\nChie: Uiharu-san's wreath is so adorable that I sort of felt like making one.\r\nKazari: ...?\r\nRuiko: Ah-, so that's what this is about.\r\nChie: And, I thought I'd give this wreath as a gift. The one we're making now, I think it would look perfect on you, Uiharu-san. The color combination, and the types of flowers we used.\r\nChie: I'd be happy if you're happy with that.\r\nKazari: ......\r\nRuiko: ...U-Uiharu?\r\nKazari: Um... Thank you very much. I can't let your kindness go to waste. I'll treasure it.\r\nRuiko: That's great-... I was worried for a minute there.\r\nKazari: ? What are you talking about, Saten-san.\r\nRuiko: Ehh-...\r\nChie: Now then, how about we make another one for Saten-san~.\r\nKazari: Sure~.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/FpDzSMNFIXE\r\n[Dress - Chie: Start]: Taking a Breather\r\n\r\nChie: Nnn...! They're finally done drawing raffle tickets-. I can take a break at last.\r\nChie: I wonder if there's any food left?\r\nEllen: Thanks for helping out, Chie!\r\nHashi Keiko: Yes, thank you, Setouchi-san.\r\nChie: You two worked hard yourselves.\r\nChie: I'm happy the raffle competition went off without a hitch. Though, Kaoru-san... It's too bad about her.\r\nEllen: That's just business as usual for Kaoru, so it's fine! More importantly, you must be feeling hungry, right?\r\nEllen: We went and got food just for you, Chie!\r\nKeiko: H-Here you go!\r\nChie: Thank you. I was actually starving.\r\nChie: An assortment of cakes from Ellen-san, and pizza from Hashi-san.\r\nKeiko: W-We didn't know what you liked, so we picked safe choices...\r\nKeiko:\u3000Ah, I made sure the pizza was good too. Like this Genovese here, or this cheese...\r\nChie: Hmm, are they? Let me have a taste... Mm, this sauce is perfect.\r\nKeiko: I'm glad you're happy with it.\r\nKeiko: ...Thanks for everything you did, Setouchi-san. I was very nervous, and... it's because of you I managed to do my job in the executive committee.\r\nChie: ...Mm-mm, I didn't do anything special.\r\nChie: And besides, if you hadn't been there, Hashi-san, I think we would have been in more trouble, like with setting up the stage.\r\nChie: It was a real help having you along with us, alright?\r\nKeiko: Setouchi-san...!\r\nEllen: Chie! The cakes I got are excellent too! These had to have been made by a first-class patissier!\r\nEllen: Hurry up and have some!\r\nChie: H-Hang on, Ellen-san... I-I can't eat that quickly!\r\nKeiko: U-Um, Setouchi-san, what foods do you like? I'll go get some.\r\nChie: Thank you. But, that sentiment alone is enough.\r\nChie: I'm sure they wouldn't have any hoba miso... And I don't think grilled fish would go very well with pizza, would it?\r\nKeiko: You're probably right.\r\nChie: I'll have the cake now, Ellen-san. ...Oh, this is tasty.\r\nChie: The cream's so fluffy... I feel like I could just keep on eating these.\r\nEllen: Yes! It's like it melts in your mouth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Dress - Chie: End]: Because I'm Her Onee-san\r\n\r\nChie: Phew... I think I overate a tad.\r\nMihono: Heyyy! Chii-nee!\r\nChie: Mihono-chan, and... Etou-san? Is something wrong?\r\nKanami: Ah, nothing like that, Mihono-chan and I were just going around trying the food on all the tables!\r\nMihono: Did you already eat, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: Yes, I did. Ellen-san and Hashi-san went and got me some pizza and cake to eat.\r\nKanami: Pizza and cake! They both sound good!\r\nChie: They were. I ate too much before I could help it.\r\nMihono: Ahaha, you're a real greedy eater like that, Chii-nee.\r\nChie: I don't want to hear that from you when you're the one still eating, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Ah, I guess you've got me there...\r\nKanami: ...Setouchi-san, you feel a little different when you're talking with Mihono-chan.\r\nKanami: Normally it's like, you're really adult!\r\nChie: We have been friends since we were little, after all. Though... Do I really seem that adult?\r\nKanami: When you're wearing a dress that sexy, you look way more adult than me.\r\nChie: I-Is it too much?\r\nMihono: No way, Chii-nee! You look really good in it!\r\nMihono: Hey, Kanami. You think we'll have that kind of sexiness in a few years?\r\nKanami: That might be... a little tough for us.\r\nChie: Come on, you two. Those dresses look nice on you as well, you know?\r\nChie: You look like proper young ladies.\r\nMihono: You mean it? Kanami, we're ladies now!\r\nKanami: Ladies... It's kinda embarrassing, getting called that.\r\nChie: And besides, you two will be ready to wear a dress like mine before you know it.\r\nMihono: Ehh, are you sure about that...?\r\nKanami: Though, when Setouchi-san says it, it sounds like it really could happen.\r\nMihono: You're not wrong... That's Chii-nee for you!\r\nChie: And what do you mean by that, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: I dunno? Ah, I guess cause you're Chii-nee and all, that's what I'd expect!\r\nChie: Because I'm me... Is that why? Well thanks, Mihono-chan.\r\nKanami: That's enough for you?\r\nChie: Of course.

It's part of a lecture I took that sounded interesting. Which is why I won't be there for the investigation team on the day of the exercise.\r\nMirja: I understand.\r\nMirja: Everyone's shown considerable growth lately. Even not having you with us, there shouldn't be any problems.\r\nChie: ...I'm glad to hear it.\r\nChie: (That gives me some relief, but... it makes me a little lonely too.)\r\nKiyoka: What is it you'll be doing for a practical exercise in a medical course?\r\nChie: It looks like we'll be acting as nurses.\r\nYui: Are you serious!?\r\nYui: Ah, I wanna see. I wanna see it so bad. Chie-san as a nurse; she'd be a real angel in white!\r\nKofuki: Huh? Like Chichie could ever cut it as an angel.\r\nChie: ...\r\nKofuki: She's more like a demon! A demon in white!\r\nKofuki: You've never seen Chichie get pissed for real before. You can totally see horns and everything.\r\nChie: Fufu, Kofuki-chan? Don't you think that might be the fault of the one making me upset?\r\nKofuki: See, look at her! She's freaky as hell, right!\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan? Get on your knees.\r\nYui: Look, that's what you get for making Chie-san angry.\r\nKiyoka: Yui-chan's completely right, Kofuki-san.\r\nYui: Forgetting about Kofuki-san, we all think you'd look great in it. Chie-san in her nurse cosplay!\r\nChie: ...\r\nMihono: Cosplay?\r\nYui: Yeah, Mihono-chan!\r\nYui: Must be so nice, Chie-san in nurse cosplay! I want her to nurse me gently inside and out!\r\nChie: Yui-chan?\r\nYui: Yes, Chie-san!\r\nChie: On your knees.\r\nYui: Why me too!?\r\nChie: Honestly now.\r\nChie: Mirja, I'm sure it won't be easy on you, but do your best looking after them.\r\nMirja: ...I know, I will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Nurse - Chie: End]: It's Alright\r\n\r\nSakura: ...I'm Hamatsuka Sakura, from the medical department. I'm glad to be working with you today.\r\nChie: And I am too, Hamatsuka-san. I'm Setouchi Chie.\r\nChie: It's nice to meet you... Though, this isn't the first time we've met, is it?\r\nSakura: Yes. I've seen you sometimes, at Ban-san's lab.\r\nSakura: Though, this is the first time we've had an actual conversation.\r\nChie: That's right.\r\nChie: As soon as you're done treating us, you always leave right away, Hamatsuka-san.\r\nSakura: ...I'm sorry.\r\nChie: Fufu, it's not anything you need to apologize for.\r\nChie: Though, I've always thought that I wanted to talk with you, so I'm glad.\r\nChie: No matter how small the injury, you always treat it with care, don't you, Hamatsuka-san? So I was curious what sort of girl you were.\r\nSakura: But, I'm not that...\r\nNurse: We're going to be starting the practical exercise soon. Please gather around-.\r\nSakura: Ah, the exercise is starting. We should go.\r\nChie: ...She ran away. Did I do something to make her not like me?\r\n\r\nPatient A: Thank you very much.\r\nChie: Not at all; please take care of yourself.\r\nPatient B: Excuse me, I'd like to ask something...\r\nChie: Yes, what do you need?\r\nSakura: (...She's amazing. So many people are just going over to Setouchi-san...)\r\nSakura: ...\r\n\r\nChie: Good work, Hamatsuka-san. That was nerve-wracking, with how unfamiliar I was with everything.\r\nSakura: You didn't seem that way at all. Um...\r\nChie: What is it?\r\nSakura: There's something I'm having trouble with...\r\nChie: Mmhm?\r\nSakura: ...No, I shouldn't be asking you after all. I can't go into much detail about it...\r\nChie: (Was what's bothering her the reason she avoided me before?)\r\nChie: ...You said you're having trouble with something, but, do you know exactly what it is?\r\nSakura: ...I do.\r\nChie: (If I had to guess... She's avoiding getting involved with other people? But, she's trying to talk about it with me...)\r\nChie: You'll be alright.\r\nSakura: Eh?\r\nChie: You're a kind and earnest girl, Hamatsuka-san.

Recorded by Ban Tsugumi.\r\n\r\nToday, at 13:00, Shichinosato Kofuki entered the research lab. I was running late from a lesson, and when I entered the labroom I could tell something was amiss.\r\n\r\nFrom what I gathered from my colleagues, for an unexplained reason, Shichinosato Kofuki was in an unusually rough mood. I wasn't quite sure how to approach the situation.\r\n\r\nMy colleagues made such comments as \"When grins like that, I feel like I'll be her next victim\", and \"If the higher-ups find out, we'll be in trouble\", and \"We're going to die\".\r\n\r\nBut, as far as I could see, the subject wasn't behaving any different than usual.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, and because I am the one who has made the most direct contact with Shichinosato Kofuki, my colleagues requested that I attempt to pacify her.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Now then, Shichinosato-san, today we have six A- grade aradama for processing from lab 4. Each specimen has particular characteristics involving the surface composition of their bodies.\r\nTsugumi: They've asked us to experiment with the angle you cut through them with your okatana, so please look over the order sheet for the specifics. After that, let's get to it!\r\nKofuki: ...Sure.\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Good work. By the way, you seem to be in an unusually good mood today... Did something nice happen?\r\nKofuki: Yeah! I had a good dream!\r\nTsugumi: A dream? That sounds nice. Were you on a date with the one you like or something?\r\nKofuki: Huh? Don't talk stupid. A good dream's more like... C'mon, you know what I mean!\r\nKofuki: Like where I get to slaughter lots of aradama-chan, of course!\r\nTsugumi: Of course it was-. But I knew that already-.\r\nKofuki: I was downtown... And it was like the world was covered in aradama. I'd cut one and keep cutting 'em and they'd just keep popping out; every time one of them died two more would take its place! More and more and more!\r\nKofuki: It was too good! I got to kill as many as I wanted! Just me and aradama-chan!\r\nKofuki: Ahhh, man! I can't take it anymore! You know what I mean, right!\r\nTsugumi: No, you lost me right away.\r\nTsugumi: But I'm relieved to see you're your usual self. Since you're in a good mood, why not keep up this pace? Seize the day, right!\r\nKofuki: You know it!\r\n\r\n--Progress report from research lab 8, in charge of subject Shichinosato Kofuki. Recorded by Ban Tsugumi.\r\n\r\nToday, Shichinosato Kofuki was in high spirits. When the subject was asked why, the reason given was that she had seen a very good dream.\r\n\r\nAs far as the details of the dream go, I see nothing of concern. They diverge greatly from what would be considered normal for a girl her age, but it was exceedingly typical for her disposition.\r\n\r\nIn addition, from now on, I would like to review all reports being made on subject Shichinosato Kofuki before they are submitted.\r\n\r\nThat is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: No Matter What, I Love Aradama!\r\n\r\nIn April--\r\n\r\nVoice: Why not study Kurama-ryu! Founded by the famous Minamoto no Yoshitsune-! Sounds cool, doesn't it! Come on over and change your image!\r\nKofuki: Tch! It's that time again when everyone's out recruiting the new students...\r\nKofuki: Year after year, they're annoying as hell. I've gotta get to the research building.\r\nKofuki: Just wanna play with aradama-chan already...\r\n???: H-Hey, you!\r\nKofuki: Huh?\r\nTamaki Marie: I-I'm Tamaki Marie, a toji in the first year of the high school branch.\u3000If you haven't decided on a research discipline yet, feel free to join me in learning Hokushin Itto-ryu...\r\nKofuki: Get lost...\r\nMarie: Huh!?\r\n\r\nWatanuki Kazumi: You there, you're a new student in the middle school branch, aren't you? How would you like to learn the ways of Satsuma Jigen-ryu?\r\nKazumi: It requires much more dedication to training than any other style, but no other sword will be able to match your gallantry...\r\nKofuki: ...I'm a third year.\r\n\r\nNagasaki Sumi: U-Um...\r\nKofuki: Seriously? Another one of you?\r\nSumi: Y-You're a first year too, aren't you? I just joined here, and I'm having trouble finding the dojo, so...\r\nSumi: Please, could we go there together?\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nSumi: Also, I haven't made any friends yet, so... Ah, and if you like, do you want to learn Jiken Shinkage-ryu together...\r\nKofuki: Get it through your head already! I'm a third year!\r\nSumi: Y-You're my senpai!? S-S-S-Sorry!\r\n\r\n???: Kofukicchi~!\r\nKofuki: Go to hell! I said I'm a third yea... Oh, it's you.\r\nFujimaki Minaki: Hm~, what's wrong?\r\nMinaki: !\r\nMinaki: Ohh! I bet you got mistaken for a first year again, cause you're so tiny! Poor little Kofukicchi!\r\nKofuki: And it just keeps coming.\r\nMinaki: Good job pulling through~. Here, I brought some milk for you.\r\nKofuki: Ooh, I'll take it. Thanks.............. (Gulp)\r\nMinaki: Mmmm, you're so small and cute, Kofukkichi~. (Rub rub)\r\nKofuki: ...You're as bad as the rest!\r\n\r\nInside the research building of Renpu Girls' School, in the aradama processing facility--\r\n\r\nKofuki: Where's the next one! Why's the next aradama-chan not in here yet!?\r\nTsugumi: What's the matter? You're in a bad temper today.\r\nKofuki: Shut up! Fuck! Everyone keeps treating me like a little kid! Aradama-chan's the only one who gets what I want!\r\nKofuki: Ahhh, damnit! I love you! Aradama-chan!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: Punkish Girl\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Kofuki-san! Kofuki-san!\r\nKofuki: Tch, the sun's barely up and you're already bugging me. What do you want?\r\nKiyoka: S-Sorry. It's just... There's something I wanted to ask you...\r\nKiyoka: Earlier, Hono-chan and I were talking about what kind of normal clothes everyone wears. So, Kofuki-san, what do you wear when you're not in your uniform?\r\nKofuki: Ahh...\u3000Then bring me one of those fashion books you've always got piled up on your desk.\r\nKofuki: I just pick out whatever though, so don't expect much... Let's see.\r\nMihono: Hm? What's up? Ah! You asked about Fukki's fashion? I'm so curious!\r\nKiyoka: I know, right?\r\nKofuki: Uhh... The stuff I wear is like... This, and this...\r\nKiyoka: So it really is like the hoodie you usually wear.\r\nKofuki: Stuff like this too...\r\nMihono: A biker jacket too...? I didn't peg you for it, but I guess you're the cool type?\r\nKiyoka: It seems like it. With that matching undershirt, it'd look really good... These are all clothes I could never wear though...\r\nKofuki: Oh! These short pants look good... Geh, these are way too expensive though...\r\nKiyoka: Hono-chan, Kofuki-san's fashion level is actually really high...\r\nMihono: Yep. She's really fashion-conscious...\r\nKofuki: ...And I guess that's it.\r\nKiyoka: I get it now. Kofuki-san's style is boyish and punk fashion. Where do you usually do your shopping?\r\nKofuki: Huh? I just buy something if it catches my eye while I'm out. Don't have any favorite shops or anything. So wait, this stuff is called punk?\r\nKiyoka: Y-You didn't know that!?\r\n\r\nAnother day...\r\n\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan, let's go shopping in town together. Everyone's picking out clothing today.\r\nKofuki: Huhh? Go do it yourselves!\r\nChie: Well, you see...\r\nMihono: C'mon, Fukki! Come pick out some clothes for me!\r\nKiyoka: Yes! I want to pick up some of your fashion sense, Kofuki-san!\r\nChie: ...That's how it is.\r\nKofuki: Ahh...\r\nChie: So then, are you coming?\r\nKofuki: You're such a pain! Man... Fine, I'll go! I'm going, okay!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4: What's Tasty?\r\n\r\nKofuki: ...Can't believe you dragged me out just for ice cream. Oi, Mihocchi.\r\nMihono: Ehh, what's wrong with that, Fukki? We all finally agreed to go out and eat together, and now you're acting all stubborn about it.\r\nKofuki: Look... In the end, food's just...\r\nMihono: Oh, I know.\r\nMihono: \"Oi, Mihocchi. Food's all the same after it's in your stomach. Doesn't matter what it's like going in. If I don't get to kill some aradama, then I don't give a crap about whatever you wanna do.\"\r\nMihono: ...You were gonna say something like that, right?\r\nMihono: Just come eat with us! The ice cream here is super tasty, you know?\r\nChie: She's right. Come on, Kofuki-chan, pick a flavor!\r\nKofuki: Tch!\r\nEmployee: If you're not sure, we'll let you do a taste test! I recommend our limited time \"Cherry & Vanilla Blend\"! Try some!\r\nKofuki: O-Okay...\r\n\r\nMihono: Fukki... I don't care how much you liked it, you're not going to be able to eat all that...\r\nMihono: I mean, they actually filled a whole bucket for you. I don't think those are meant for just one person?\r\nKofuki: ...Back off! You can't have any!\r\nChie: Fufu, but just look how happy she is. Let's just let her enjoy it~.\r\n\r\n--Half a month later.\r\n\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan! We're all going for ice cream again. Are you coming...\r\nKofuki: I don't want any...\r\nChie: But you've been so into it lately? Every day you get one of those buckets tucked in your arms while you eat it all.\r\nKofuki: Leave me alone... I said I don't want any more ice cream!\r\nChie: Are you sure...?\r\nMihono: Ah, Chii-nee! Apparently, Fukki binges on eating something and then gets sick of it.\r\nKofuki: I never wanna see ice cream again...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5: Cut it out Already!\r\n\r\nMihono: Good teamwork, everyone! Ah, Mirja-san! Can you please do some maintenance on Kiyomitsu for me!\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono, I'll teach you the proper way to handle it yourself, so please try to remember. More importantly...\r\nMirja: When we pushed back the aradama without much effort, I was very surprised to see Shichinosato Kofuki obey orders and hang back without giving chase... She's changed, hasn't she?\r\nKiyoka: She has. It also feels like it's easier to talk to her lately. It's all thanks to Setouchi-san, I think.\r\n\r\n*Kofuki kicks a tree*\r\nKofuki: ...Damnit... I'm getting really pissed off! It's all Chichie's fault!\r\nKofuki: I just wanna do my thing and play with aradama-chan, but nooo!\r\nKofuki: I mean...\r\nChie: \"That's enough! Please...! You have to take better care of yourself!\"\r\nKofuki: ...Cause she keeps saying stuff like that...\r\nChie: \"You're hurt, Kofuki-chan! None of us are going to overlook that!\"\r\nKofuki: ...And that...\r\nChie: \"I'm so glad... You're safe, aren't you...\"\r\nKofuki: ...And that! She just won't leave me alone!\r\nKofuki: I-It's not like... Like I care if she's worried about me. I just don't like seeing her make that sad face is all...\r\nKofuki: Ahh, damnit! Shit! Chichie! It's all your fault things got so difficult!\r\nKofuki: Alright! I made up my mind! I'm just gonna do what I want to do from now on! And I'm gonna tell her off so she quits messing with me!\r\n\r\nKofuki: OI! CHICHIE!\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan?\r\n*Chie pats down Kofuki*\r\nKofuki: W-What're you... You don't have to feel me up!\r\nChie: ...Mm, thank goodness, you aren't injured. Your onee-san was just a little worried.\r\nChie: So, what is it? It's rare for you to come talk to me, Kofuki-chan.\r\nKofuki: Y-You see...\r\nChie: Yes?\r\nKofuki: Ah, I d-don't need... D-Don't worry about... Me... Anym-m-m... Ah... Uh, ah... (the text trails off and keeps getting smaller)\r\nKofuki: ...Anymore. Please.\r\nChie: ...Please?\r\nKofuki: Sh! Shut up! It's nothing!\r\nKiyoka: ...She's just shy, isn't she?\r\nMihono: She's having a meltdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Qn8sW115TSU\r\n[Railgun - Kofuki: Start]: It's Bizarre! The Human Aradama of Renpu Girls' Academy!\r\n\r\nRuiko: Shichinosato-san! Is it really true that Renpu Girls' Academy is researching human aradamas behind closed doors!?\r\nKofuki: The hell are you talking about?\r\nRuiko: It's a rumor I've been hearing from all the toji!\r\nRuiko: Since I like learning about urban legends, I thought you toji might have some, so I asked a bunch of people!\r\nKazari: I'm sorry about her, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: Then, why'd you decide to ask me about this? I don't really care about rumors and whatever, y'know?\r\nRuiko: Even if you aren't interested, you're still a toji at Renpu Girls' Academy, right? And also, I've heard you hang around the research labs a lot.\r\nKofuki: Well, you're not wrong, but still, human aradama...\r\nRuiko: It's exciting!\r\nKofuki: Like I'd know anything.\r\nRuiko: What, so it was only a rumor after all-?\r\nKazari: See, that's what I was telling you. There's no way that kind of thing would be real!\r\nRuiko: You say that, but, if it really was real, wouldn't you be interested, Uiharu?\r\nKazari: In that case... I think I would, a little...\r\nKofuki: Then, wanna go see the research labs? I was just about to head over there actually.\r\nRuiko: Can we!?\r\nKofuki: Sure, do whatever you want. Though, whatever happens when you get there, it's not my problem.\r\nRuiko: W-Whatever happens...? Then, are there really human aradama!?\r\nKazari: S-Saten-san, maybe we should just give up on this...\r\nRuiko: It sounds interesting! Let's go, Uiharu!\r\nKazari: Of course it came to this...\r\n\r\nRuiko: ...Gulp. This is the lab from the rumors... Shichinosato-san... Wait, huh? She's not here?\r\nKazari: She was right with us until a minute ago... Wh-Where'd she go?\r\nRuiko: ...Maybe the toilet?\r\nKazari: Do you think?\r\n???: Excuse me.\r\nRuiko/Kazari: HYAAAAAAAA!?\r\nRuiko: I'm sorry, it's not like we wandered in here on our own! Shichinosato-san just led us here is all!\r\nKazari: This is why I told you to stop, didn't I!\r\nTsugumi: Really now... This was mean of you, Shichinosato-san.\r\nRuiko/Kazari: Huh?\r\nKofuki: Ahahahahaha! Sorry, sorry.\r\nTsugumi: Honestly... My name is Ban Tsugumi. You wanted to look in on our research, didn't you? Make yourselves at home.\r\nRuiko: I-I thought you'd be mad at us...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Railgun - Kofuki: End]: Take it Easy With Gathering Rumors\r\n\r\nRuiko: When you suddenly popped out at us, I was thinking, \"We're gonna get turned into human aradama experiments!\"\r\nTsugumi: Human aradama... Ahh, it's about that rumor, isn't it.\r\nRuiko: You know about it!?\r\nKazari: Saten-san, let's stop asking them weird questions.\r\nSaten: But, we finally met someone who knows about it!? Aren't you curious, Uiharu?\r\nKazari: Well, I am a little bit curious...\r\nTsugumi: That rumor is completely made up. We don't carry out experiments fusing humans with aradama or the like here.\r\nRuiko: So that's all-.\r\nKazari: Then, what kind of research do you do here?\r\nTsugumi: We gather data on aradama and toji. To put it simply, we have toji fight with aradama, and we collect the resulting data.\r\nRuiko: Kind of like that?\r\nKofuki: ORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nTsugumi: Yes, just like that.\r\nRuiko: Is it alright for us to watch on for a while?\r\nTsugumi: It's perfectly fine. Just, hold on...\r\nKofuki: Alright, I'm done!\r\nRuiko: Hey, it looks like she just finished beating the aradama too, so let's go!\r\nTsugumi: Ah, please wait a moment!\r\nTsugumi: Uiharu-san, please stop Saten-san! The current turn hasn't finished yet!\r\nKazari: Ehh!? S-Saten-san, hang on!\r\n\r\nRuiko: Huh?\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nKofuki: Hey, what'd you come running in here for!!\r\nRuiko: I-I thought you were finished already!\r\nKazari: Are you okay, Saten-san!?\r\nKofuki: You two aren't supposed to be in here! Whatever! I'll take care of these guys fast, so just hide in the back!\r\nRuiko/Kazari: O-Okay!\r\n\r\nRuiko: Th-Thank god we're safe...\r\nKazari: This is all because you didn't listen to Ban-san finish talking.\r\nRuiko: ...Sorry about that.\r\nKofuki: Take it easy with chasing these weird rumors, will you.\r\nRuiko: Right, I'll be more careful about it from now on!\r\nTsugumi: ...I notice you didn't say you were going to stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/SIh8DzG3-h8\r\n[Aradama Hoodie - Kofuki: Start]: Pissing Me Off\r\n\r\nKofuki: GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\r\nMihono: !? Just now, that was...\r\nTsugumi: Yes, that was the shrill scream of Shichinosato-san just now.\r\nMihono: Knowing Fukki, an aradama probably didn't get the drop on her or something, right?\r\n\r\nTsugumi: Yes, it's difficult to imagine. I think it's safe to say something else must have occurred.\r\nMihono: Something that would make Fukki scream like that...?\r\nTsugumi: That's right. ...That aside, \"gyaaaaaaa\" is just the sort of scream you'd expect from Shichinosato-san, isn't it.\r\nMihono: Ahaha, you're not wrong. Anyway, let's go see what happened!\r\n\r\nMihono: Fukki!\r\nKofuki: You two're slow. Though, thanks to that, I got to take my sweet time having fun with the aradma-chan.\r\nTsugumi: This is exactly as predicted so far. So then, what was that scream earlier about?\r\nKofuki: What, you heard that?\r\nMihono: When you scream that loud, of course we'd hear it.\r\nKofuki: Whoops, sorry. I couldn't help myself from shouting. Aghh, just thinking about it pisses me off.\r\nMihono: Pisses you off? The aradama?\r\nKofuki: You dumbass, Mihocchi! There's no way an aradama-chan'd piss me off!\r\nKofuki: What pissed me off was that tree there!\r\nTsugumi: ...You love aradama, and you hate vegetation. You're very irritable.\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san, I'm slightly concerned for your future.\r\nKofuki: I don't get what you're getting at, but I can tell you're making fun of me.\r\nTsugumi: You seem to be lacking calcium. Would you like a candy?\r\nKofuki: I've got milk to drink! And like I'd eat that shady looking candy anyway!\r\nMihono: Ahaha! You two sure get along-. So, what happened anyway, Fukki?\r\nKofuki: This here!\r\nMihono: Your jacket?\r\nTsugumi: Oh? It's slightly torn.\r\nMihono: Ah, it is!\r\nKofuki: It got caught on that branch.\r\nTsugumi: I see, so that's why. Though, it's hardly a problem, is it? You have lots of similar jackets you can go back and get.\r\nKofuki: Doesn't matter; what pisses me off pisses me off!\r\nMihono: Then, how about next day we have off, we go clothes shopping together?\r\nKofuki: Clothes shopping? I haven't been in a while, so that sounds good.\r\nMihono: Nice! You should come too, Tsugumi-san! It's a date!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Aradama Hoodie - Kofuki: End]: On To the Shopping!\r\n\r\nMihono: And with that, we're here, Harajuku!\r\nKofuki: Yawwn... I'm tired.\r\nTsugumi: That's because you were asleep on the train. Here, have some of this and you'll be wide awake.\r\nKofuki: Oh-... Thanks...\r\nMihono: Ah.\r\nKofuki: BFWOO-!?\r\nKofuki: Oi, what'd you feed me!!\r\nTsugumi: Just something simple to eliminate drowsiness.\r\nKofuki: Don't pass me toxic crap like it's no big deal! You're freaky.\r\nTsugumi: Am I?\r\nMihono: Fukki's looking wide awake now at least, so let's go buy some clothes!\r\n\r\nMihono: By the way, how do you pick out your clothes, Fukki?\r\nMihono: I remember Kiyoka saying, \"Fukki's got a great sense of style!\", so I've been curious ever since.\r\nKofuki: I just pick out whatever. Cruise around the shops and buy stuff...\r\n\r\nKofuki: See, like that? Ohm.\r\nMihono: You say, \"like that\", but... Where'd you find these hoodies?\r\nKofuki: They were in the middle of the store, remember? [chew chew]\r\nMihono: I didn't see it... Nnn, this kind of thing's pretty cute too.\r\nKofuki: It looks good on you, Mihocchi. This's good.\r\nMihono: Thanks, Fukki.\r\nTsugumi: It's somewhat embarrassing the way we all match though, isn't it?\r\nKofuki: You think so? [chew chew] Mm-!\r\nMihono: ...That crepe must be yummy, huh.\r\nKofuki: ...[grin] Mihocchi, you want a bite?\r\nMihono: Can I?\r\nKofuki: Sure, but you get one bite, alright? Here... Open wide.\r\nMihono: Ahh-... Nngh!?\r\nMihono: Hey, Fukki! Weren't you gonna let me have some!?\r\nKofuki: Ahahahahaha! If you wanted to eat some, then go buy it yourself, Mihocchi.\r\nTsugumi: Ohm. ...[chew chew] I see, it is fairly good.\r\nKofuki: Hey, don't you go eating it!\r\nMihono: Now's my chance... Mmm-, so good!\r\nKofuki: Mihocchi too!? Ahh, damnit! Gimme back the bits you ate!\r\nMihono: How am I supposed to do that when I ate it!\r\nTsugumi: You could just go buy another one, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: Like you can talk when you're the one who went and ate it-!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/uHqT2Ku_lgU\r\n[Misogi - Kofuki: Start]:\r\n\r\nTsugumi: ...Let's put an end to things here for today. Good work, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: What, done already?\r\nTsugumi: Yes, this is plenty for today. ...Here, have some hot milk.\r\nKofuki: You didn't put anything weird in it, right?\r\nTsugumi: Of course not.\r\nKofuki: Thanks for that... Oww, hot! Let it cool down some first!\r\nTsugumi: Huh, had it not cooled off enough yet? I'm sorry.\r\nKofuki: Damnit... [blow- blow-]...\r\nKofuki: Oh yeah, get this! Earlier, Mihocchi went and ate my milk pudding, y'know!?\r\nTsugumi: That sounds like fun.\r\nKofuki: ...Huh? You even listening? What part about getting your pudding eaten sounds fun to you!\r\nTsugumi: Well... You've been sounding like you're enjoying yourself this whole time, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: I mean, it's not like I can be in a bad mood all day, right?\r\nTsugumi: You might be right.\r\nKofuki: ...Now it just sounds like you're trying to get off the subject.\r\nKofuki: Though, I guess it has been pretty fun and stuff lately.\r\nTsugumi: See, isn't that what I was telling you?\r\nKofuki: Don't give me that! Nobody's gonna come back with \"Yeah, it was fun,\" after they tell you about how they got their milk pudding stolen!\r\n\r\nKofuki: ...And that's what she said, but, what do you think?\r\nMirja: This isn't the sort of conversation we should have in the middle of a mission, is it.\r\nKofuki: It's not like we're finding any aradama-chan, so just loosen up.\r\nMihono: I thought I bought you another milk pudding though...\r\nKofuki: No duh? Like I was gonna let you off eating it like that. But still, what do you think, Mihocchi?\r\nMihono: What do you mean, what do I think...? She said you sounded like you were having fun, right?\r\nMihono: If you're having fun, then isn't that all good?\r\nKofuki: Yeah, I guess, but still, it kinda rubs me the wrong way somehow.\r\nMirja: I believe that's not the point Ban Tsugumi was trying to get across, but that you've changed, Shichinosato Kofuki.\r\nKofuki: Huh? I haven't changed a bit. It's not like, back then, I never had fun when I wasn't playing with aradama-chan or anything.\r\nMihono: I think you've changed a lot though? Like, when we first met, Kiyoka always stayed away from you, but it's not like that anymore, right?\r\nKofuki: I mean, you say that, but...\r\nKofuki: ...Have I really changed?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Misogi - Kofuki: End]:\r\n\r\nKofuki: I'm here-.\r\nTsugumi: Oh, you seem to be in a bad mood today.\r\nTsugumi: Did Asakura-san take your milk pudding again... No, you didn't get enough sleep, did you.\r\nKofuki: ...How'd you know that?\r\nTsugumi: You have bags under your eyes. It would be obvious to anyone.\r\nKofuki: ...Tch, you're too damn quick on the uptake.\r\nTsugumi: So, why weren't you getting enough sleep? Were you... No, you don't read books, do you?\r\nKofuki: Don't go deciding that on your own!\r\nKofuki: And anyway, it's all your fault!!\r\nTsugumi: Hm? It's... my fault?\r\nKofuki: Yeah it is. Cause you went and said I looked like I was having fun, it turned into this argument about whether I'd changed or not, and I felt too messed up to get any sleep.\r\nTsugumi: I'm having a hard time following, but... After I said you seemed to be enjoying yourself, you spoke to it with the investigation team, and they came to the conclusion that you've changed?\r\nTsugumi: ...Is that how it happened?\r\nKofuki: ...You got it.\r\nTsugumi: If you were that worried about something like that, then you really have changed, Shichinosato-san.\r\nKofuki: So what... You think I've changed too?\r\nTsugumi: I do.\r\nTsugumi: Of course you would change. Everyone is affected by the people around them.\r\nTsugumi: Even I've changed after becoming involved with the investigation team, wouldn't you agree?\r\nKofuki: I guess... Actually, did you change? Sorry, I don't really remember.\r\nTsugumi: ...Fufufu.\r\nTsugumi: It seems that the old Shichinosato-san really didn't think about anything besides aradama.\r\nKofuki: Well duh, wasn't that obvious?\r\nTsugumi: (On top of that, when everyone around you are people like me... It's only natural that it would change you.)\r\nTsugumi: Though, whether or not you change, you'll still be Shichinosato-san.\r\nTsugumi: I don't think you need to think so deeply about it.\r\nKofuki: You get real annoying when you're explaining stuff, y'know. Like, you're probably thinking you can spin me whatever bullshit, but I'm not letting you outta this one.\r\nTsugumi: I'm at a loss then...\r\nTsugumi: (I want to tell her that I think she's more lively before, and that she doesn't have to worry about unnecessary things, but... how would I get that across?)\r\nKofuki: Is that some aradama-chan!?\r\nTsugumi: Good timing.\r\nTsugumi: You do seem to be having the most fun whenever aradama appear. That part of you really doesn't change.\r\nKofuki: 'Course it wouldn't!

Even at your best, you're still like a noro magnet. Try keeping it together, Mihocchi! \r\nMihono: Hmph! I said I'm fine! Me and Kiyomitsu are ready to go!

Mmm, you're making your onee-san worried.\r\nMihono: Ahh... I get the feeling I've heard that before.\r\nMihono: ...That dream.\r\nChie: Dream?\r\nMihono: ...Yeah, a dream. I was fighting with a bunch of toji I've never met. You were there, and Yukari-sama was there... I think...\r\nMihono: Wait... Did that really happen?\r\nMihono: .......Wait, huhhh!? Is that really you, Chii-nee!? Eh? Eh? Why are you here? I mean, this is my room?\r\nChie: ...Starting from there, huh?\r\nChie: Yes, without a doubt, this is Minoseki's middle school dorms, home to Asakura Mihono.\r\nChie: As for me, well, I was traveling home. You know my dad lives around here, so... I stop by sometimes.\r\nChie: And, last night, I spoke to your grandfather at the Asakura Shrine. He said you were staying here now, so I got interested and wanted to see you.\r\nChie: It's been a while, hasn't it.\r\nChie: Maybe 5 years since I moved out to Osafune... But I see you still remember me. I'm glad.\r\nMihono: ...You haven't changed a bit, Chii-nee.\r\nMihono: And of course I remember you! How could I forget! There's no way I wouldn't remember Chii-nee!\r\nChie: Really? Then, I'll believe you. But...\r\nChie: I never thought you'd become a toji. Not to mention, you placed 3rd in Minoseki's qualifier tournament, didn't you? That's amazing!\r\nMihono: Yeahhh, welll. I lost hard in the semi-finals. Kanami's waaay too strong... This sucks... I'm just a substitute now...\r\nChie: (It sounds like losing was a pretty big shock to her?)\r\nMihono: I won't get my own hotel room... I won't get to go to the onsen... This sucks......\r\n*Mihono smacks her face*\r\nMihono: ...Alright, time to snap out of it!\r\nMihono: ...Oh yeah, Chii-nee! This is your first time at Minoseki, isn't it? If you want, I'll give you a tour! Until class starts, at least!\r\n\r\n4: Minoseki Academy Sightseeing Tour\r\n\r\nMihono: I said I'd give you a tour, but I bet it's not all that different from Osafune Girls' Academy.\r\nChie: Hmm, I'm not so sure. Don't you put a lot more emphasis on sword and scabbard craftsmanship courses here?\r\nChie: Passing down methods of okatana restoration is important, so all the schools in The Five Traditions have some form of swordsmithing course.\r\nChie: But when it comes to craftsmanship: in making scabbards, binding for the grip, metal fixtures and other mountings, sword knots...\r\nChie: I think this is the only school with a curriculum that fragmented? There's lots of students who aren't toji too; that's one of Minoseki's specialties.\r\nChie: I mean, at Osafune all the craftsmanship is consolidated into one course where they just teach the standard production methods.\r\nChie: That's why, for toji concerned with the details, they all turn to Minoseki's craftsmen for their scabbards, or grips, or guards they want made. You know, like Aoto-kan in Tokyo?\r\nMihono: Eh? U-Uh, yeah, I knew that...! Ahaha-!\r\nChie: Did you now?\r\nMihono: ......Sorry, I had no clue! Ah!, but basically, that means Osafune is high tech and Minoseki is old tech, right?\r\nChie: Generally speaking, it's fine to think of it like that. But when it comes down to it, their objectives with okatana are the same, though their approach differs through technology and tradition.\r\nMihono: I get it now~. Chii-nee, thanks for the lesson-! I prostrate myself before thee, hahaaah-!\r\n???: No way, miss Osafune. Tradition isn't all we've got going for us.\r\n???: It's true we put a lot of emphasis on it, but we're also keeping up with the latest research.\r\nMihono: Ah, Hattori-senpai, good morning! This is Chii-nee, my childhood friend onee-chan. And this is Hattori-senpai, a sword polisher. He works with computers and stuff.\r\nHattori: Thanks for the shaky introduction, Asakura. Nice to meet you, I'm Tatsuo Hattori.\r\nHattori: For example, we have here a training simulator for teams of toji that's been simplified enough for personal use. Want to check it out?\r\nChie: Ah, I'd like to see that. But is it really okay? I'm from another school and all.\r\nHattori: Of course; the technology's no secret. It's this way.\r\nHattori: Though, I called it a simulator, but it's not actually virtual reality or anything. We just reproduce battle conditions using computers.\r\nMihono: I don't believe it, Hattori-senpai's acting like a real gentleman! You're usually such a weirdo!\r\n\r\nHattori: Okay, Asakura. I set the arena to be Minoseki's dojo. For your opponent, let's go with a suitable group of toji. Should I set the enemy's level at its lowest?\r\nMihono: Bump it up higher, OK? I wanna show off my leadership skills!\r\nHattori: Oi, oi, you sure?\r\nChie: I think you should start from the lowest setting, Mihono-chan...\r\nMihono: Don't worry! Where there's a will, there's a way, you know!\r\n\r\nMihono: See? With a game like this, it's surprisingly easy to get a hang of!\r\nHattori: I don't think that was a fluke, but... Well, let's stop here.\r\nChie: That's right, it's best to quit while you're ahead.\r\nMihono: Hey, what are you two grinning about! That was pure skill, pure skill!\r\nHattori: Sure thing, Asakura. Anyway, Setouchi-san, there's one more thing our school is putting research into. The restoration of Akabane swords.\r\nMihono: Ahh! Akabane swords; those things that have been falling off of aradama, right? The, uh, rusted okatana.\r\nChie: You're not wrong, but... That's a shaky explanation.\r\nHattori: Well, being so happy-go-lucky is Asakura's charm point after all.\r\nHattori: That said, to us sword polishers, the importance of restoring these Akabane swords is comparable to toji putting themselves in danger fighting aradama.\r\nHattori: With our current level of technology, we still aren't allowed to forge tamahagane. At present, the only way for humanity to grow its arsenal of okatana is to acquire and restore these rusted Akabane swords from aradama.\r\nChie: That's right. And as of now, the only schools capable of carrying out recovery on a large scale are Ayanokouji and Minoseki... Ah, look at the time! Mihono-chan, aren't you late for class?\r\nMihono: Ah, you're right! First period is... Ancient Japanese History... Think I should skip?\r\nChie: Don't even think of it. I'll be waiting in your room, so study hard, okay?\r\n\r\n5: Off to Kamakura!\r\n\r\nYanase Family Butler: To think that our humble Mai ojou-sama would be representing Minoseki Academy...\r\nMai: Please stop, it's embarrassing...\r\nYanase Family Butler: Your father is proud of you from the bottom of his heart as well...\r\nFriend A: ...Well, I'm not really worried about Mai, but make sure you don't get off at the wrong station, Kanami.\r\nFriend B: Ah, I could totally see that happening.\r\nKanami: I-I'll be fine! I've got Mai-chan with me!\r\nFriend B: So quick to rely on Mai...\r\nFriend A: Well, Kanami is a bit of a swordfighting idiot savant, after all...\r\n\r\nKanami: Alright, I'm leaving here, Mihono-chan.\r\nMihono: Win.\r\nKanami: Eh?\r\nMihono: You better win the whole thing. You beat me after all. And also... Have fun out there.\r\nKanami: Yeah. It's going to be so fun!\r\nMihono: I'll be heading to Kamakura with everyone going to cheer you on. But just as your subsitute, alright? Ah, so if you leave me a chance, I'm gonna take it!\r\nKanami: Got it! I'll do my best! And when I get back, let's have another match! Fighting you in the semi-finals... It was really exciting!\r\nKanami: You were something else... You suddenly started coming at me in ways like no one school I've ever seen! Where'd you learn to fight like that...!\r\nKanami: If you hadn't started losing focus, I really would have been in trouble.\r\nMihono: ......Nn!? S-Stop, you're making me blush...! Okay, fine! We'll have a rematch; that's a promise!\r\nKanami: Yeah! I promise!\r\nMai: Kanami-chan, it's time to leave. The shinkansen is here.\r\nKanami: Okay!\r\n\r\nChie: And they're gone. Were those two Minoseki's representatives this year?\r\nMihono: That's right. Etou Kanami-chan and Yanase Mai-chan. Both of them are way stronger than me, seriously.\r\nMihono: I've got to get stronger too! And, like I thought, it seems like I've got to work on my concentration...\r\nChie: Mm, do your best. Now... I'm going to be leaving too. The westbound shinkansen just arrived.\r\nMihono: Eh!? Chii-nee, you're leaving already?\r\nChie: You have to prepare to go to Kamakura, don't you? Don't worry, we'll see each other again soon enough."}, {"paste_key": "ALfdEfye", "title": "1 - On the Other Side of the Tournament", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/ALfdEfye", "timestamp": "", "hits": "242", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4kDCMaPwbs\r\n\r\n1: What It Means to Carry an Okatana (1)\r\n\r\nThe next day... The day of the tournament.\r\nIn the streets of Kamakura, outside the tournament venue set on the Origami family estate...\r\n\r\nFriend B: Kamakura! This place is packed!\r\nMihono: Well, maybe if you're comparing it to our hometown. At least compare it to Nagoya or something...\r\nFriend B: Really? Well, there's a ton of people here!\r\nFriend A: You two... By the way, Mihono, do you have to go somewhere else in the venue? Since you're a substitute, they probably want you ready at any time.\r\nMihono: Nah, I can stay with you. In the case that Kanami or Yanase-san can't compete, I can be waiting in the audience.\r\nFriend B: I see... Oh! I spotted girls from another school! Could that be Kanami's opponent?\r\nKofuki: Hah? What do ya think you're lookin' at?\r\nFriend B: (...sneak sneak)\r\nFriend B: Mihono, I'm leaving this to you!\r\nMihono: (Eh!?)\r\nMihono: Ah, umm, sorry, about my friend. Those uniforms, you're from Renpu, aren't you? Since you're carrying okatana, does that make you their representatives?\r\nKofuki: Nope. This girl here's the representative. I'm just her escort...... Huh!?\r\n\r\n*sounds of crashing and running*\r\n[There's aradama!]\r\n[I'll call the police...]\r\n[Get out of here first, you idiot!]\r\nKofuki: Tch! What's going on here!? Kamakura's right in the Origami family's lap... Hell, their house is right over there! Those are some dumbass aradama!\r\nSayaka: ...You can badmouth them after. We have to stop them.\r\nKofuki: You don't have to tell me! So long as I get to kill some aradama, I'll be there!\r\nFriend B: Let's go, Mihono! We have to evacuate...\r\nMihono: You two get out of here! I'll help out those Renpu girls! It's a toji's duty to deal with aradama, after all!\r\nFriend A: T-Then we can help too!\r\nMihono: No way! Without your okatana, you can't use utsushi. You could really get hurt!\r\nMihono: I'm the only one with an okatana here, so I'll deal with it! Just... Leave this to me!\r\n\r\n2: What It Means to Carry an Okatana (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: They're small, but there's so many... We haven't even cleared half of them, where did they...\r\nKofuki: Haha! Not bad, Minoseki! What's your name?\r\nMihono: Eh? Name? I must not have said it before. I'm a 2nd year at Minoseki... Asakura Mihono!\r\nKofuki: My name's Shichinosato Kofuki, 3rd year in Renpu's middle school. Over there's Itomi Sayaka, same group, 1st year!\r\nSayaka: ...I'm going on ahead.\r\nMihono: O-Okay... She's gone!?\r\nKofuki: ...Yeah, well, she's speedy like that. And that just means we get all the aradama still here to ourselves! ...So first, let me make one thing clear.\r\nKofuki: If you take any of my aradama, my fun, any of the one's I'm claiming... You're gonna pay for it.\r\nMihono: Huh? What? Are you joking, or is this some kind of game to you...\r\nKofuki: What's it matter! Anyway, I'm on the hunt...! Kuku... I love you, aradama-chan!\r\n\r\n3: The Gale and the Storm (1)\r\n\r\nSayaka: ......This, isn't good.\r\nMihono: ...What's wrong? Umm, Itomi... Sayaka-san?\r\nSayaka: ............It isn't good, this pattern.\r\nMihono: What does that mean? Please... HYA!\r\nMihono: Explain...\r\nMihono: A little more! HYA!\r\nSayaka: ...When we beat one, the next comes.\r\nKofuki: Ahh, c'mon, Sayaka! You gotta use your words! Listen up, Minoseki toji. What Sayaka's trying to say is, we've seen this pattern before.\r\nKofuki: There's been a lot of these lately. You think it's a bunch of small fry, but then bigger ones start taking their place and suddenly you're surrounded.\r\nKofuki: ...Well, I can take on all the aradama-chan they can throw at me, so it's no big deal!\r\nMihono: Hey! Wait up, you two! What's up with them, no one's coordinating at all!?\r\nMihono: (Ngh! My focus is slipping too... What do I do... The situation's getting worse and worse... Ahhh, damnit! It's always like this! Is this all I can manage!?)\r\nMihono: Pant... Pant...\r\nMihono: (All I can do is try to force through their numbers...! ...! Ah, behind me!? I can't block in time!)\r\n???: That was dangerous, huh? We made it in the nick of time!\r\nMihono: (! ....Who!?)\r\nMihono: (That uniform's the same as Chii-nee... Toji from Osafune Girls' Academy?)\r\nEllen: Kohagura Ellen and Mashiko Kaoru are here to assist!\r\nEllen: We're in a big big hurry to the tournament, but this is more important now!\r\nKaoru: Quit the small talk. Nene and I'll take care of this. C'mon out, Nene.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\nEllen: Oh! You're so shy, Kaoru-chan!\r\n\r\n4: The Gale and the Storm (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: (These two, they're so strong...!)\r\nMihono: (Kohagura Ellen-san...)\r\nMihono: (She's using her toji skills to make the best of hand-to-hand techniques... I think that's Taisha-ryu.)\r\nMihono: (Looking at her, you wouldn't think she's so light-footed. And yet, the impact of her hits... The way she fights is so brutal, yet beautiful... I've never seen an infighter like this!)\r\nMihono: (And then... Mashiko Kaoru-san...)\r\nMihono: (She's so small that her okatana must be twice her height... And yet, she's slamming it around so easily... She's like a mini-tank...)\r\nMihono: (But...)\r\nMihono: (What's most amazing is the way they're in perfect sync with each other... Yeah... With these two here, I think we can win this!)\r\n\r\n5: A Toji's Duty (1)\r\n\r\nKofuki: Oi, Sayaka! With backup here, this is your chance! Hurry and get to the tournament!\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nKofuki: Go on already! If you don't show up for your match, the president's gonna be crazy pissed!\r\nSayaka: ......\r\nMihono: Ehh!? Is it really okay for her to go!? I mean, I know she's in the tournament, but...\r\nKofuki: Eh? Isn't it great? With Sayaka gone, that's even more aradama I get to kill!\r\nKofuki: And that means I really get to go wild!\r\nMihono: Eh!? Shichinosato-san!? She already ran off...\r\nKaoru: What's her deal. Is she alright in the head?\r\nEllen: Japan is a big place. There's all kinds of toji here.\r\nEllen: ...Anyway, let's leave the aradama to her for now. We need to help evacuate anyone still in the area.\r\nKaoru: 'kay.\r\nEllen: You too, Minoseki toji. I can tell you're exhausted from the way you're having trouble keeping your okatana up, but we could really use your help.\r\nMihono: Ah... Okay! I'll do what I can!\r\nNene: Ne-\r\nKaoru: You hide for now, Nene. You're an aradama too. That psycho'd probably come after you if she saw you.\r\n\r\n6: A Toji's Duty (2)\r\n\r\nRiot Policeman: The riot squad is here! There are 24 of us ready to help!\r\nEllen: We were waiting for you! Good work gathering so quick!\r\nEllen: We'll go ahead and leave this to you!\r\nKaoru: Riot cops...? Not even the special ritual squad? They expect these guys to deal with aradama? Can they really handle this?\r\nEllen: Oh, Kaoru! That's rude! Ah, officers, I'm sorry! She didn't mean anything by it!\r\nRiot Policeman: Don't worry about it. In fact...\r\nRiot Policeman: With their numbers reduced to this degree, we can surround the area and guide anyone out. From there, we'll hold our positions until the toji take care of them.\r\nRiot Policeman: And I'd like to thank you all for your speedy arrival in helping citizens escape and exterminating the aradama. In place of the people who live here, I am very grateful.\r\nKaoru: You should be.\r\nEllen: Quiet, Kaoru. Um, Mr. Policeman, you don't need to thank us!\r\nKaoru: We just did what we had to do.\r\nEllen: That's right, it's only natural. Anyway, if we can leave this to you, the two of us need to get to the tournament venue!\r\nKaoru: Yeah.\r\n\r\n7: Don't Think You're Getting Away! (1)\r\n\r\nRiot Policeman: Encirclement complete! Begin a search for anyone unable to escape! Keep them safe at all costs!\r\nMihono: They're so coordinated... Those riot police are real pros.\r\nKofuki: Tch, lame. I thought I had the place to myself, but they're getting in the way of my prey!\r\nMihono: Shichinosato-san...?\r\nRiot Policeman: Shichinosato Kofuki-san, Asakura Mihono-san, are you alright?\r\nMihono: Ah, yes!\r\nKofuki: What do you want? I'm in a real bad mood after getting my fun interrupted!\r\nRiot Policeman: You see... Even though we circled the area, it seems several aradama managed to slip through.\r\nKofuki: Huh? And you want someone to hunt them down? You want me to hunt them down? I get to hunt them down?\r\nRiot Policeman: Yes. I realize this may be a lot to ask of you, however...\r\nKofuki: Say what!?\r\nRiot Policeman: I-I'm very sorry-\r\nKofuki: No way! You shoulda said that sooner! So, c'mon, where'd they go? I'll tear 'em apart! C'mon! Tell me!\r\nMihono: Uh, I'll be going after her!\r\nRiot Policeman: Understood! I'm counting on you!\r\n\r\n8: Don't Think You're Getting Away! (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Phew... Seems like we took care of them all.\r\nKofuki: ...Heh, was that all they had?\r\nRiot Policeman: Thank you very much, you two! With your help, we were able to safely protect the citizens.\r\nRiot Policeman: I realize this was an urgent request, especially right before the tournament, and for that I'm very sorry.\r\nMihono: Ah! The tournament! It's going to start any minute now! Shichinosato-san, we've gotta get goi... She already left!?\r\nRiot Policeman: She left without saying a word just a moment ago...\r\nMihono: When was that-!?\r\n\r\n9: Onward! To the Tournament Venue!\r\n\r\nMihono: Pant, pant, I finally made it! The tournament, it seems like I made it in time...!?\r\nMihono: ...Now, what's the mood like in the assembly hall?\r\nMihono: Amazing, this stillness... This sense of anticipation! Ahh, man! I can't get enough of it! You can feel it; this is a fight to decide the greatest toji!\r\nMihono: That's right... Every year, the Origami family, who are responsible for unifying and organizing the toji, host this tournament. Which means it's a true test of skill for all who hold an okatana.\r\nMihono: Even these days, the name of the Origami family has carried a great deal of trustworthiness in their management of Okatana. The Origami are an old and influential family... (In Japanese history, official documents were sometimes folded with origami as proof of their authenticity. Mihono mentions the phrase for that as possibly originating from the Origami family name due to their history and honor.)\r\nMihono: Under the control and management of the Origami family, toji disciplines split into five training schools: The Five Traditions.\r\nMihono: Kanagawa's Renpu Girls' School, Gifu's Minoseki Academy, Nara's Heijou Institute... And then Kyoto's Ayanokouji Martial Arts School, along with Okayama's Osafune Girls' Academy. At this tournament, representatives from these five schools enter a fierce competition together.\r\nMihono: ...To put it bluntly, I wanted to enter too-!\r\nMihono: I mean, to be honest, my skills might be middle of the road, but... If the matches were on a short timer! Then I'd do better...\r\nMihono: In fact, if they were lightning rounds I feel like no one could beat me... If I could just focus a little longer, even Kanami would've... Even Kanami...... I oughta stop, yeah.\r\nMihono: (Anyway, my seat is...)\r\nFriend B: MIHONO-! HERE, OVER HERE-!\r\nMihono: Ah! I'm back, you two!\r\nFriend A: You idiots! Stop shouting! Mihono, they just finished saying the pledge and the first round is about to start! Look, it's Kanami versus Ayaonokouji's representative!\r\n\r\nFriend A: ...This is it, the final round. I wasn't sure if Kanami would make it this far...\r\nFriend B: Yeah, yeah! It's too bad about Mai, but her opponent was Kanami after all. If only they'd faced off in the finals instead of the semi-finals!\r\nMihono: It's a real shame~. But, you know...... Huh? In the stands over there... Is that? Chii-nee!? She said she was going back to Osafune yesterday...\r\nMihono: (Ahh-! That's why she said we'd meet again soon-!)\r\nChie: Fufu, I think Mihono-chan spotted me. I was hoping I could surprise her again afterwards, so that's too bad.\r\nChie: (That girl in the finals... Etou Kanami-san... At a glance she just barely won every one of her matches, but if Mihono says she's strong then I can believe it...)\r\nChie: (Her opponent in the finals is Heijou Institute's Juujou Hiyori-san... I don't think she can overwhelm her, but if she can adapt and outmaneuver her it should be her win.)\r\nChie: (Though, that okatana... Huh, that looks like Kogarasumaru... It can't be the real one, can it...?)\r\nMihono: Hmph. Chii-nee, if you were coming here you should've said something...\r\nFriend A: What's wrong, Mihono?\r\nMihono: Ah, it's nothing! More importantly! The match is about to begin!\r\n\r\n10: As the Curtain Rises, the Attack Begins\r\n\r\nThe tournament stadium was enveloped in an odd stillness. The tension before the match played a part, but there was another reason...\r\nGazing out from the front of the arena was distinguished seating for noble guests. From behind this seat, a door opened and the bamboo blind was raised. Accompanied by a toji, a lone woman stepped into the sunlight.\r\n\r\n--------Origami Yukari.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, there was a great disaster. At the time, at the age of only 17, Origami Yukari suppressed it and became known as a hero. Rising to the head of the Origami family, she replaced a great number of influential people. Her beauty, unchanged in twenty years, was plainly visible as she walked forward.\r\nFor the head of the Origami family to show herself... It became a cause for commotion; an unforgettable event expressed in a collective sigh of admiration.\r\nThough everyone was overwhelmed, the head of the family sat silent. It was as though, until the match was announced to begin, she would not move even an atom.\r\n\r\nReferee: We will now prepare for the match to begin... Bow!\r\n\r\nAt the referee's signal, the two turned and bowed to one another.\r\nKanami's gaze was firmly locked on Hiyori. There was a sharp glint in Hiyori's eyes, however... She wasn't looking at Kanami.\r\nUnder the eyes of all who had come to see, from toji to those who knew nothing of swords...\r\nAll spectators caught and held their breath for what was about to come.\r\n\r\nReferee: Both of you... Utsushi!\r\n\r\nThe two's bodies became enveloped in a glow that would protect them from harm. This was the battle armor of a toji:\r\nutsushi. A power belonging only to those who hold an okatana. Their ordinarily frail body protected by the netherworld; a temporary body takes its place. It allows them to escape death once, though after that the body vanishes.\r\n\r\nUtsushi prepared, the two stood ready to face one another.\r\n\r\nEtou Kanami, adapting to the moment, raised herself into the Mugyou no Kurai stance. Juujou Hiyori, lowering her center of balance, adopted the Sha no Kamae stance. Both were old stances, both equally unexpected.\r\n\r\nAnd, at that moment, the curtain was raised.\r\n\r\nReferee: Begin!\r\n\r\nIn an instant, the world was turned on its head-\r\n\r\nJuujou Hiyori vanished from the arena. In a split second, before even a thought could pass, it became clear what she had done.\r\n\r\nHiyori: (She deflected it!?)\r\nYukari: Third stage jin'i without preparation. Is this your \"single sword\"?\r\nHiyori: Absurd...!\r\nHiyori: (She was completely defenseless! And yet, where did Origami Yukari pull those two okatana from!?)\r\nYukari: Have you come to erase your mother's regrets? Fufu... But taking Origami Yukari's head won't be so easy.\r\nHiyori: Tch...!\r\nMaki: That's as far as you go, traitor! HAA!\r\nHiyori: (No! ...She's got me!)\r\nMaki: Minoseki's... Etou Kanami! How dare you interfere!\r\nHiyori: What, are!? No, why did you save me!?\r\nKanami: Just come with me!

That girl from Heijou, Juujou Hiyori, attacked Yukari-sama, and Kanami saved her.\r\nMihono: But I don't get it... But...\r\nFriend B: What? So what, Kanami and that black haired girl were working together!?\r\nMihono: There's no way! Kanami wouldn't... She had no reason to attack Yukari-sama! ...I'm going!\r\nFriend B: Wait, where!?\r\nChie: You're kidding me!? Mihono-chan!\r\nChie: (Don't tell me she's going after Etou-san? ...I can't let that happen! I have to get over there and stop her!)\r\nChie: I made it! Stop, Mihono-chan! You can't do this!\r\nMihono: Chii-nee!? But I have to talk to Kanami!\r\nChie: I'm trying to tell you...!\r\nBodyguard Toji: You two, stop right there!

I'll use jin'i to break through!)\r\nChie: Mihono-chan! I told you not to run! You're just making things more complicated!\r\nChie: (I don't have a choice... I'll follow her with jin'i!)\r\n\r\nMihono: Pant... Pant... Sorry, Chii-nee... But I can't let them stop me yet. I have to hear from Kanami... Why she did this!\r\nChie: Mihono-chan! It doesn't matter what you want; we won't get away with this that easily! Not those girls or us!\r\nBodyguard Toji: Oi! I told you to stop! If you keep resisting, I'll have to restrain you as traitors!\r\nMihono: They already caught up!? Guess I can't lose Origami security that easy... But still! Alright! Where there's a will... There's a way!\r\nChie: Aghh, I can't believe you! There's nothing I can do!\r\n\r\n2: Chasing After Kanami (2)\r\n\r\nBodyguard Toji: You... No matter how you look at it... This is treason, you know!\r\nMihono: Uh, I'm really sorry! I only used the blunt of the blade, so please forgive me! As soon as I hear why Kanami did that, I'll bring her right back, okay!\r\nMihono: So, I'm going!\r\n\r\n3: Because I Trust Her! (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: Pant... Pant... Which way did they go... Pant...\r\nChie: Pant... Pant... Mihono-chan... Why... Pant... Are you going this far... For that girl?\r\nMihono: Kanami's innocent... I know she is. After all, before we came here, she promised me...\r\n\r\nKanami: And when I get back, let's have another match! Fighting you in the semi-finals... It was really exciting!\r\nMihono: ......Nn!? S-Stop, you're making me blush...! Okay, fine! We'll have a rematch; that's a promise!\r\nKanami: Yeah! I promise!\r\n\r\nMihono: She promised me, we'd fight again.\r\nMihono: And, of all her friends at the tournament, I think I'm the only one with an okatana right now... So I'm the only one that can back her up here.\r\nChie: ...I see. Mm, I get it. Alright then, your onee-san will go with you.\r\nMihono: Chii-nee! Thank you!\r\nChie: You weren't going to listen to me anyway; you always used to be like this. Besides, \"where there's a will, there's a way\", right?\r\n*Chie draws her sword*\r\nChie: Now then, so we don't get stopped here, let's hurry and break through them, okay?\r\nBodyguard Toji: I caught up again! Now, don't resist...\r\nChie: Hate to break it to you, but we plan on resisting.\r\nMihono: (Eh!? Chii-nee...!?)\r\nChie: But isn't that fine? After all, the two of us are going after Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori to safely bring them back. We're not the ones you're after, isn't that right?\r\nBodyguard Toji: Uh... You're not wrong, but... Ah, hey, that's faulty logic! You're not gonna trick me like that! Everybody! Come on, get them-!\r\nChie: Ah, you saw through it~. Then you leave us other choice, right? Mihono-chan, I'll follow you right on through!\r\n\r\n4: Because I Trust Her! (2)\r\n\r\nBodyguard Toji: Ughh... I'm beat...\r\nMihono: Remember this, Mihono. When Chii-nee gets serious, she's scary...\r\nChie: Now, Mihono-chan! Let's hurry!\r\nMihono: I-I'm going!\r\n\r\n5: The Little Bird Breaks Through the Cage\r\n\r\nMihono: Kanami! I really found you...!\r\nKanami: M-Mihono-chan!? Why are you here...?\r\nMihono: Why... Everything's a mess back there! That's why... Why did you do that?\r\nMihono: Helping the girl who turned her okatana on Yukari-sama... That makes you a traitor too, you know! And who is that girl...!?\r\nMihono: (......That's not it! That's not what I meant to say...)\r\nChie: Etou-san, listen! Mihono-chan thinks you're innocent!\r\nChie: She just wants to hear the truth from you! No matter what happens, she's on your side!\r\nMihono: (Ah...! Thanks for setting it straight, Chii-nee!)\r\nKanami: ...Oh.\r\nMihono: Yeah! Please, just give me the reason! Yanase-san and everyone who came to cheer you on will want to help too!\r\nMihono: That's why, see? If there's anything we can do to help...\r\nKanami: ...! Hang on...\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan, did you... Have to fight anyone on your way here?\r\nMihono: ......\r\nKanami: ...You did. It felt like there weren't many coming after us... So you were distracting them.\r\nKanami: I'm so sorry. I got you caught up in this.\r\nHiyori: Are we done here? I'm leaving.\r\nChie: Ah! Stop right there!\r\n*Kanami blocks Chie*\r\nChie: Etou Kanami-san! Why are you stopping me! That girl is getting away!\r\nKanami: I'm sorry, but, I can't let you stop her! That girl must have a reason for this! There's a good reason for all of this, I know it!\r\nKanami: After all, I saw it...\r\nMihono: Saw it? What?\r\nKanami: Back then... Behind Yukari-sama...\r\nKanami: ...No, forget it. Just know that, right now... I won't let you stop her!\r\n\r\n6: Understanding Through Joining Blades (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: Kanami! I'm begging you, put your okatana away!\r\nKanami: Please, Mihono-chan! Just let the girl with Kogarasumaru, let Juujou-san escape!\r\nMihono: ...Fine. I'll let her leave, okay. But then, please, you have to come back with me!\r\nKanami: I can't do that!\r\nMihono: You can't... Then what!? What about the rematch you promised!? Is this what you meant!? Because I can't stand this!\r\nKanami: I know! We can have our rematch again later. I promise!\r\nMihono: But, Kanami, if you leave now...!\r\nChie: !?\r\nChie: Mihono-chan! Etou-san! Juujou-san! ...Behind us!\r\n*aradama appears*\r\nMihono: Eh!?\r\nKanami: Aradama!? How!? We're right in the middle of Kamakura...\r\nMihono: (These small aradama... They're the same as the ones we fought before...!? Did we miss some!?)\r\nMihono: Chii-nee! Kanami! We have to stop them before they hurt anybody!\r\nKanami: ...Okay! I'll help!\r\n\r\n7: Understanding Through Joining Blades (2)\r\n\r\nChie: This is as much as we can contain the noro, so it'll have to wait until the recovery team arrives. We've done all we can here.\r\nChie: Good work, everyone.\r\nMihono: I'm glad no one got hurt. Thanks, Kanami and Juujou-san. You really helped out.\r\nMihono: Huh? Kanami?\r\nChie: They already left. Kanami bowed on her way, as if to say she's sorry.\r\nMihono: Oh... While I was... Busy with the noro, they must have left.\r\nMihono: (Kanami... Why didn't you say anything...)\r\nChie: But that's a relief, isn't it, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Eh? Relief? What is...?\r\nChie: Now you know Etou-san isn't a bad person. She helped stop the aradama, and she wanted to keep your promise.\r\nChie: You can believe in her now, at least, can't you?\r\nMihono: Chii-nee... Yeah... Yeah, you're right.\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Because I Trusted Her! (1)\r\n\r\nChie: So let's go back, Mihono-chan. You got to know some of how Etou-san was feeling. We'll just have to leave the rest to the Yukari family.\r\nMihono: Okay... You're right. This is all we can do here... All we can do. Sigh, I'm really feeling powerless here...\r\nChie: Don't worry about it. The two of us can wait until Etou-san finds out Juujou-san's motive and makes it back home.\r\nMihono: Okay, I can do that. Thanks, Chii-nee.\r\nChie: Fufu. Ah, that reminds me.\r\nChie: You still have that old bad habit of yours, huh? When you lost concentration, you started spacing out.\r\nChie: You always got scolded for it back in the dojo, remember?\r\nMihono: Ugh... I-I'm always fine at the start. I always know what kind of techniques to use, and if there's something I haven't seen before, it's always like, FLASH! and I figure it out.\r\nMihono: But there's always a point where it runs out. I was doing fine against Kanami in the semi-finals until then. Why me...?\r\n???: Oi, you two!\r\nMaki: We're after the two traitors who turned their blades on Yukari-sama! Do you know which way they went?\r\nSuzuka: ...Wait a moment, Maki-san. I believe these two are the ones who attacked my subordinates and fled.\r\nSuzuka: Ordinarily, this is where we would take you in for questioning, but... That won't be enough to settle what you've done.\r\nMaki: Ahh, in that case, why not teach them a lesson first? We can drag them back after we're done.\r\nMaki: Try putting up the best resistance you can, you two. We'll have plenty of time to talk later.\r\n\r\n\r\n9: Because I Trusted Her! (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: D-Did we beat them...?\r\nSuzuka: You can't figure that out? You've lost.\r\nMihono: Kgh! \r\n*Mihono is cut and falls*\r\nChie: Mihono-chan!\r\nChie: Agh!\r\n*same happens to Chie*\r\nMaki: ...This is the end, you two.\r\nMaki: Now then... Osafune's Setouchi Chie. You're quite skilled, really. That was a good fight... However, you.\r\nMihono: Ugh... Gh...\r\nMaki: You're worthless. A total weakling. At first you showed promise, and I had the feeling you had been hiding some real strength. I let myself get excited, but...\r\nMaki: Utterly worthless, in the end.\r\nMaki: Before I knew it you fell apart, and that skill you first showed grew slow and weak. Like that broken okatana of yours, you come up entirely too short.\r\nMaki: That's enough, I suppose. By anyone's measure, this is the end. Oi, guards, go ahead and take them away.\r\nMaki's Underling: Understood!\r\n\r\n10: Osafune's Thoughts/Ayanokouji's Thoughts\r\n\r\nThe same day...\r\nOrigami family office--\r\n\r\nYukari: I see... I was wondering why, on the day of the tournament, you would request a direct line of communication with me. So this is it.\r\nSana: Yes, Director. It's about the unresolved issue the \"Akabane swords\" have presented us for over a decade now...\r\nSana: I would like to request permission to set up an investigation office, and compose an investigation team for dealing with it.\r\nSana: In regards to the Akabane swords, our lack of information has forced us into a stalemate. For a long time, humanity has been stalled like this, and I believe now is a good time to take action.\r\nYukari: \"Humanity has been stalled\", hm? What interesting phrasing. I was under the impression that the Five Traditions agreed it was a natural phenomenon. Did you not agree with that?\r\nYukari: It's almost as if you're suggesting someone is intentionally acting against us, Osafune President.\r\nSana: I'm simply asking you to take into account that possibility.\r\nSana: The current belief is that these okatana sunk in the ocean attract noro and act as the core for a newborn aradama. The idea is sound, however...\r\nSana: Considering the lack of a reason as to why these okatana are rusting, nor the reason why the outbreak of these aradama has been so widespread, we have not yet been able to form a reasonable explanation tying together all elements of this phenomenon.\r\nSana: Certainly it's a scientific process that's allowed us to come to our current dealing with the situation, however, this is nothing more than a makeshift solution. We have no means of permanently ending the problem.\r\nYukari: I see. A permanent solution? Very well. Osafune president, you have my permission.\r\nYukari: I expect great results.\r\n*phone hangs up*\r\n\r\n30 minutes later...\r\nKyoto prefecture, Ayanokouji Martial Arts School, President's office--\r\n\r\nYuzuki: I see. So you want to assemble a mixed unit with students from all the Five Traditions. ...A reasonable proposal, but I think you're hiding your real intentions, President Maniwa.\r\nYuzuki: For example, a reason you can't pursue at any time besides right now.\r\nSana: You mean like the owners of Kogarasumaru and Chidori attacking the director? Don't be ridiculous, that's pure coincidence.\r\nYuzuki: Well, it doesn't matter. At any rate, my school will provide you with a toji.\r\nYuzuki: And, after this, I'll indirectly propose the idea to Renpu's president for you.\r\nYuzuki: If she believes she'll win the director's favor through it, she'll jump at the opportunity no questions asked.\r\nSana: That'd really help. If I were the one to propose it to her, I can already hear her saying \"Why does the likes of you think she gets to speak on Yukari-sama's behalf!?\"\r\nSana: She's a real handful.\r\nYuzuki: I don't think her reaction will be any different if I'm the one to say it... That said, you're right that she'd be worse if it came straight from you.\r\nYuzuki: So then, what about Minoseki and Heijou's presidents?\r\nYuzuki: After the aforementioned incident with their Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori, the two have gone in to Kamakura for questioning.\r\nSana: It's a good opportunity, so I'll be the one to ask them. I haven't heard from them in a while either, so it'd be a nice chance to catch up.\r\nSana: ...With that, I'll talk to you later.\r\nYuzuki: Right.\r\n*phone hangs up*\r\n\r\n15 minutes later...\r\n\r\nMirja: Ayanokouji Martial Arts School, high school 2nd year... Kitora Mirja, reporting in.\r\nYuzuki: Enter.\r\nMirja: Excuse me.\r\nYuzuki: I'm glad you're here, Mirja. The details are as I sent to you: an investigation into the Akabane swords. For this, I'll need you to depart to Kamakura at once.\r\nYuzuki: For the time being, you'll be removed from your position as a captain of the Special Ritual Riot Squad, and be working under the supervision of the five presidents. I trust you don't have a problem with that?\r\nMirja: No.\r\nYuzuki: And, one more thing. While on this investigation... There's something I want you to locate.\r\nYuzuki: You are to search for, locate, and return to me an okatana. Its inscription reads: \"Namu Yakushi Rurikou Nyorai Kagemitsu\".\r\nYuzuki: An okatana long lost, in the distant past..."}, {"paste_key": "CJQ6cL0F", "title": "3 - Investigation Team Formation Exam", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/CJQ6cL0F", "timestamp": "", "hits": "159", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gf_EgUkR-M\r\n\r\n1: The President, the Akabane Swords, and the Girl with No Presence\r\n\r\nMihono: President Ema...?\r\nChie: Ah... I'm sorry for not contacting you, President Hashima. While I was with her, Mihono-san... I'm very sorry.\r\nEma: Sigh... Asakura-san, Setouchi-san, to raise your swords against the elite guard... You two have really done it this time.\r\nEma: What Etou-san did was bad enough, but you what you two did can only be considered treason as well. Ordinarily, you'd be lucky just to have your okatana confiscated.\r\nMihono: I'm sorry... Uh... So we're really... Going to lose our okatana?\r\nEma: Ordinarily, that is.\r\nChie: Excuse me, but, has my... Has Osafune's president said anything?\r\nEma: Setouchi-san, I've spoken to Sana. She's asked me to take care of you. So please follow my instructions.\r\nChie: I understand.\r\nEma: Now then, the two of you will be undergoing a change in assignment. Both of you are to take part in an investigation team that is being assembled.\r\nChie: ...Understood!\r\nMihono: Ah, uh, understood! ...So what are we investigating?\r\nEma: The Akabane swords.\r\nMihono: The rusty okatana that sometimes pop out when you kill an aradama?\r\nChie: In the post-war period... The American military tried to move five to ten thousand okatana overseas. But, while transporting them, the ship sank while in the seas around Urakawa. All those okatana were ultimately lost... \r\nChie: At the time, they were completely unable to recover them. However, in recent years, they've been found coming out of the bodies of defeated aradama.\r\nChie: ...That about sums it up, right, President Hashima?\r\nMihono: Chii-nee, you're like a walking wikipedia!\r\nChie: Mihono-chan...? This is common knowledge?\r\nMihono: (Humming~)\r\nEma: It seems Asakura-san needs to study a little harder.\r\nEma: Setting that aside, in recent years, the number of aradama incidents in the center of the Kanto region have greatly increased. The reason behind this is thought to be what's known as the Akabane swords.\r\nEma: Now, in this case, the presidents of the Five Traditions have been given permission to supervise a special joint task force investigating the Akabane swords.\r\nEma: Normally I'd give you a choice here, but with your crimes the two of you really have no option but to participate.\r\nEma: There's no problem with that, is there?\r\nChie: Of course not!\r\nMihono: We'll do it! ...So, President Ema, who's that girl?\r\nChie: What... Girl?\r\nEma: Hm...? Ah... I'm so sorry, I completely forgot. Let's see, this is Heijou Institute's Musumi Kiyoka-san.\r\nEma: She's the toji that Heijou Institute's president Gojou Iroha is providing for the investigation team.\r\nKiyoka: Ah, um...... Pleased to, meet you.\r\nMihono: (U-Uh... She... She's got no presence at all, does she!?)\r\n\r\n2: Aptitude Test (1)\r\n\r\nOne of The Five Traditions under the Origami Family, Renpu Girl's School--\r\n\r\nMihono: (The Origami family estate is practically next door... I had no idea Renpu was this close to them... I guess why they call it the Origami family's right hand, huh.)\r\n\r\nYukina: Hmph...\u3000So these girls are the pawns Minoseki, Osafune, and Heijou have to offer?\r\nEma: Yukina? These girls are fully qualified toji. Don't you think it's a bit harsh calling them pawns?\r\nEma: While you might be fine just staying on the director... On Yukari-sama's good side, you know you're not making any friends with that attitude, right?\r\nYukina: Tsk... Well, it doesn't matter. Just do your best not to hold back my Kofuki. Kofuki!\r\nKofuki: Yo...! Oh! Well if it ain't Mihono and boobies!\r\nChie: Boo... I have a name, you know. I'm Setouchi Chie.\r\nKofuki: So I was right! Since you're Chichie, and all. (chichi means boobs if you can't pick up on that)\r\nChie: Wha...\r\nMihono: Ah! Shichinosato-san! Short time no see!\r\nKofuki: You don't have to call me Shichinosato-san. Kofuki's fine. Fukki's good too?\r\nMihono: Then, Kofuki-san, I guess.\r\nKofuki: That's no fun, but whatever works.\r\nKiyoka: Um, nice to meet you...\r\nKofuki: Doesn't matter who I'm grouped up with anyway. So long as I get to cut up some aradama...\r\nKiyoka: Um! I'm Musumi Kiyoka, from the Heijou Institute!\r\nKofuki: Whoa, when'd you get here?\r\nKiyoka: That's rude! I've been here from the start!\r\nMihono: (Ahaha...)\r\nYukina: ...So, Minoseki President. Since Ayanokouji's pawn is running late, we have a bit of spare time. Why not test these girls to see who's really worthy of this position?\r\nEma: A test? You don't get to decide that on your own... These girls are the ones Iroha-san and Sana carefully entrusted to us...\r\nYukina: Carefully? You can't be serious...!\r\nYukina: Operator! Prepare the equipment testing room for a mock battle practical exam. In ten minutes I want that room filled with small grade aradama!\r\nRenpu Student: Understood, President!\r\n\r\n3: Aptitude Test (2)\r\n\r\nYukina: See! Isn't my Kofuki overwhelmingly superior? In comparison, Osafune's Setouchi Chie is painfully average, and your Asakura Mihono seems to be buckling under the pressure.\r\nYukina: Heijou's Musumi Kiyoka is a complete dead weight; she isn't even fighting!\r\nYukina: Ahh~! Let me make the difference even clearer! Operator! Prepare medium grade aradama. Hurry and raise the pace!\r\nEma: Yukina! At this rate, even your Kofuki-san is going to get hurt. You can't keep this up...\r\nYukina: Shut up. My Kofuki is a tool for fighting aradama. That's how I raised her, and, while you might not understand, that's what makes her happy!\r\nYukina: Just watch!\r\n\r\n4: Aptitude Test (3)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: I-I don't want to do this anymore... I thought we were just meeting up; why do we have to fight-!?\r\nKiyoka: Were't we just going to investigate... Kyaa!\r\nChie: What are you thinking, President Takatsu!? This isn't a test, this is a real battle!\r\nYukina: Don't question me.\r\nYukina: As pawns in the service of Yukari-sama, isn't it only natural to test whether you can be useful pawns or just plain fodder?\r\nYukina: Get back in there and fight.\r\nChie: We won't...!\r\nMihono: Chii-nee, we can handle this. This is our chance, I think. If we get to the bottom of the Akabane swords, there'll be less aradama, won't there?\r\nMihono: That means that, with our okatana, that we have to be skilled enough to protect everyone, doesn't it? So...\r\nMihono: Where there's a will, there's a way, right!\r\nChie: ...Nn, you're right, Mihono-chan. Okay, let's get through this.\r\nChie: Kiyoka-san. You just get behind me. You don't have to force yourself to fight, okay?\r\nKiyoka: A-Ah, but... I... Um... Ah... Okay...\r\nKofuki: Shuttup, this is my playground! If you're not gonna fight, then just get out of here! ...Actually, you two can get out too.\r\nKofuki: I only need me and my cute aradama-chan to have a good time! So bring it on! Fufu, I love you, aradama-chan!\r\n\r\n5: Aptitude Test (4)\r\n\r\nKofuki: What's wrong, prez! It's not over, right? Gimme more! I'll slaughter 'em all!\r\nYukina: Fufu, whatever you want, Kofuki. Operator, prepare the next wave of aradama...\r\nEma: That's far enough, Yukina! You too, operator. This ends here!\r\nYukina: Minoseki President...! Don't interfere!\r\nEma: I can't stand to watch any more. Yukina, do you think the director... Do you think Yukari would be happy if she saw this?\r\nYukina: ! How dare you...\r\nEma: Yukina...?\r\nYukina: What could you understand about Yukari-sama... About Onee-sama! I'm the one who knows her best... Who comprehends her! ...Hey! Operator!\r\nRenpu Student: ...Uh, yes!\r\nYukina: ...dama...to.........on the double, got it?\r\nRenpu Studen: But... There are still students... In the area...\r\nYukina: Just do it.\r\nEma: Yukina...\r\n\r\n6: Who's Interrupting Our Departure?\r\n\r\nKofuki: Seriously!? That's it!? Don't give me that! I know you've got more aradama! Bring on dessert!\r\nMihono: Huh... Did we do it? ...Oh yeah! Did we pass, President Ema!?\r\nEma: Seems like it. You made it through, though honestly your teamwork could use improvement. I can't say I'm too satisfied with all this.\r\n*alarms flash*\r\nAnnouncer: [Confirmed sighting of multiple aradama trespassing on the western end of the campus.]\r\nEma: The campus...? What does that mean? Why would aradama be... I don't believe it.\r\nEma: (...! You didn't, did you, Yukina!? Even for you, this is...)\r\nMihono: President! We'll take care of it! I'm pretty sure we can get there faster than anyone right now! Let's go, Musumi-san!\r\nKiyoka: Eh? I-I'm going too...?\r\nMihono: Of course! Come on! You too, Kofuki-san!\r\nChie: Shichinosato-san already ran off ahead!\r\nMihono: Ehh!? We have to hurry, Chii-nee! Bye, President Ema!\r\n\r\n7: Mirja Touchdown (1)\r\n\r\nChie: Shichinosato-san! Don't push too far ahead! Mihono-chan! You're losing focus; fall back for now! Just stay behind me, Kiyoka-chan!\r\nChie: (What should I do... I have to keep everyone safe, but I can't keep up with them all...!)\r\nMihono: Look out, Musumi-san!\r\nChie: (Oh no, Kiyoka-chan...!? I only took my eyes off her for a moment...!)\r\nAradama: GRRRRUUUU...!\r\nKiyoka: KYAA! S-Stay back! Don't come near me! Go away!\r\n*slash*\r\nAradama: GYUUUUUN!\r\n*dead aradama*\r\nKiyoka: Pant... Pant... I don't want... To do this anymore...\r\nChie: Thank goodness, she's safe...\r\nChie: (Kiyoka-chan managed to take care of that one... But, any more than this... I can't count on Kiyoka-chan to keep fighting in this condition!)\r\n*helicopter sounds*\r\nChie: A helicopter-!? Who's dropping in at a time like this...?\r\nMirja: What are you doing!? The enemy's numbers aren't so great! If you want to defeat them, just do as I say! This will be over in 5 minutes!\r\nChie: Who's that...!?\r\nMirja: Introductions can come later! Minoseki! Renpu is too far forward, stick close behind her right side and support her!\r\nMihono: Uh, okay...!\r\nMirja:  Osafune! Move forward and hold off the aradama on the left! Just hold them off; you don't have to kill them!\r\nChie: I-I'm on it!\r\nMirja: Heijou!\r\nKiyoka: Ah- Y-Y-Yes!?\r\nMirja: You hang back! Any aradama the other three let through are yours to finish off! Prioritize the ones already weakened!\r\nKiyoka: I-I'll try!\r\nChie: (Who is she? She seems so experienced... No, I can't think about that now. Getting through this is all that matters!)\r\n\r\n\r\n8: Mirja Touchdown (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Thank you, you saved us. I don't know how that fight would have turned out under my instructions...\r\nMirja: No, think nothing of it. I see, so you all are the other members of the investigation team?\r\nMirja: I'm very sorry for my late arrival. Allow me to introduce myself.\r\nMirja: My name is Kitora Mirja. As you can tell by my uniform, I'm a 2nd year in Ayanokouji Martial Arts School's high school division.\r\nMirja: Back in Kyoto, I served as a captain of the Special Ritual Riot Squad. For this mission, I have been ordered by my president to work together with you.\r\nMirja: Please take care of me.\r\nMihono: That's our line; you took care of us! In fact, you sound a lot softer now that you're not shouting orders. I was really surprised!\r\nMirja: Yes, in the middle of an operation, getting information out quickly and decisively is essential. If you had to ask me, I prefer acting more like this though.\r\nKiyoka: U-Um... The role you gave me, it wasn't so scary. So, thank you very much.\r\nKofuki: Yeah. After you showed up, I really got to go wild!\r\nMirja: Thank you very much. Now then... If it's alright with you all, would you please share with me your names and profiles?\r\nMihono: Sure, gladly!\r\n\r\n9: Let's go! ...To Where?\r\n\r\n-The next morning they set out together--\r\n\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie-san, just to confirm with you... The subject of our investigation is finding the source of the Akabane swords, suspected to be the cause of numerous aradama incidents. That's correct, isn't it?\r\nChie: Right. And so, why don't we head into Tokyo first? If only as a starting destination.\r\nKofuki: Huh? Shouldn't we get out of the Kamakura area? Like up where those Yanks were when their ship sank?\r\nChie: You're not wrong, but... From what the Five Traditions already looked into, they weren't able to find a single okatana near Urakawa where the ship was supposed to have sank.\r\nKofuki: So that's why we're stuck with Tokyo?\r\nMihono: Tokyo...??? Why Tokyo?\r\nMirja: Where to begin... As I'm sure you're aware, Asakura Mihono-san, aradama are created when noro gathers together.\r\nMihono: Ah, yeah. I know that much.\r\nMirja: Generally, noro is incapable of binding with inorganic matter. However, okatana have proven to be an exception... Or rather, even though noro cannot properly bind with an okatana, there have still been cases of noro drawing them in.\r\nMirja: Putting it simply, under ordinary circumstances, noro is not attracted to okatana. The only exceptions have been... As you might have guessed, the rusted okatana.\r\nChie: Also known as the Akabane swords. You know how we've been retrieving okatana that were encased in aradama.\r\nMirja: However... Don't you find this whole situation strange? Ordinarily, an okatana should be incapable of rusting or being broken. So why are they rusted, and why are they found inside of aradama?\r\nMirja: In the first place... Are they being rusted because the noro took them in, or did the noro take them in because they were already rusted? There have been attempts at researching the matter, but there are too many unnatural elements.\r\nMihono: Hmmm... But with my okatana... With Kashuu Kiyomitsu, the tip is broken off...?\r\nMirja: That's... Extremely interesting... No, leaving that aside for now...\r\nMirja: From that reasoning, there's a belief amongst the Five Traditions that the Akabane swords may have been subject to some form of unnatural processing, and intentionally scattered by someone.\r\nChie: ...Anyway, due to our lack of information, our best lead at this point is to head to Tokyo. That's where the most sightings of Akabane swords within aradama have happened.\r\nMihono: I get it... So, where in Tokyo are we going?\r\nKofuki: Huh? Wherever there's aradama-chan to kill, of course.\r\nMirja: While it's nice to be enthusiastic, that isn't our goal. First, we should stop by the local branch office. From there, we can ask for records from across the past few years...\r\nKofuki: That sounds lame as hell-!\r\nChie: We don't have a choice though. There's no other leads...\r\nKiyoka: ......Harajuku.\r\nKofuki: Huh!?\r\nKiyoka: W-We should go... To Harajuku, I think.\r\nMihono: Mm, Harajuku. That place is cool... Wait, huh!?\r\nKofuki: Are you an idiot!?\r\nMirja: Coming from the same Kansai region as you, I can't help but want to visit as well but... We can't be sightseeing on the job, Musumi Kiyoka-san.\r\nChie: She's right, Kiyoka-chan. Besides, Shibuya is better for more adult fashion!\r\nKofuki: You too!!"}, {"paste_key": "6LKBiy4E", "title": "4 - Harajuku Day Trip!", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/6LKBiy4E", "timestamp": "", "hits": "224", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ3A-S-B_s8\r\n\r\n1: Why Not Take This Chance to Enjoy Ourselves?\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Wow! So this is Harajuku! Everyone's so fashionable! Look at all the shops! And it smells so nice here, Mirja-senpai!\r\nMirja: Yes, Harajuku is truly a nice place.\r\nMihono: What's, uh, going on? Why did we actually go to Harajuku?\r\nChie: Even your onee-san is at a complete loss for words.\r\nKofuki: The hell... There's no aradama anywhere round here!\r\n\r\nMirja: Let me make this clear, we're on a serious mission. If your intention in going to Harajuku is simply to sightsee, then... Hm? Harajuku...?\r\nMirja: ... ........ ............\r\nMirja: No, that's a good idea, Harajuku. If I recall, that's where the sword shop Aoto-kan is located.\r\nMirja: Our mission isn't exactly time sensitive either. As Musumi Kiyoka-san has suggested, Harajuku may be a good place to pick up information.\r\nEveryone: Ehh-!?\r\n\r\nMihono: Well, since we're already here, we might as well enjoy it, right?\r\nChie: I guess, but...\r\nMihono: Is there something you're worried about, Chii-nee?\r\nChie: Eh, No... It's nothing. You're right, those of us from the west side of Japan rarely get to visit Tokyo.\r\nChie: It'd be a waste not to have fun while we're here.\r\nMihono: We're from Chubu, not Kansai, Chii-nee. Ah! Ice cream, let's have ice cream! Just look at the line at that place! It must be really good!\r\nKofuki: ...Ahh, whatever. I'm just gonna walk around. Seeya!\r\n\r\n2: Another Encounter with the Two Birds\r\n\r\nMihono: Fufu~, ice cream, ice cream, we all scream for ice cream~! Chii-nee, what do you want? I'm having melon sherbet!\r\nChie: Even you get swept away the moment there's sweets involved, hm, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Ehh? It's not like I wanted to come here or anything. But come on, it's Harajuku! Every girl wants to come here at least once. Right?\r\nChie: You're not wrong. Well, I'll have cotton candy flavor.\r\nMihono: Cot on... Candee?\r\nChie: Watagashi flavor. (Japanese cotton candy)\r\nMihono: Oh! I got it! I'll be right back!\r\nKiyoka: Um, can I look at that western fashion shop? I love their brand! And that shop over there, they sell the cutest boots!\r\nChie: What do you think, Mirja-san?\r\nMirja: ...I see no reason not to. Then, I'll accompany Musumi Kiyoka-san.\r\nKiyoka: Really!? Let's go! You're so tall, Mirja-san; I bet you'd look good in anything. I'm so jealous.\r\nChie: Everyone's just ordinary girls in the end, hm. Maybe Kiyoka-san has that effect on everyone?\r\nChie: ......\r\nChie: I'd better catch up with Mihono-chan~.\r\n\r\nChie: I'm here, Mihono-chan. I thought I ought to line up with you at least... What's wrong?\r\nMihono: Chii-nee... Look. In the shop...\r\nChie: At what... Eh!? Isn't that Etou Kanami-san and Juujou Hiyori-san? What do you want to do? Should we talk to them?\r\nMihono: I want to, but I shouldn't. If we did, Mirja-san and the others might find out about them.\r\nChie: That'd be bad for them, wouldn't it. Then we should... Wait!? Mihono-chan! The spectrum finder is going off!\r\nMihono: It found aradama nearby!? Show it to me...! It's coming from... Over by... It looks like Yoyogi Park! Hurry! We have to get everyone together and go!\r\n\r\n3: Team-Up? (1)\r\n\r\nLocal Broadcast: [This is an emergency broadcast... Currently, aradama have been reported on Takeshita street. Do not approach the area until the riot squad arrives. Police officers, please follow the toji's instructions and help evacuate the area immediately.]\r\nMihono: They finally made a broadcast! Local toji should be coming to help soon!\r\nChie: It's still up to us to hold out until they get here, though!\r\nKofuki: Heh! Then I'm gonna have my fill before they show up and spoil the fun!\r\nMirja: Stop! Shichinosato Kofuki! Don't push forward! If you move the aradama in that direction, you'll be putting civilians in danger!\r\nMirja: Kh... It's no use...! In all the chaos, my voice can't reach Shichinosato Kofuki!\r\nMirja: (What should be done here...?)\r\nMirja: (I could have Asakura Mihono chase after her... However, I doubt she would be capable of bringing Shichinosato Kofuki back. As far as tactics go this is a terrible choice, but, if only for a minute...)\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie-san! I'm leaving this to you! Hold this position until I bring back Shichonosato Kofuki!\r\nChie: Eh!?\r\nKiyoka: Um! W-What... What should I be doing...\r\nKiyoka: ...Kyaa!\r\nChie: Kiyoka-chan!\r\nMihono: Protect Musumi-san, Chii-nee! I don't know how long I can keep it up for, but... I'll draw the aradama to me!\r\n\r\n4: Team-Up? (2)\r\n\r\nChie: Kiyoka-chan! Keep it together! That's where the aradama are coming from!\r\nKiyoka: Ah, I-I'm sorry! I just... Kyaa!\r\nMihono: Ahh! Don't run away, Musumi-san! That's dangerous...!\r\nMihono: (...I suspected it, but... Can Musumi-san really not fight?)\r\nMihono: (Even though she's a toji!?)\r\nChie: (I have my hands full just protecting Kiyoka-chan! Mihono-chan can't last much longer...)\r\nChie: (Just one more! If just one more person were here! Then we could at least hold out until Kitora-san returns!)\r\n???: Allow me to help!\r\nChie: !?\r\nMai: Osafune toji! I'll be under your command, so instruct me as you see fit!\r\nMihono: Huh? Yanase-san! Why are you here!?\r\nMai: Asakura-san!? I'm here to find Kanami-chan! But I can explain later!\r\nMihono: G-Got it!\r\n\r\n5: Newly Arrived Ally, Ma<i> (1)\r\n(there's a pun in the title with the second kanji of Mai's name, meaning clothing, isolated)\r\n\r\nMai: Ha!\r\nMai: Ya!\r\nMihono: (Fighting up close with her like this, I can tell. Yanase-san's swordsmanship... It's so beautiful...)\r\nMihono: (She's so focused, but her movements aren't rigid at all...)\r\nMihono: (You can see how dedicated she was to her training, but she isn't bound to the standards.)\r\nMihono: (With a firm grip, she pushes through with her own style.)\r\nMihono: (I didn't get to fight her in the qualifiers, but if I had... I think I would have lost. These are the skills that got her second place...)\r\nMai: Oh... Asakura-san! That one's headed your way!\r\nMihono: Nn! I got it!\r\nMai: Good work, Asakura-san. I can see why Kanami-chan praised you so much.\r\nMihono: Huh? Kanami did?\r\nMai: Yes, even the other day at the inn...\r\n\r\nKanami: That match against Mihono-chan was the best in the qualifiers. She kept pulling out technique after technique; I couldn't tell what would come next! There was no end to it; I wish I could see more...\r\n\r\nMai: ...Is what she said.\r\nMihono: Ahh... I'm blushing so hard I'm gonna melt...\r\nMai: And then, she also wondered why you gave up halfway through.\r\nMihono: And now I wanna crawl in a hole... But Yanase-san, you also-\r\nMai: Just call me Mai.\r\nMihono: Eh?\r\nMai: Just Mai is fine. And then, can I call you Mihono-chan?\r\nMai: The truth is, I was a little curious... No, I couldn't get it out of my head. After Kanami-chan couldn't stop talking about you, I wondered what you were like.\r\nMai: I think... I got a little jealous, is all.\r\n\r\n6: Newly Arrived Ally, Ma<i> (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Yanase-san... I mean, Mai-chan... Err, Mai. You said you came here to find Kanami, right?\r\nMai: Last night, I got a call from Kanami-chan. I had my family's butler trace her location.\r\nMihono: !! She's a rich girl! I had heard about it, but it's really hitting me now how rich you are!!\r\nMai: Ah... Well, you see, the tracing confirmed she's in this area. And...\r\nMai: This is good timing. You chased down Kanami-chan too, didn't you? I wanted to ask you about that.\r\nMihono: Yeah, I did. I managed to catch up with them after the tournament. Kanami, she told me...\r\n\r\nKanami: I'm sorry, but, I can't let you stop her! That girl must have a reason for this! There's a good reason for all of this, I know it!\r\nKanami: After all, I saw it... Back then... Behind Yukari-sama...\r\nKanami: ...No, forget it. Just know that, right now... I won't let you stop her!\r\n\r\nMai: I see. Kanami-chan said all that... I really have to go talk to her myself. As her best friend, I owe it to her!\r\n\r\n7: Investigation Team... Team-Up! (1)\r\n\r\nChie: Kitora-san, Shichinosato-san! Thank goodness, you made it back...!\r\nMirja: I'm sorry for making you hold this spot on your own. As of now, Kitora Mirja and Shichinosato Kofuki will be joining the battle.\r\nChie: Understood, I'm ready for your orders.\r\nMirja: I'll take charge then.\r\nKofuki: Tch... Oi! Why are we wasting time talking! I only came back cause you promised I'd get the biggest aradama here! Are we gonna get to it or what!?\r\nMai: Excuse me!\r\nMirja: You are...?\r\nMai: I'm Yanase Mai, from Minoseki. Please let me assist you.\r\nMirja: Of course, I'd never turn that down. Then, Yanase Mai-san, please take point.\r\nMirja: The riot squad should be arriving soon. However, with our combined efforts, we should be able to clear away these aradama who would desecrate Harajuku.\r\nMirja: Now then... Get in position! Investigation team... Team-up!\r\n\r\n8: Investigation Team... Team-Up! (2)\r\n\r\nChie: It seems like most of the aradama are taken care of. Thank goodness.\r\nKiyoka: The riot squad made it, and all the civilians seem to have been evacuated too.\r\nMihono: That's good to hear... Alright! Mai!\r\nMihono: Go after Kanami, Mai! We can handle the rest here.\r\nMai: Okay... I'm going!\r\nMihono: B&B Ice Cream!\r\nMai: ?\r\nMihono: Just before, I saw Kanami and that Heijou girl eating ice cream there!\r\nMai: ......!\r\nMai: ...Thank you, Mihono-chan. I'll definitely find her and talk to her!\r\n\r\n9: We're Here! Welcome to Aoto-kan!\r\n\r\nMirja: All aradama in the area have been confirmed destroyed.\r\nMirja: Collection of the noro is mostly complete too, so from here we can leave it to the riot squad and continue on to Aoto-kan.\r\n\r\n...30 minutes later.\r\n\r\nMihono: Aoto-kan... I've heard of it before, but I don't really remember... They make scabbards and handles and stuff, right?\r\nMirja: That's right. Though it isn't affiliated with the sword administration, Aoto-kan provides scabbards for many toji.\r\nMirja: Of course, it's not uncommon for a blade to be used with the mountings it's assigned with...\r\nMirja: But, for more particular toji, they offer a variety of customization options. From the scabbard and the handle, all the way to the hand guard and hilt collar, they take custom orders for every part besides the blade itself.\r\nMirja: It goes without saying that, to those toji, Aoto-kan is a place we greatly admire. Of course, I fall into that group as well.\r\nMirja: Every school now offers training courses for their own craftsmen. However, even toji from Minoseki, which places the greatest emphasis on such students...\r\nMirja: Commonly find themselves thinking they'll become regular customers here, I believe.\r\nMirja: Of course, you are from Minoseki yourself, Asakura Mihono-san. I'm sure this is mostly common knowledge to you.\r\nMihono: ......I had no idea. Please forgive me.\r\nKiyoka: I know what you mean! If a shirasaya* is casual wear, then coordinating all the mountings together is an important part of a girl's fashion arsenal!\r\n*(shirasaya consists of only a plain wooden scabbard and hilt, intended for storing the blade and not at all practical in combat)\r\nMihono: I'm not too sure about that comparison...? I mean, I get it, but... An okatana is your partner in protecting everyone, and...\r\nKiyoka: Sigh... You don't get it.\r\nMihono: Eh?\r\nKiyoka: Mihono-san, you don't get it! Picking out the right parts is as important as picking out clothes for a date! For girls like us, it's a vital part of our outfit!\r\nMihono: Eh... O-Okay. ...Wait, d-d-date!? Musumi-san, have you been on dates before!?\r\nMihono: S-So mature!\r\nKiyoka: I-I haven't.\r\nKiyoka: I just mean that, I've read about it... And daydreamed about it...\r\nMirja: Anyway, are we ready to enter? We can't stand out here talking all day; we should go in and introduce ourselves to the store owner. By the way, the owner, Aoto Youji-san is...\r\n???: Real handsome.\r\nMirja: ...!\r\nAoto Youji: Nice to meet you girls. You came by as customers, right? And to have my pick of 5 cute toji to boot.\r\nAoto Youji: Pretty rare to see each of you wearing a different uniform, but from where I'm standing it's like looking at a garden of flowers. Ain't that right, ladies?\r\nKiyoka: Cute...\r\nMihono: Ladies...\r\nChie: Oh my, angels from heaven, that's going too far...\r\nKofuki: Huh? He didn't say that one!\r\nMirja: I'm sorry we caused a commotion outside your store.\r\nAoto Youji: Don't worry your pretty little head over it. If you came for consultation, I'll help you with anything besides the blades of your swords. Consider it on the house!\r\nAoto Hina: Dangit, pa! Quit ogling the customers! It's embarrassing! \r\nAoto Youji: ...Ooh, now I've done it. This here's my daughter. Normally she's at Renpu, but she's paying me a visit after the tournament.\r\nAoto Hina: That's what I told Renpu, but I'm actually just helping out the shop. I mean, with all those toji in Kamakura for the tournament, lots of them are gonna end up stopping by.\r\nAoto Hina: Ah, I know! Do you all want to help work the place today and tomorrow? We'll give you bed and breakfast!\r\nAoto Hina: We'll inspect your okatana at a discount to boot!\r\nMirja: No, we're on a mission right now..."}, {"paste_key": "TAunWJ2z", "title": "5 - To Izu", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/TAunWJ2z", "timestamp": "", "hits": "221", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ5-nA_Gx1o\r\n\r\n1: The Okatana Called Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu\r\n\r\nMirja: ...Thank you very much, Aoto Youji-san. Not only for letting us stay the night tonight, but also inspecting our okatana free of charge.\r\nYouji: I said not to worry about it. It's the least I can do for helping me out at the busiest time of the year.\r\nYouji: Oh yeah, and you can just call me Youji-san. Though come to think of it, you use the full names of your friends too, don't you?\r\nMirja: It's not my role to get close to them.\r\nMirja: Role? Just doing your duty, huh. Well, all things in moderation I guess. But still, call me Youji-san. Or Youji's good.\r\nMirja: Yo...... I can't. I'll stick with Aoto Youji-san.\r\nYouji: Haha, whatever works.\r\nMirja: ...Leaving that aside, there's something I'd like to ask you. Have you heard rumors of an okatana called \"Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu\"?\r\nYouji: Mm... If I remember right... The inscription was, \"Namu Yakushi Rurikou Nyorai Bizen no Kuni Osafunejyuu Kagemitsu\"\r\nYouji: Back in the Sengoku period... Takeda Shingen offered that okatana to the Sengen Taisha at Mt. Fuji. The Edo period was tumultuous though, and it's said to have been unaccounted for ever since.\r\nMirja: For you to know that much already... I shouldn't be surprised.\r\nMirja: Then, have you ever heard of any replicas being forged?\r\n(there's an extra line in here explaining away any confusion since utsushi both means replica and it's a toji technique, but I'm not about to try naturally working that into English)\r\nYouji: Sorry, I know that a replica was made but that's all. Anyway, if the real thing does turn up I'd love to go pay my respects to it.\r\n\r\nYouji: ...And that's all she asked me. That girl's all business; a real piece of work.\r\nChie: I see... Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu. Thanks for sharing that with me, Youji-san. But why is Kitora-san interested in that specific okatana...\r\nYouji: I've got no clue either... Anyway! Why're you acting like a stranger? If you were coming, you shoulda said something, Chie-chan.\r\nYouji: I didn't even hear a word about it from little miss Sana or old man FineMan. You could have given me a little warning so I could tidy the place up, you know?\r\nChie: Sorry, but I didn't plan on coming here in the first place.\r\nYouji: Ow, right in the heart.\r\nChie: Kitora-san and Kiyoka-chan insisted we come here. I tried to stop them, but...\r\nChie: It really was a coincidence. If anything, it'd be best for us to avoid contact altogether. Otherwise, people might get suspicious of our connections.\r\nYouji: Connections, huh... You're right, but, get this. I just got a message from that little miss Sana. She said to give it to you.\r\n\r\nSana: Two of our agents are currently on standby in Izu. I get the feeling they might have a run in with the elite guard, so I'd like for you to head over there and support them as best you can.\r\nSana: You'll have to convince the rest of the investigation team, but if Youji tells them \"A bundle of Akabane swords were recovered from the shores of Izu\" then they should come with you.\r\nSana: We've got something prepared for the ones already over there, so don't worry.\r\n\r\nYouji: And that's all.\r\nChie: My president's always a real slave driver.\r\nYouji: You said it. Well, it's getting late. You and the others rest up here for now.\r\n\r\n2: Together With Nene (1)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: This is amazing. The windows are so big, and the scenery is so pretty! Taking a regular train to Izu was a good choice.\r\nMihono: The line was called \"something View\", after all. Now that I think about it, Izu and Ise are pretty similar, aren't they? Like, they both have trains that go by the seaside, and they both start with I, and they're both peninsulas.\r\nKiyoka: \"something View\"... But you're right. I wonder why that is?\r\nMihono: Do you know, Kofuki-san?\r\nKofuki: Huh? I don't care!\r\n\r\nMirja: Still, leads seem to be easier to find than I thought. Thankfully, Aoto-kan's owner could provide us with that information about Izu.\r\nMirja: Just what you'd expect from a direct partner of the Origami family and the Five Traditions. Business isn't all he's good at managing.\r\nChie: Y-Yeah, right. Aoto-kan sure is something, huh...\r\nChie: (I can't let them know this actually came from my school's president...)\r\n*train screeches to a halt*\r\nChie: What was that!?\r\nMirja: An emergency stop!? My spectrum finder... It's picking up aradama!?\r\nMirja: (This is too much to be a coincidence.\u3000The day before yesterday in Harajuku, and now this... Twice in such a short span of time... And, if what Asakura Mihono says is true, not long before that in Kamakura as well.)\r\nMirja: (Either way, for the same team to engage aradama two or three times in such a short period is nearly unbelievable... There must be a reason behind it...)\r\nChie: Kitora-san?\r\nMirja: ...That's right, I need to be giving orders now. Setouchi Chie-san, keep the passengers safe with Musumi Kiyoka! Shichinosato Kofuki, Asakura Mihono, the three of us will begin exterminating the aradama!\r\n\r\n....Meanwhile, in a different train car.\r\n\r\nEllen: Oh! What happened!!!? It can't be aradama, can it?\r\nKaoru: That's what it looks like.\r\nKaoru: Let's go, Nene. Time for us to shine.\r\nNene: Ne-!\r\n\r\n3: Together With Nene (2)\r\n\r\nMihono: Ellen-san, and Kaoru-san too! Thanks for the assist! You were a big help!\r\nEllen: Oh! Mihono-san from Minoseki! It's been a few days!\r\nKaoru: ...Who?\r\nEllen: Minoseki's Mihomiho-san? We fought with her the other day in Kamakura. Don't you remember?\r\nNene: Ne-?\r\nMihono: M-Mihomiho...?\r\nKaoru: Like I can remember every... Oi, Nene, get back here. Why're you bugging her?\r\nEllen: Kaoru! Don't yank him by the tail! I feel so bad for him.\r\nMihono: Eh? What was that, an aradama!?\r\nKaoru: Stupid Nene... That's why I said not to come out. This little guy's Nene. He's an aradama, but he's basically my family's guardian spirit.\r\n*muffled nene noises*\r\nMirja: The Mashiko family guardian spirit... I've heard of this before.\r\nMirja: (Aradama are said to attract aradama... So in this case, it's highly likely Nene was the one who drew them here. That may be all there is to it.)\r\nEllen: Nene is a holy beast! Though, saying that... It's probably best if we don't get back on the train now that he's out.\r\nEllen: Which means we're walking the rest of the way! Where we're headed is close enough to go on foot.\r\n\r\n4: Walking and Wondering (1)\r\n\r\nMirja: Following the road like this, our destination shouldn't take more than half a day to reach...\r\nMihono: But what a coincidence! I didn't think we'd both be headed the same way.\r\nEllen: Yes! Very very coincidental, huh!\r\nMihono: By the way, I've been meaning to ask but, from the way you talk, were you raised overseas or something?\r\nEllen: Hm! Why were you looking at my chest when you asked that? This is just my grandpa's influence! I love my grandpa very very much!\r\nMihono: Me too! I have an awesome grandpa!\r\nKiyoka: Pant... Pant... Everyone's, going so fast...\r\nKofuki: Seriously, you're tired already? Why'd you even tag along?\r\nChie: Shichonosato-san? You don't have to be so rude. Are you alright, Kiyoka-chan?\r\nKiyoka: Yes, it's just... The shoes I bought in Harajuku don't seem to fit right.\r\nChie: They're probably just not broken in yet. You should try putting on your old shoes.\r\nKiyoka: You're right; it's a good thing I didn't get rid of them at Aoto-kan. Thanks for your advice back then, Chie-san.\r\nChie: It's hard getting used to new shoes, isn't it? Here, I carried them for you.\r\nKiyoka: ...! I'll change right away!\r\nKofuki: ......What? What are you?\r\nChie: Me? I'm everyone's onee-san, I suppose.\r\nKofuki: ......Tch, the hell's that even mean.\r\n*aradama appears*\r\nMirja: ...Investigation team! Form up!\r\nEllen: More aradama!\r\nKaoru: That's the second time today. What's going on?\r\n\r\n5: Walking and Wondering (2)\r\n\r\nEllen: That's strange. That's twice now in just a few days. I'm starting to think there's a trend here.\r\nKaoru: I head from incident to incident a lot, but it's weird for them to be following me.\r\nMihono: Eh?\r\nKiyoka: I never heard anything about all this fighting... President Iroha only said we'd be researching the Akabane swords... I don't like this.\r\nKofuki: I can't get enough though! I never get to see this much aradama when I'm out!\r\nMihono: ...Huh? Really?\r\nMihono: (This sort of thing happens to me at least a few times a year... Is it really just me?)\r\nMihono: (I guess... I just run into aradama more than usual?)\r\n\r\n6: Walking and Wondering (3)\r\n\r\nChie: The moment you step off the roads in Izu, you end up in the mountains. The sun should be setting soon, so we should stop at the first inn we see.\r\nEllen: Shh, please stop. There's aradama nearby... And it's not just one or two.\r\nChie: We're surrounded? What's going on? It doesn't seem like they've noticed us though... Is this where all the aradama we've been seeing have been coming from?\r\nEllen: It's hard to tell yet. But at least we're lucky there's no one living nearby...\r\nKofuki: ...You idiots, you got it all wrong.\r\nEllen: What? What do you mean?\r\nKofuki: Nothing, just forget it.\r\nKofuki: *whispered* So the elite guard brought out their aradama-chan... Heh, I'll take it.\r\nChie: (Shichinosato-san... She said \"elite guard\" and \"aradama\", didn't she? So the elite guard are here...?)\r\nChie: (No... More importantly, Origami Yukari's elite guard are using the aradama...? Could it really be...)\r\n\r\n7: Walking and Wondering (4)\r\n\r\nYomi: Our targets are caught in the network... I need to let Shidou-san and Konohana-san know... Their coordinates are... Here... And here... I can't get a good reading... Why?\r\nYomi: Are there not enough aradama... Rather, are they being destroyed...? Then... I'll just have to replenish them...\r\n\r\nYomi drew her okatana and raised it along her left arm. With a swift motion, a wound opened and began to bleed. In dark clumps it sluggishly trickled down. \r\nCompletely expressionless, she stared down at the dark substance with a deep red glow in her eyes.\r\nNot long after, the endless black liquid began taking shape, in a form of an aradama mimicking an animal... They slipped into the trees, deep in the dark woods, in search of their prey.\r\n\r\nYomi: Go, my aradama... For her sake, find Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori... Hurry, and find them...!\r\n\r\n8: Another Encounter with the Elite Guards (1)\r\n\r\nChie: Listen to me, Ellen-san and Kaoru-san.\r\nEllen: Yes, what is it?\r\nChie: This may sound strange, but the elite guard seem to be in the area.\r\nChie: Am I wrong in thinking it'd be bad if they found you?\r\nKaoru: Oi. What do you know?\r\nChie: I'm here on Osafune's \"business\". President Maniwa Sana gave me instructions to head here and support you... I think that should be enough? \r\nEllen: I see, I understand. You're one of us then. We won't ask any more questions.\r\nEllen: We're here on Osafune \"business\" as well. Our instructions were to test some new recruits.\r\nEllen: Running into the elite guard at a time like this would be some real trouble. ...Do you think they're after them?\r\nChie: Yes... Without a doubt, they're after Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori. The aradama from before seem to be tools of the elite guard in hunting them down.\r\nChie: Anyway, we'll distract the elite guard. You two can go take care of your business.\r\nEllen: Thank you so much. We really owe you one.\r\nKaoru: ...That'd help.\r\n\r\nMihono: Chii-nee, did something happen with Ellen and Kaoru?\r\nChie: No, I don't think so. But they said they had to go on ahead. They seemed to be in a real hurry.\r\nMirja: I see. Then in that case, we should clear this area of aradama to try making their journey easier.\r\n???: Oh... There's five of you? That doesn't match my info...\r\nMihono: (Someone's voice...? It sounded like... The head of the family's elite guard, Shidou Maki-san... But why would the elite guard be here...?)\r\nMaki: Minoseki's Asakura... So it's not the target after all. Still, good work Yomi. You might not be who we're after, but you'll make a good warmup.\r\nChie: What are you... Saying?\r\nMaki: It's simple... While hot on the trail of Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori, we found you two. The two who interrupted us the other day and let those traitors escape.\r\nMaki: From my perspective, that's more than enough reason to brand you as accomplices of those traitors... Don't you agree, Setouchi Chie and Asakura Mihono?\r\nChie: ...!\r\nMihono: Wha- But we weren't...\r\nMaki: My okatana, Hoemaru, has already made up its mind...\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san? Those girls are...\r\nMaki: Don't annoy me, Suzuka. Stay out of this.\r\nSuzuka: Sigh... It's no use stopping you when you're like this. Well, go ahead. I won't hold you back.\r\nMaki: Good, then don't interrupt. On this mountain hunt, our orders aren't to capture, but kill. You came at a good time, so I'll play around with you first.\r\n\r\n9: Another Encounter with the Elite Guards (2)\r\n\r\nMirja: Please stop! There must be some kind of misunderstanding!\r\nMirja: We're here on president level orders; on a special mission officially assigned by the Five Traditions!\r\nMirja: Confirm it with the Origami family! No, confirm it with the president of Ayanokouji Martial Arts School! Please contact President Souraku Yuzuki!\r\nMihono: She's telling the truth! After what happened the other day, as our punishment, we were assigned to this team!\r\nMaki: ...Is that true?\r\nSuzuka: That's what I tried to tell you... What these girls are saying is true. Before we set out, we received word from President Takatsu to allow an investigation team to look into the Akabane swords in this area.\r\nSuzuka: Isn't that right, Shichinosato Kofuki-san?\r\nKofuki: And that's what we said...\r\nMaki: Fine then. I'm not satisfied yet, but this'll have to do. Now, the five of you are coming with us.\r\nMihono: ...To where?\r\nMaki: We're short on manpower in this mountain hunt. There's two rats cornered in the area, and we need your help bringing them in. So you're going to do that.\r\n\r\n10: The Sword Spoke\r\n\r\nSuzuka: Going over it again, Minoseki's Etou Kanami and Heijou's Juujou Hiyori seem to have fled into these mountains. It's our orders to find and capture those two.\r\nMaki: It's not \"seems\". Without a doubt, they are here. Isn't that right, Yomi?\r\nYomi: Mm...\r\nMaki: The operation begins at 1900 hours. Until then, don't go far from this tent.\r\nMaki: And, Kitora Mirja. You come with me. I'll go over the finer details of the operation with you.\r\nMirja: ...Understood!\r\n\r\nKiyoka: ... ...... I... I don't like these people.\r\nMihono: Why do we have to take orders from that jerk!?\r\nMihono: I get that she's talented, but why does she have to be so mean about it!? And she didn't even apologize for almost hurting us! And on top of that, she's a liar.\r\nChie: Right. When she attacked us, she said they had orders to kill. But Konohana said just now that their orders are to capture them...\r\nKiyoka: Um... Etou Kanami-san... She's one of your friends, isn't she, Mihono-san?\r\nMihono: Yeah. Or maybe not friends, but rivals? Or maybe I'm the only one who thinks that. When it comes to strength, she's way way better than me.\r\nChie: Etou-san did make it to the finals of the tournament the other day.\r\nMihono: And she's not just strong either.\r\nMihono: Everyone struggles to keep her in check. She's crazy good with a sword... It's like, her sword... Talks to you, if that makes sense.\r\nMihono: Like, \"What technique can you pull out next?\", or \"How deep does your skill go?\", or \"What new heights will you help me reach?\"\r\nMihono: And when you're fighting her, you feel like your own sword's speeding up.\r\nChie: Until you run out of steam, right, Mihono-chan?\r\nMihono: Ahaha... You're right... I need to work on that... A-Anyway, that's what makes Kanami so great!\r\nKiyoka: ......\r\nKiyoka: But, at this rate, Kanami-san is going to be... They're going to kill her, won't they.\r\nKiyoka: ...I just don't get it. Why do toji have to fight each other like this? Why do we have to hurt each other?\r\nKiyoka: Why is everyone, why do they treat it like it's normal... It's scary.\r\nMihono: Yeah, I agree! An okatana is a tool for taking care of aradama. Not something you should turn on another person like that...\r\nMihono: You can't call anything about this justice..."}, {"paste_key": "fXy8G0aB", "title": "6 - On the Night of the Mountain Hunt", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/fXy8G0aB", "timestamp": "", "hits": "210", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMTHQYzNwfM\r\n\r\n1: It's a Toji's Duty! (1)\r\n\r\nMirja: It's time for the operation to begin. According to the elite guard's orders, we are to search the southwest side of the mountain.\r\nMirja: Satsuki Yomi-san, of the elite guard, will be on lookout duty. If we receive a report from her, we are to go to the scene immediately.\r\nKofuki: Hehh, Satsuki's Yomi-senpai-sama's on lookout, huh... Kuku... I'm getting all worked up... I can't wait...\r\nKofuki: (Gimme lots of friends to play with, Yomi-senpai. Kuku... I love you, my aradama-chan...!)\r\nMirja: What's the matter? You seem unusually excited.\r\nKofuki: Huhh? This is gonna be better than anything you've ever seen! We get to slash and bash and smash our hearts out! The whole mountain's gonna be an all you can eat buffet!\r\nMihono: Kofuki-san...? Weren't you paying attention? We're looking for the two escaped toji, remember...?\r\nKofuki: Dumbass~. You guys don't have a clue yet!\r\n\r\n...30 minutes later, in the mountains of Izu.\r\n\r\nChie: Is my spectrum finder broken? Or... This can't be right...\r\nChie: What's going on? It's showing the entire mountain covered in aradama! ...There's a village just by here; this could be very dangerous...!\r\nKofuki: Who cares about them? We've got a real treasure hunt to ourselves up here! We get to cut 'em up to our heart's content!\r\nChie: Shichinosato-san... You... No matter how much you love hunting aradama, there are things you should and shouldn't say!!\r\nKofuki: .........Tch.\r\nMirja: ......\r\nChie: What do you think we should do, Kitora-san?\r\nMirja: It's important that we find Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori, however... Before that, we are toji.\r\nMirja: We take up our okatana to protect the people. We cannot turn a blind eye to the ones living around here.\r\nMirja: Any aradama we encounter must be wiped out to the last.\r\n\r\n2: It's a Toji's Duty! (2)\r\n\r\n--30 minutes later, at the base camp in the mountains of Izu.\r\n\r\nYomi: .........?\r\nSuzuka: Is something wrong, Yomi? Did your network pick up something?\r\nYomi: ...My aradama have disappeared. The ones in the... Southwest.\r\nMaki: That's where we assigned the investigation team...\r\nYomi: I can't confirm that for sure... But...\r\nMaki: They're killing Yomi's aradama now...!?\r\n\r\n3: Reunited with Kanami\r\n\r\nHiyori: What's happening? I've never heard of aradama swarming like this.\r\nKanami: I don't know. But, I have this feeling like they're being guided...\r\nHiyori: Like they're moving with a purpose... Could someone be manipulating them? Either way, individually they don't seem very strong. But with so many of them, this could be a real problem.\r\nKanami: I can't even count how many are out there.\r\n???: Who's over there!?\r\nMihono: ...Kanami!\r\nKanami: Mihono-chan!?\r\nHiyori: ...It's you, from the other day! So you followed us!\r\n*Hiyori draws her sword*\r\nChie: Mihono-chan, what's the matter?\r\nKiyoka: D-Did you find anything...?\r\nMihono: N-Nothing over here!\r\nMihono: Hide, you two!\r\nKanami: Got it...!\r\nHiyori: O-Okay...\r\n\r\nHiyori: I see. So basically, as punishment for chasing after us, you were assigned to investigate the Akabane swords?\r\nHiyori: ...That's why I said we shouldn't get involved.\r\nMihono: ... ........ ..........Hmm~~~~\r\nHiyori: What is it?\r\nMihono: Nah, it's just, something about you two seems different since last time we met. Did something happen, Kanami?\r\nKanami: Yep, a lot of stuff! Keep this a secret, but...\r\nKanami: Hiyori-chan's super cute, you know? When we were in Harajuku, she went on a whole rant about chocomint ice cream, and...\r\nHiyori: Stup...!? Stop!\r\nKanami: Well a bunch of stuff happened. That's why, I'm...\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono! The aradama are swarming! Over by where you are!\r\nMihono: !!!!!\r\n\r\n4: Forced Together, Right and Wrong Comes into Question (1)\r\n\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono, why were you with these two? I hope you have a good explanation for this.\r\nMihono: I just ran into them here... That's the truth.\r\nMirja: You understand, don't you? The mission we were given was to capture these two. For you to...\r\nMihono: I won't do it!\r\nKanami: ...!?\r\nMihono: The elite guard, they said they were going to kill them! Or they did, the first time... For us to hand Kanami and Hiyori over after that...\r\nMihono: I'm not going to do it! That isn't the kind of justice a toji upholds! This is wrong!\r\nMirja: Still...\r\nKiyoka: I... Agree with Mihono... Chan.\r\nChie: I agree with Mihono-chan as well.\r\nMihono: Musumi-san... Chii-nee... Thank you!\r\nMirja: I see... Shichinosato Kofuki. What's your opinion on this?\r\nKofuki: Huh? What do you think? If we hand these two over, they'll stop the fun here too.\r\nKofuki: As long as I get to keep killing aradama, I don't care what you guys do.\r\nMihono: Wait... What does that mean?\r\n*aradama arrives*\r\nKofuki: See, that's what I'm talking about! They just keep coming!\r\n\r\n5: Forced Together, Right and Wrong Comes into Question (2)\r\n\r\nHiyori: You, from Renpu. What did you mean before?\r\nKofuki: Tch... All the aradama round here, Satsuki Yomi's manipulating them. They're her aradama.\r\nHiyori: The elite guard are using aradama... I knew it... I thought this was strange.\r\nKanami: Eh? But what does that mean?\r\nKofuki: Listen! To! Me! All these aradama are hunting for you two; Satsuki Yomi's controlling them!\r\nKanami: ...!?\r\nChie: ......!\r\nMihono: Huh!? The elite guard's? Controlling them? How?\r\nKiyoka: Eh... What's going on... Here?\r\nMirja: Hang on a minute. Does that mean that, all this time, we've been...\r\nKofuki: So now you figure it out. Yep, all this time we've been smashing Satsuki Yomi's eyes and ears. Pretty funny, huh!\r\n\r\n6: To Let the Birds Fly Free (1)\r\n\r\nChie: So, Kitora-san. What are you going to do? Aside from you... We've all decided not to hand Etou-san and Juujou-san over.\r\nMirja: I...\r\nMirja: Heh...\r\nMirja: If I had to say what I think, then...\r\nMirja: We do not belong to those in the elite guard, nor do we have to pass their judgement. Before any of that, we are toji. We are people.\r\nMirja: And as people, if we are to judge anyone, I see no reason to hesitate here. That is my conclusion.\r\nMihono: ...Then!\r\nMirja: We encountered both Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori, however, interference from aradama allowed them to escape... I believe that story will work.\r\nKanami: Thank you so much!\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nKanami: Hiyori says thanks too. Right?\r\nHiyori: Gh...! Don't go putting words in my mouth...\r\nMirja: No, I don't need your thanks. Rather...\r\n???: Hm...? Are you sure that's a good idea?\r\n???: It's going to be hard to overlook this.\r\nMirja: Shidou Maki, Konohana Suzuka... The elite guard!?\r\nMaki: Well isn't this funny! What you're up to is treason, you know. So you won't mind if we pick up where I left off earlier, do you?\r\nMaki: I'm sure you're aware you won't be getting out of it this time.\r\nMirja: No, this is not treason. Our investigation team is an independently operating unit; we have no obligation to follow the orders of the elite guard.\r\nMaki: Haha! That works too! In that case, I'll use everything in my power to get rid of those who got in our way.\r\n\r\n7: To Let the Birds Fly Free (2)\r\n\r\nMirja: You two go on ahead.\r\nHiyori: ...I'm sorry.\r\nKanmi: Still, thank you again!\r\nMirja: No, please do not misunderstand. We do not support your actions. However, I would like to see you two judged fairly by the law rather than here like this.\r\nKanami: Okay.\r\nHiyori: ......\r\nMirja: Investigation team! Form up! Setouchi Chie-san, Asakura Mihono, Musumi Kiyoka, you three take Konohana Suzuka! I alone will hold off Shidou Maki as long as I can!\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki, eliminate the aradama surrounding the area! Understood? Don't let a single one through!\r\nChie/Mihono/Kiyoka: Understood!\r\nKofuki: On it!\r\nMirja: Now, I will be your opponent. Prepare yourself, Shidou Maki.\r\nMaki: What's that, Kitora Mirja? Looking for a revenge match after last year's tournament?\r\nMaki: Don't be ridiculous...\r\nMaki: How far do you think you can resist me? A weakling like you!?\r\nSuzuka: I'll happily be your opponent as well. No matter how far those two run, they can't escape Yomi's network.\r\n\r\n8: Even so, I... (1)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: I'm so... Useless...\r\nKiyoka: I've always hated to fight.\r\nKiyoka: My hobby is reading. I like novels. I love romance novels.\r\nKiyoka: And, even more than that, I love fencing... I loved it.\r\nKiyoka:\u3000At my uncle's fencing dojo, I practiced harder than anyone my age, and I never lost a single time. You're so good, they'd say. You're so strong, they'd praise me. I was so happy...\r\nKiyoka: I loved it.\r\nKiyoka: That's why, when my first okatana... Koryuu Kagemitsu, chose me to be a toji... All I could feel was happy.\r\nKiyoka: When I was admitted to the Heijou Institute, I was so happy training there too. That's why, in sparring practice, my grades were higher than anyone.\r\nKiyoka: But... I'm so weak... I'm useless.\r\nKiyoka: Real fighting scared me. Getting hurt scared me. To turn tooth, nail, and blade against each other... Scared me.\r\nKiyoka: Even with utsushi on, what hurts hurts. What's scary is scary. I don't want to get hurt over a mission. I don't want to die over a mission.\r\nKiyoka: ...That's why I couldn't fight... That's why I couldn't hurt anyone, and I couldn't let myself be hurt. That's why...\r\nKiyoka: I'm so... Useless. I was... Abandoned by Koryuu Kagemitsu. That's why, all of this, is my fault...\r\n\r\nMihono: Kiyoka! Get back!\r\nKiyoka: Eh...!?\r\nKiyoka: (Oh no... I got lost in thought...!)\r\n*Suzuka cuts Mihono*\r\nMihono: Gh... No good! That's too many hits... I can't keep utsushi up anymore...! I'm exhausted... I can't... Focus. Dammit!\r\nKiyoka: (Asakura-san... Can't keep up utsushi...!? Then... The next hit she takes... Asakura-san will die...)\r\nKiyoka: (Shichinosato-san ran away to fight aradama... Setouchi-san already lost her utsushi...)\r\nKiyoka: (All this, just to protect someone useless like me... They'll all die... No..)\r\nSuzuka: In the end, you're only commonplace toji... How pathetic, investigation team. So you won't disrupt us any further, I'll put an end to you here...\r\nKiyoka: (I won't...)\r\nKiyoka: ...let you.\r\nSuzuka: What was that? Ahh, you're the one from the Heijou Institute... You're still hanging around? You're so useless I'd forgotten about you, so I thought you'd run away...\r\nKiyoka: ...I can't, let them all... for someone like me... I won't, let you...\r\nKiyoka: I WON'T LET YOU!\r\n*Kiyoka attacks Suzuka*\r\n\r\n9: Even so, I... (2)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: P-Please... Please, stop... Pant... Pant...\r\nSuzuka: What's with this girl? I overlooked her, but... She's stronger than I thought.\r\nMaki: Even just fighting defensively... To think you can protect not just those two, but Kitora Mirja as well? Against us elite guards? You can't be serious.\r\nMaki: Honestly... I despise you.\r\nMaki: Ahh... I nearly forgot. Musumi Kiyoka, from the famous Kanzaki dojo. While possessing skills that would put your seniors to shame, you proved beyond useless in actual combat.\r\nMaki: Suzuka, leave this one to me. As her senpai, it's my duty to teach her a lesson. However, the price you pay for that lesson will end up as stains on Hoemaru.\r\nMaki: Now, Musumi Kiyoka... Let Hoemaru imprint it in you...!\r\n*mid-swing, Suzuka's phone rings*\r\nSuzuka: Yomi, at a time like this...? What is it? .........A message from headquarters... Yes... I understand.\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san, it seems we'll have to stop here. Along with Renpu's President Takatsu, Ayanokouji's President Souraku has now demanded that we do not take aggressive action against the investigation team.\r\nMaki: What does that mean... Why would Ayanokouji Martial Arts School go out of it's way...? Kitora Mirja... What did you do!?\r\nMirja: I'm glad our phones get signal up in these mountains. That's what saved us.\r\nSuzuka: ...You're kidding. While we were fighting, you managed to call for help?\r\nMirja: Heh... A swordfight isn't always won with swords. That's all.\r\nMaki: ...You bitch!\r\nSuzuka: Maki-san, we were ordered to stand down. And also...\r\nMaki: What now?\r\nSuzuka: Yomi says she needs to replenish her supply of tracking aradama. The two of us have been ordered to return to base and recover as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n10: Each Finds Their Own Peace\r\n\r\n--The next morning.\r\n\r\n*phone rings*\r\nMirja: Thank you for your assistance last night. Without your intervention, the elite guard surely would have wiped us out.\r\nMirja: As for the investigation progress... Since my last report, we have found no new information on the Akabane swords. Nothing has changed involving the other members of the investigation team either... No, there is one thing.\r\nMirja: I haven't found anything conclusive, but there is one girl I suspect of operating under direct orders from one of the presidents: Shichinosato Kofuki.\r\nMirja: She seems to be aware of the relation between the elite guard and aradama as well, and...... But...... Yes, I understand. I won't look into it any further.\r\nMirja: No... I haven't made any progress in regards to Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu either. Yes. As you instructed, I will recover it.\r\nMirja: And I apologize if I inconvenienced you by calling at an irregular time last night. Until the next designated time, I will refrain from contacting you.\r\n*call hangs up*\r\n\r\n*phone rings*\r\nChie: Job well done, President Maniwa.\r\nSana: And good work on supporting Ellen and Kaoru. I've received word that Etou Kanami and Juujou Hiyori have passed our test and been taken in safely.\r\nSana: As we speak, they're being transported to Mokusa's hideout.\r\nChie: I'm glad everything worked out okay. So then, President, what should our investigation team do next... No, what should I have the investigation team do?\r\nSana: We have a collaborator in the riot squad commanded by the elite guard. She'll provide you with some interesting information involving the Akabane swords.\r\nSana: I'd like to put you in touch with her directly now, but we never know who could be listening.\r\nChie: Understood, President. Then, I'll wait for her to make contact with me.\r\n*call hangs up*\r\n\r\nMihono: Sorry, Musumi-san! For everything!\r\nKiyoka: Uh... Eh... For what though?\r\nMihono: I'm really sorry! You saved me in that fight against the elite guard...\r\nMihono: Honestly... I thought you had no business being a toji! I wondered why you were here if you weren't going to fight... But, Kiyoka, you're so much stronger than me!\r\nMihono: You were amazing back there! You managed to hold back the elite guard by yourself!\r\nKiyoka: But... I'm really, still just useless. Even then, I was so scared... I could barely bring myself to fight.\r\nKiyoka: Ah... But, I'm glad... Asakura-san, you called me Kiyoka just now, didn't you?\r\nMihono: Eh? Ahhh!? Sorry! I got carried away!\r\nKiyoka: And when you were fighting back there, for a moment, you called me Kiyoka too...\r\nMihono: Ahhhhhhh! I'm so sorry! I got too familiar with you, didn't I!\r\nKiyoka: Fufu... You just keep apologizing. But I really am happy. It feels like, I got a little closer to you.\r\n*Kofuki comes out of the bushes*\r\nKofuki: ...Oh, hey, you guys aren't dead, huh! Wait, where's the captain and Chichie?\r\nMihono: Chichie... Uh, the two of them are reporting in, I think. But anyway, Kofuki-san, where'd you run off to? We were worried after you disappeared in the fighting!\r\nKofuki: Huh? I was out tearing up aradama-chan all across the mountain, duh. Ahh, man! That felt sooo good! I've gotta do it again sometime!"}, {"paste_key": "r3GpuDVi", "title": "7 - A Doll's Melancholy", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/r3GpuDVi", "timestamp": "", "hits": "161", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HOmDCPCwk\r\n\r\n1: Return (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: We're back! Kamakura! It's only been a few days, but it feels like we were gone forever!\r\nKiyoka: I know what you mean. That reminds me... I wonder what happened with my hotel room?\r\nKiyoka: My president summoned me really suddenly, so all my luggage was left in the room I was staying in during the tournament.\r\nChie: That's... I'm sure someone from Heijou collected them for you. At worst, the hotel staff might be holding onto it?\r\nKiyoka: Y-You're probably right... I hope they didn't... Find anything embarrassing...\r\nMihono: Oh yeah, so that rumor about Akabane swords in Izu, that turned out to be fake, didn't it?\r\nMihono: Hmm... I thought Aoto-kan's Youji-san was supposed to be better informed than that...\r\nChie: It was, but we shouldn't blame him too much. Rumors are just rumors, after all. And thanks to that rumor, you got to see Etou-san, didn't you?\r\nMihono: Yeah, that's true. Ahh, I hope they made it out of there alright.\r\nChie: I think they'll be fine... But the bigger concern for us is that we found out about the elite guards using noro.\r\nChie: Though Mirja-san said, \"They overlooked it, so we shouldn't get any further involved.\"\r\nChie: But we can't stay quiet about it forever.\r\nMihono: To tell the truth, I'm really confused by it. I mean, that's not something a toji should do. Injecting noro in their bodies, all for the sake of getting stronger...\r\nMihono: You can't do that... And still call it justice.\r\nKiyoka: I'm scared. I don't know what's going to happen. Are we really doing the right thing?\r\nKiyoka: It's hard to... Feel confident in that anymore...\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nMihono: Oh? Kofuki-san, where are you going?\r\nKofuki: ...Tch. Renpu's research building. I gotta show my face in the lab every now and then. Relax, I wasn't running off to snitch on you.\r\n\r\n2: Return (2)\r\n\r\nKofuki: ...So why'd you guys tag along, again?\r\nMihono: You know, I just got curious is all.\r\nKiyoka: And Asakura-san said I should follow you, so...\r\nMihono: The older girls said they had something to take care of too.\r\nKofuki: Okay, I didn't ask about them.\r\nTsugumi: Hm... Well, if they're friends of yours, Shichinosato-san. Um, Asakura-san and Musumi-san, was it? Research team 16 welcomes you.\r\nTsugumi: I'm the mock battle operator, Ban Tsugumi. Our team is in charge of disposing of experimental results. Though primarily, other teams come to us for practical tests of their research.\r\nMihono: Disposing of?\r\nKofuki: What she means is, we get rid of the aradama they experiment on. We're the team on garbage duty.\r\nKiyoka: Do you... Always do that?\r\nKofuki: Isn't it great? I get to mess up aradama-chan as much as I want. Hey, Tsugumi, I came all this way, so let me in there a while.\r\nTsugumi: Now now, don't be in such a rush. You said you had to check in, but the truth is you're just bored, aren't you?\r\nKofuki: Heh, you know me! So bring out the aradama already!\r\n\r\n3: Return (3)\r\n\r\nKofuki: What a pushover... What's the deal? I know you've got better than this!\r\nTsugumi: Now now, don't get so upset. You'll be disappointed to hear this, but we ran out of the kind of aradama you like.\r\nTsugumi: You were away for a while, and in the meantime someone dropped by and disposed of them...\r\nKofuki: Huh? Who'd go and... ...!?\r\n???: It's me-!\r\nKofuki: Tch... Of course it was.\r\nYume: Bleh, I didn't think you were going to block that... I spent all that time setting up a sneak attack too; how boring.\r\nYume: The aradama here are so weak that I needed a new way to kill some time...\r\nKofuki: I had a feeling it was you...  Who said you could come in here and mess with my things!?\r\nMihono: Eh? Eh? What just happened? Who's this girl?\r\nKofuki: Tsubakuro Yume. From the director's elite guard... The last of the elite four.\r\nMihono: Ehh!? This little girl...?\r\nKiyoka: She's in the elite guard!?\r\n\r\n4: I Wanna Play with You so Bad!\r\n\r\nYume: Hmm? Hmmm-? Hmmm~?\r\nKiyoka: W-What is it? Did I say something wrong...?\r\nKofuki: Yume, that attack of yours wasn't for me. It was for Kiyoka, wasn't it?\r\nKiyoka: Eh? Eh? W-Why me?\r\nYume: You figured it out? After all, this onee-san, she's Heijou's Musumi Kiyoka, right? I heard all about it, she's strong!\r\nYume: She's the one who fought off Maki onee-san and Suzuka onee-san all by herself, right!\r\nKofuki: Huh... So that's what you're after. Then you two have fun together.\r\nKiyoka: Ehhh!?\r\nMihono: Wait! Kofuki-san!? Stop, Yume-san! The elite guard were ordered not to attack us...\r\nMihono: And besides, we haven't told anyone about...\r\nYume: I don't care about any of that stuff. I just wanna fight this onee-san!\r\nMihono: Still, you can't just go picking fights! Even as a member of the elite guard, there's limits to what you...\r\nYume: Ah, okay. Hmm... Then, how about I play with all of you! I'm fine with that too!\r\n\r\n5: Who Even Matters to You? (1)\r\n\r\nYume: Hmm... You're not as good as Chidori onee-san, but... You're still strong.\r\nYume: Hehe, I've decided.\r\nKiyoka: Eh... On, on what?\r\nYume: I wanna play with you some more, Onee-san!\r\nYume: So! You weaklings can get lost.\r\nMihono: I'm not leaving!\r\nKofuki: ...Like hell.\r\nYume: I said you're in the way! If you won't leave, then I'll force you down!\r\nTsugumi: I'll put a stop to this! I have an idea!\r\nTsugumi: If I release the aradama...! There, the gates are opening.\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAA!\r\nTsugumi: Shichinosato-san! Now's your chance! Take your friends and get out of here!\r\nKofuki: Huhh!? What did you do that for! You dumbass! You coulda just gone and called for help!\r\nTsugumi: Oh... Oh yeah, you're right. I got a little carried away.\r\nMihono: Kofuki-san! With all the aradama around, we need to get Ban-san out of here! And we have to do something about this before anyone gets hurt!\r\nKofuki: Way ahead of you. There's no way I'm gonna retreat with all these playthings in front of me!\r\nKofuki: Kuku... Let the hunt begin! I love you! My aradama-chan!\r\nMihono: Wait, that's not what... Ahhhh, come on! Why'd it have to turn out like this!?\r\n\r\n6: Who Even Matters to You? (2)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Asakura-san! The aradama are mostly taken care of! There's only a few left!\r\nMihono: Thanks, Kiyoka! Ban-san, come with me! Hurry!\r\nTsugumi: Ah, okay! You too, Shichinosato-san!\r\nKofuki: Huhh!? I'm not done here yet!\r\nTsugumi: Just come on already!\r\nYume: ...... ...... *angry yume noises*\r\nYume: You're really making me mad... I was just starting to enjoy myself... Why!?\r\nAradama: SHAAAAAAAA!\r\nYume. You're in my way.\r\nAradama: GYAAAAAAAA!\r\nTsugumi: I don't believe it... That one was A+ grade, and yet, in an instant... The elite guard are this strong...?\r\nKofuki: Tch...\r\nYume: I don't think so! You aren't getting away from me! Just watch, I'll show you how strong I am!\r\n\r\n7: Who Even Matters to You? (3)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Pant... B-Ban-san, she managed to get away, didn't she?\r\nMihono: Pant... Pant... I think she's fine now. The one that Tsubakuro-san's after... Is Kiyoka, after all. She'll be coming our way for sure.\r\nKiyoka: But why though. I never did anything to her...\r\nKofuki: Maybe she just can't stand her own kind? You two're both prodigies, after all.\r\nKiyoka: B-But I haven't been called that in a long time...\r\nMihono: At least if things keep getting out of hand, President Takatsu will step in, right?\r\nMihono: I mean, at Izu, remember? She told the elite guard to leave us alone.\r\nKofuki: Not gonna happen.\r\nKofuki: And anyway, that Tsubakuro Yume never listens to whatever our President says.\r\nKofuki: But still, the president doesn't care about m... About us students...\r\nYume: Yep. That old hag only cares about Sayaka, after all.\r\nYume: To her, you guys are nothing more than, hm, interchangeable parts?\r\nMihono/Kiyoka/Kofuki: ......!\r\nMihono: You two can still use utsushi, right?\r\nKiyoka/Kofuki: Mm....!\r\nMihono: Tsubakuro-san is strong. And honestly, I don't know if even the three of us can win... But we can try!\r\nYume: Ahahahahaha! Yeah! That's how it should be!\r\n\r\n8: Who Even Matters to You? (4)\r\n\r\nYume: Onee-san, you're all so fun! Not enough for me to use \"that\", but maybe I can get a little serious!\r\n???: I'm afraid I can't let you continue.\r\nYume: Nn? ...Who're you?\r\nChie: Hmm, these girls' onee-chans, I suppose?\r\nMirja: That's how it is. (cute blushing Mirja)\r\nMihono: Chii-nee! Mirja-san!\r\nMirja: I see, so you intend to continue what was left off at Izu?\r\nMirja: My school's president gave the order to stop, and the elite guard agreed to no longer take aggressive action. But if you continue, we have no choice but to join in.\r\nYume: ...So now you're ganging up on me?\r\nMihono/Kofuki: ........\r\nYume: ....Fine.\r\nYume: I get it, I get it. You have to because you're weak.\r\nYume: ....Ahhh, this just got really boring. Beating weaklings won't... I'm bored... I'm going home.\r\nKiyoka/Mihono/Kofuki: .... ........ ............\r\nMihono: Y-You saved us~!\r\nKiyoka: I was worried about what would happen next...\r\nKofuki: ......\r\nChie: Thank you, Kofuki-chan. You protected Mihono-chan and Kiyoka-chan, didn't you?\r\nKofuki: HUH?\r\nKofuki: That's not what happened!\r\nChie: Really? In any case, you made your onee-chan happy. Everyone's safe, aren't they?\r\nKofuki: Tch......\r\nMirja: Safe, but they seem to have been severely beaten... We're very lucky they aren't injured.\r\nMirja: Anyway... We should leave here as soon as possible. Afterward, there's something we need to tell all of you.\r\n\r\n9: The Location of the Akabane Swords\r\n\r\nMirja: ...To find out who is scattering the Akabane swords, and for what purpose, we must head to Tokyo.\r\nMihono: Scattering? You said someone is scattering them... Right?\r\nMirja: Yes.\r\nMirja: Yesterday, Osafune contacted Setouchi Chie-san about an anonymous informant willing to expose the reasoning behind why the Akabane swords have been found in aradama.\r\nMirja: Our destination is the Kita ward of Tokyo, to the Akabane district itself. To meet with this informant, our investigation team has been assigned as official representatives of the Sword Administration.\r\nKiyoka: It finally feels like we're doing an investigation, doesn't it? We won't have to fight any aradama or elite guards this time.\r\nMihono: What a relief.\r\nKiyoka: Yes~.\r\nKiyoka: Though, why would they suddenly decide to expose... I mean, why would they feel like contacting us now?\r\nMirja: That's true. We were curious about that as well. From what Setouchi Chie-san was able to learn over the phone, it's very likely...\r\nMirja: To be in response to the creation of this investigation team.\r\nKiyoka: But, Mirja-san, that would also mean...\r\nMihono: ???\r\nMirja: Yes. We haven't exactly been operating with much secrecy, however, this response is still too quick.\r\nMirja: There may be a spy within the Sword Administration, or someone may be leaking information. Whatever the case, it's best to think all our actions are being leaked from now on.\r\nMirja: In fact... This informant may have contacted us with the intention of making us aware that they have access to our information.\r\nKiyoka: You think it's a threat?\r\nMihono: ......Well, maybe they're telling us to stay careful!\r\nChie: Maybe. I'd rather hope they mean well. That this has nothing to do with spies or research into using noro.\r\nKiyoka: Right!"}, {"paste_key": "avXMgg75", "title": "8 - To the Site of the Final Battle", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/avXMgg75", "timestamp": "", "hits": "215", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHm9KePEIHQ\r\n\r\n1: On the Road to the Birthplace of the Akabane Swords (1)\r\n\r\nMirja: I have to thank you, Setouchi Chie-san.\r\nMirja: Without sharing us your lead from Osafune, we would likely still be searching the mountains of Izu in vain.\r\nChie: You don't have to be so formal, Mirja-san. We're friends, aren't we? At least among this group, I think we should be able to be more open with each other.\r\nChie: Though, saying that... I have my doubts about this. It's not like Osafune's intelligence department to be very wrong, but...\r\nMihono: But, Chii-nee...\u3000This place is pretty developed. It's right in front of the station, and there's a bunch of high rise apartments over there.\r\nMihono: Would the kind of person with such an important lead on the Akabane swords really be hanging around here?\r\nMihono: Ah! When we're done here, can we buy cake back at the station?\r\nChie: ...Mihono-chan, we're here on business? But you have a point... It's a little weird to think someone with such a dangerous connection would take us to such a peaceful place.\r\nMirja: No, I don't think it's out of place. Here, in the Kita ward of Tokyo... After the war, the occupying American military forces seized weapons from the population and collected them here.\r\nMirja: The Akabane swords were stored here until the American military was ready to remove them from the country, on the ship that sank after leaving from Yokohama. As the name suggests, this place: the Akabane district, is the birthplace of the Akabane swords.\r\nMirja: So in fact, it doesn't surprise me at all that this place is once again connected to their recent activity.\r\nChie: That's right... When you put that in perspective, it does feel as though the path we're walking has been expressly laid out for us.\r\nMirja: That may be truer than you think. Even this very walkway covers what was once railroad tracks used for transport to this storehouse.\r\nMihono: Oh, I see it! That's why the tiles are aligned like that, like railroad tracks!\r\nKiyoka: You're right! I didn't notice it at all.\r\nKofuki: Hmm. So anyway, this place we're going to, there's not gonna be any aradama there, is there?\r\nMihono: Well of course not. We're just here to talk to someone.\r\nThe Bushes: *rustle rustle*\r\nMihono: ...?\r\nSmall Aradama: GICHIGICHIGIGUGUGGGG...!\r\nKiyoka: Ehh!?\r\nMihono: Aradama!? How'd it even get here!?\r\nKofuki: You lied to me; they're totally here!\r\nMihono: Wait! Kofuki-san! Come back!\r\n\r\n2: On the Road to the Birthplace of the Akabane Swords (2)\r\n\r\nMirja: (Even here the aradama follow us... What is going on... No... With numbers like this, it could be...)\r\nMirja: Investigation team, listen! If the one we're meeting is in possession of an Akabane sword, the aradama may be gathering to attack them!\r\nMirja: Even if that's not the case, it's dangerous for us to linger! We need to push through and make contact with them as soon as possible! Then we'll protect them!\r\n\r\n3: Mirja ~The Ties that Bind~\r\n\r\nMirja: ...The enemy's numbers are far greater than I imagined. Furthermore, they're becoming more dense as we push forward.\r\nChie: You're right... I never would have expected this many... I don't know what to make of this.\r\nMirja: I feel like we may be drawing them in. However, we can't afford to waste any time. Our only option is to quickly make our way through.\r\nMirja: (Sharpen your senses, Kitora Mirja... Asakura Mihono's breathing, Musumi Kiyoka's limitations, Setouchi Chie's unease, Shichinosato Kofuki's unpredictability...)\r\nMirja: (When it comes to deciding the investigation team's formation, the first step is considering the actions of Shichinosato Kofuki. The moment she sees aradama, she charges ahead. With her acting as a wedge, the other three must flexibly adapt behind her. The only role I can give her is to push through.)\r\nMirja: (Setouchi Chie. As a toji, she offers a strong sense of stability. More than that, she is an indispensable mental brace for the others. Honestly, without her support, this team would collapse.)\r\nMirja: (As I saw in Izu, there is no doubt about Musumi Kiyoka's full potential. Due to her nature and the short reach of her okatana I don't want her in the front, however I can trust her to protect herself.)\r\nMirja: (The one I have the most trouble understanding would be... Asakura Mihono. When it comes to her movements or her techniques, everything is unstable. In a moment any competence she displays can vanish. And, inversely, there are moments her actions take on a masterful level of expertise.)\r\nMirja: (She is impossible to gauge. At the very least, she has a strong will, and I can make out her potential through the variety of skills she shows, however...)\r\nMirja: (Setouchi Chie said... She has known Asakura Mihono for a long time, and claims it's a result of her trouble concentrating. But I very much do not believe that is the full extent of it.)\r\nMirja: (What is holding her back...? If I could understand the cause, I could form a strategy to cope with it...)\r\nMirja: (In any case...)\r\nMirja: (However I look at it, this framework of an investigation team is incomprehensible. Every member is much too strongly idiosyncratic. On top of that, it's difficult to catch anything more than glimpses of their backgrounds. Despite being under the combined supervision of the five presidents, each seems to have an ulterior motive in sending them.)\r\nMirja: (Even President Souraku Yuzuki. For reasons I do not know, without any leads, her orders were to retrieve Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu at all costs...)\r\nMirja: (No...)\r\nMirja: (Knowing President Souraku, there must be a good reason behind this. I only need to carry out the mission she gave me.)\r\nMirja: (Right now, that is my role here!)\r\n\r\n4: Chie ~Duty to Your Cause, Duty to Your Heart~\r\n\r\nChie: (I'm a liar.)\r\nChie: (I...)\r\nChie: (I know what's really waiting for us at the end of this path. Knowing that, for my objective, I'm putting everyone in serious danger...)\r\nChie: (For Mokusa... The organization operating under Osafune Girls' Academy. The resistance formed to overthrow the head of the family, Origami Yukari.)\r\nChie: (As a member of that resistance, for Mokusa's sake, I was ordered to manipulate this investigation team.)\r\nChie: (For that sake, I lied... No... That's wrong. That's not right. I was a liar from the beginning.)\r\nChie: (Right from the start...)\r\nChie: (The day before the tournament, on my visit to Minoseki. I wasn't there to see Mihono-chan...)\r\nChie: (I was given a mission to deliver a secret message from Osafune's President Maniwa Sana to Minoseki's President Hashima Ema.)\r\nChie: (Even so, I missed her... I missed her so much, that I couldn't stop myself from seeing her... And because I got swept up with her, Mihono-chan became a part of this investigation team.)\r\nChie: (None of them know. Not just about me... That Aoto-kan's Youji-san and Hina-san help Mokusa. That Ellen-san and Kaoru-san are members of Mokusa.)\r\nChie: (Mihono-chan doesn't know. That I often exchange messages for President Maniwa Sana between Osafune and Minoseki.)\r\nChie: (That I was already on close terms with Minoseki's President Hashima Ema. That I was only sent to Kamakura in the first place to become a member of this investigation team.)\r\nChie: (These secrets turn into lies... These lies create more lies, upon lies, upon lies. All I am is lies at this point.)\r\nChie: (...But still, there's one thing that's true.)\r\nChie: (I don't want anyone to get hurt because of me. That's my only wish. From the start, I never wanted to lie to anyone...)\r\nChie: (It's my fault Mihono-chan is involved in this... So I have to do everything in my power to protect Mihono-chan. After all, I'm... I'm still Mihono-chan's onee-san.)\r\nChie: No matter what it takes...!\r\nMihono: Chii-nee? What was that about? Are you okay?\r\nChie: No, don't worry about it. Ahem. You can just trust your onee-san, okay?\r\nMihono: You're so weird, Chii-nee. That goes without saying; I know I can always rely on you!\r\nMihono: And not just me! Kiyoka-san, Mirja-san... Probably Kofuki-san too. We all know you're our reliable onee-chan!\r\nMihono: We're all counting on you, Chii-nee!\r\nChie: All of you...?\r\nKiyoka: Yes, all of us. You're like an onee-san to me too, Setouchi-san.\r\nChie: Ah..... W-Well, thank you. ...Now, we should keep moving!\r\n\r\n5: Kofuki ~Let's Dance!~\r\n\r\nKofuki: I can feel it! I'm alive! I'm burning up! Even the aradama just keep getting stronger! Shit! How much better can this get!?\r\nKofuki: I'll carve you! I'll break you! I'll devour you! I'll end you! Haha! Ahaha! Just like that, aradama-chan! I'll tear each and every one of you apart! I love you so much!\r\nKofuki: Ahhh... Ahhh, man! This investigation team's too good! When I'm with them, it's always happening!\r\nKofuki: Renpu's research lab, or when those guys in lab coats made me fight... That was all nothing compared to this! This is too much! I can't take it! It's so good I'm gonna cum...!\r\nKofuki: Ahh... Ahhh.... I get to cut as many as I want... I get to kill as many as I want! All I can feel for my president is thanks anymore!\r\nMihono: Wait! Kofuki-san! Chii-nee! Mirja-san! Kofuki-san ran off on her own again!\r\nMirja: I'm aware! Setouchi Chie-san! Follow her!\r\nChie: Understood!\r\n\r\n6: Kiyoka ~I Want to Run Away~ (1)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Pant... Pant... Um, why do we, why are we fighting? I thought we were only here to meet someone...\r\nKiyoka: And anyway, what is this place? Now that I'm up close, I can tell... This place is in ruins.\r\nMirja: Before, this used to be the American military's storehouse... This is where we were headed, but...\r\nMirja: What's the meaning of this? Why is it so abandoned?\r\nMihono: \"Renpu Girls' School, 5th Physiological Research Institute\" is written on the wall...? Renpu had a research lab in Tokyo?\r\nMirja: Shichonosato Kofuki, do you know anything about this?\r\nKofuki: Tch, like I'd know? We've got labs all over the place. I'm not gonna remember every single one.\r\nKofuki: Every last one of the researchers in these things is desperate for results that'd get our president interested.\r\nKofuki: You know already, don't you? Just what kinda person our president is.\r\nMihono: What kind, um... Well, she threw us into that surprise exam, didn't she? Ahh, now it's all coming back to me...\r\nMirja: So what you're saying is, this is one of the research institutes that was abandoned after they couldn't manage to please President Takatsu?\r\nMirja: I see. However, why are there more aradama the closer we draw near it? And...\r\nMihono: Why's there no end to them... Ah!? When did we get surrounded...!?\r\nKofuki: Heheh! What's the problem? We just get to keep crushing them for as long as we want? Right!\r\nKiyoka: Eh... You guys!? We're going to keep fighting? I-I'm feeling too scared to go on...\r\n\r\n7: Kiyoka ~I Want to Run Away~ (2)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Pant... Pant... Um, please, wait for me...\u3000\r\nMihono: Kiyoka, are you okay? We're all going inside the building now. If we hang around out here too long we'll end up fighting more than we have to.\r\nKiyoka: Ah, Um... S-Sorry. I'm so scared; my legs won't...\r\nKofuki: You stupid or what? For all we know, that building's so full of aradama it's about to explode.\r\nKofuki: Ahhh, man! I'm getting so damn excited!\r\nKiyoka: Then... I can't...\r\nKiyoka: I just don't want to fight anymore... It's scary, and it hurts, and I just can't... How are all of you so okay with this...\r\nMihono: Well, I'm scared too, to be honest.\r\nKiyoka: Eh...?\r\nMihono: There's no way I'd feel okay right now. I don't want to get hurt, or injured, and I could even die... It's just like you said.\r\nKiyoka: But, you're still...\r\nMihono: It's fine to feel like that, you know? Scared, and like you hate this. But we're all going to get through this together. We're teammates after all.\r\nKiyoka: ...Teammates...\r\nMirja: That's right, Musumi Kiyoka.\r\nMirja: You were the one who saved us back in Izu. Because you were able to buy us time, I was able to contact President Souraku.\r\nMirja: Right now, I consider you a member of this team.\r\nChie: Mirya-san's right. Besides, if you don't come along with us then we won't be able to help protect you, you know?\r\nMihono: See, Kiyoka? We all feel the same.\r\nKiyoka: Ah... Okay! Thank you... Asakura-san. I'm scared, and I want to run away... But I'll go with you!\r\n\r\n8: Mihono ~Someone Else's Feelings~\r\n\r\n???: ...Father, I did it, didn't I? I kept this world safe for her to live in.\r\nAsakura Yoshizumi: Yes. There's not a doubt in my mind you have. You're one of the heroes who changed this world, even if history may not remember it...\r\nYoshizumi: But, you left her with... Something far, far more precious. You gave her life, in all its brilliance.\r\n???: Thank you, father... Ahh... People are so greedy, aren't we.\r\n???: To leave her something, to keep her safe. And even then, I want more and more. For her to be happy...\r\n???: For her sake... Not just her, but all the world she'll see, wrapped in happiness... I can't help but wish for more.\r\n???: For her to find her own happiness, for her to live and be strong... These things... Are all I can think of.\r\nYoshizumi: No, you should think that. Desire isn't always a bad thing.\r\nYoshizumi: Love is simply the desire to make another happy. There is no one in the world who would deny you that.\r\n???: Father...\r\nYoshizumi: Mm, you don't have to worry. You can rest now. That girl will surely live to grow up strong. After all, she's Kanayago-sama's-\r\n\r\nKiyoka: ...Asakura-san?\r\nKiyoka: Asakura-san? What's the matter?\r\nMihono: Ah.... Huh? How long did I space out for? Ten minutes? Or, it felt more like thirty?\r\nKiyoka: Nothing like that; maybe five seconds?\r\nMihono: Five seconds...? Ah, okay. Sorry, I didn't mean to right before the final battle.\r\nMihono: (....Just now... Whose memory was that...?)\r\nKiyoka: Battle? We're not here to fight, remember? We're just going to meet with someone who knows about the Akabane swords.\r\nMihono: Haha, oh yeah, you're right. It'd be nice if we don't have to fight anymore.\r\nChie: Are you two ready? They should be waiting for us just beyond that door. Now's the time to stay focused.\r\nKiyoka: Ah, yes!\r\nMihono: Yeah, I got it...! Where there's a will, there's a way! That's all there is to it!\r\nMihono: (Let's get it together and go, Kiyomitsu. This isn't going to end with nothing happening. I don't know why, but I know it...)"}, {"paste_key": "CqpWT76U", "title": "9 - In the Ruins of Where It Began", "paste": "https://pastebin.com/raw/CqpWT76U", "timestamp": "", "hits": "233", "syntax": "\nNone ", "unix": -1, "expiration": "Never", "user": "", "data": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS4fBP1eNq0\r\n\r\n1: Waiting Alone, the One Known as Suruga (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: ...! Guys, there's something there!\r\n???: So you've come.\r\nChie: Who are you?\r\nMirja: That body... Too warped to call a human, but I've never heard of an aradama speaking?\r\nKofuki: Hmmm~? Heh, not bad... My school too.\r\nMirja: What do you mean, Shichinosato Kofuki...!? No, hang on. Are those... Akabane swords!?\r\nChie: Yes. There's no mistaking that rusted okatana she's holding. Not only that, but the pile she's sitting on. They're all Akabane swords.\r\nMirja: There must be hundreds in there. Where did they all come from...\r\nMirja: No, in the first place, we came here to meet someone who could answer the mystery behind the Akabane swords. So, would that person be you?\r\n???: Aah, that I am. The one you toji have sought out, the one you have come here to find. Without a doubt, that is I.\r\nMirja: And... All the things beneath your feet, those are Akabane swords, aren't they?\r\n???: Right. The Akabane swords.\r\nMirja: ...Then we're not making a mistake here, are we.\r\nMihono: H-Hang on a second! That means... You're the one using all these Akabane swords...?\r\n???: Right.\r\nMihono: Then... You were here? From here? Scattering all these swords?\r\n???: Right.\r\nMihono: I don't get it...!\r\nMihono: I thought you said we were coming here to find someone who could help us stop the Akabane swords!?\r\nMihono: But instead we find the culprit holding them, the one causing all these problems!?\r\nMihono: So, what? Mirja-san! Chii-nee! What's going on!? Give me an explanation!\r\nMirja: ......\r\n???: Why will you not speak. Then I will explain it for you. Simply, like this.\r\n???: You simply strike the ground as such. In this way, the noro is drawn out. And...\r\nAradama: SHAA-!\r\nAradama: KIKI....K-Ki-KIKIKIGIGIGIGI....\r\n???: You see?\r\nMihono: What the...!?\r\nKiyoka: ...Asakura-san!! Where she stabbed the ground, there's noro gathering...\r\nMihono: And it becomes aradama... What... So you've just been breeding aradama?\r\n???: Go, aradama, take revenge! They must be removed! Those who would oppose my revenge, let them be overrun!\r\n\r\n2: Waiting Alone, the One Known as Suruga (2)\r\n\r\nChie:  ...What's going on? We defeated all the aradama, but my spectrum finder is still...\r\nKiyoka: Y-Yes... It's still reacting, isn't it.\r\nChie: The reading is so much stronger than before, from her... What's going on here? What are you?\r\nSuruga: What am I. I have never thought to call myself anything, though... \"Suruga\". That is what they called me. That is my reply.\r\nSuruga: As to what I am, this will suffice....\r\nSuruga: Like you, I am one bound to the okatana.\r\n\r\n3: What Humans Achieved (1)\r\n\r\nSuruga: Yes, I am the same as you.\r\nKofuki: Kuku... Fufufufu... So that's how it is.\r\nMirja: Shichinosato Kofuki?\r\nKofuki: Hah, who'd have guessed. We really are the same.\r\nMirja: \"Really are the same\"? What are you saying?\r\nKofuki: Like I said, we're the same. Isn't that right! The one they called Suruga! Renpu made you, didn't they?\r\nSuruga: Renpu... I see. You too were their guinea pig.\r\nSuruga: Girl, if they toyed with you as they did with me, come here. You may join me together in revenge! You need no longer do their bidding!\r\nKofuki: ...... .......... ...............\r\nKiyoka: Shichinosato-san...?\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan...!?\r\nKofuki: Heh, no way.\r\nKofuki: I couldn't care less about enemies or allies or revenge or whatever.\u3000So long as there's aradama I get to rip, tear, and cut to pieces, I don't need anything else.\r\nKofuki: So anyway, let me take you apart. Cause you reek of the kinda aradama-chan I love!\r\nKofuki: C'mon, let's get to it! I'll smash you good!\r\n\r\n4: What Humans Achieved (2)\r\n\r\nSuruga: Is this it? Is this all toji of the Five Traditions can manage?\r\nMihono: What's with that armor? Is that her skin!? No matter how much we cut at it, it just keeps growing back!\r\nChie: Renpu went all out... No, is this what was born of the results of the Origami family's aradama research!?\r\nMihono: Chii-nee... People keep saying guinea pig and research results and whatever, but what... What are you talking about!?\r\nChie: Just what you think. The Origami family took the aradama toji have defeated... Took their noro, and repeated various experiments with it.\r\nChie: Fusing noro with animals, to be used as controllable biological weapons. Injecting noro into toji, to draw out its power.\r\nChie: In their experiments, they tried everything they could... No, even now they're still trying it. We at Osafune have been looking for a long time for concrete proof of it.\r\nMihono: But, that's insane... ...Wait!? Does that mean, the aradama Satsuki Yomi-san was using were...!?\r\nChie: Yes, without a doubt. The results of their research gone unchecked.\r\nKofuki: Heh, that's what I was saying. Satsuki Yomi shoots herself up with those drugs they squeeze out, and that's how she controls the aradama.\r\nMihono: ...This can't be real... I mean, we've all been fighting for the sake of justice... You can't tell me...\r\nMihono: So what!? Is she too... Is she one of the aradama the Origami family made!?\r\n\r\n5: The Sweetness Called Revenge (1)\r\n\r\nMihono: That makes her another victim of the Origami family and Renpu's aradama research, doesn't it...!?\r\nSuruga: Kuku.... Kukuku...! Victim, you said... You would actually call me a victim?\r\nSuruga: Aahh, you are right that I was born here, through what they called research. And, through what they called experiments, they would mutilate me...\r\nSuruga: Though... After failing to get the results they wanted, I found myself alone here.\r\nSuruga: This facility had been abandoned as well, as you can see from the state it is in. So, what is wrong with pursuing revenge with my newfound freedom?\r\nMirja: So that's your reason for using the Akabane swords, creating aradama, and attacking people?\r\nSuruga: Right. That is my revenge.\r\nSuruga: On the tongues that called me a waste. The ones that boasted they would \"protect the people\", all the while lying through their teeth. The Origami family... The toji... My revenge, turned against mankind!.\r\nMirja: I understand. You've made your case. Yet...\r\nMirja: We cannot allow you, who would use aradama to attack innocent people, to continue on.\r\nMihono: Wait, hang on! Suruga, she's still a victim here...\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono, do not allow yourself to be led astray. In the end, her reasoning still does not excuse her actions. There is nothing righteous about the things she has chosen to do.\r\nMirja: Isn't that right, Suruga. In your using of the Akabane swords to gather noro and breed aradama, you had no right using them to attack innocent people.\r\nMirja: That is why we will put an end to this, and retrieve all the Akabane swords here!\r\nSuruga: I see. Though, after all, you were always dogs of the Origami family. I never intended... On letting the likes of you survive!\r\n\r\n6: The Sweetness Called Revenge (2)\r\n\r\nKofuki: Tch! How can you be this tough!? It's like you've got steel for bones! ...Shit, the blade, got stuck!\r\nSuruga: What's the matter, girl. You were their guinea pig too. Do you not despise them? If you aid me in my revenge, I will allow you alone to live.\r\nKofuki: Hah! You're so damn dumb. Killing aradama is all I live for!\r\nKofuki: As long as I keep killing aradama they don't care, and as long as I get to keep killing aradama I don't care! Everything else can fuck right off!\r\nKofuki: Revenge!? That's just what you chose to do!\r\nSuruga: ...I see. You choose to die with your friends.\r\nKofuki: Ha? Moron-! Like I care about them!\r\nKofuki: All that matters is me and my prey!\r\nSuruga: Hmph!\r\n*Kofuki gets whacked away*\r\nKofuki: GAH... NGAHH!\r\nSuruga: ...So frail.\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan!\r\nChie: (Kofuki-chan's utsushi was down for just a moment then!? No!)\r\nKofuki: Gah... Gh... Nngh... Ah, gh...\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan! Hang on, you're injured...!\r\nKofuki: Fuck off, Chichie... I said not to get between me and her... Just leave me alone!\r\n*slap*\r\nMihono: (She got slapped!? Chii-nee just slapped her!?)\r\nKiyoka: (That sounded so strong I felt it from here!)\r\nKofuki: Nnuh.....?\r\nChie: There's no way I'm going to leave you alone!\r\nKofuki: Ah.... Nn....\r\nChie: Just fall back and recover as best you can for now! Do what your onee-san tells you!\r\nSuruga: What is with you all... Aah... It matters not. I will not give you any more time. I will be relentless until you fall.\r\nSuruga: GRRRRRRRROOOAAAAAAAAA! Now! You will die! Toji!\r\n\r\n7- Mirja's Sight (1)\r\n\r\n*all of them getting attacked*\r\nMihono: ....Damnit!\r\nKofuki: ....Tch!\r\nKiyoka: KYAA!\r\nChie: ....Ngh! We can't get through!\r\nSuruga: Grrrrrrrraahhh!\r\nMirja: Pant... Pant... Even with five of us, this is as best we can hold on!?\r\nMirja: We need a way to turn this around... I have no choice. This was my last resort.\r\nMirja: Investigation team! Clear away from Suruga for a moment!\r\nKiyoka: Eh? Mirja-san took off her glasses...\r\nMirja: At stage 2 jin'i... Here I go!\r\n*Suruga is hit with a flurry of slashes*\r\nSuruga: Gaaahhhh!? What... Have you done!?\r\nMirja: \"Kantougan\". Information is gathered from any opponent I cut, and in my sight is calculated all their weaknesses.\r\nMirja: And my sight is telling me...\r\nMirja: In your upper right arm, Fujiwara Kaneshige. In your right forearm, Bizen Osafune Yoshimitsu. In your right thigh, Aoe Shigetsugu. In your right lower leg, Udaku Nimune. Aside from those, there are 7 more... And in your spine, Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu... A replica.\r\nMirja: I understand now. You are simply noro gathered around a skeleton of Akabane swords.\r\nMirja: Far from being as complex as I thought, you are no different from the aradama born around the Akabane swords we have fought up until now.\r\nMirja: I am quite interested in the details of how an aradama could become intelligent enough for human speech, however...\r\nMirja: Against such a familiar opponent, the strategy becomes simple. First, we need to separate that mockery of a human form!\r\n\r\n8- Mirja's Sight (2)\r\n\r\nSuruga:\u3000Kkh... Gh... Gh... Gh... GGGGHHHHAAAAAA!\r\nChie: She can't keep her human shape together? Our attacks are working!\r\nChie: ...Wait!? Rather than falling apart, the remains of all the aradama in here are being drawn towards her!?\r\nSuruga: AHHHHHHGGGHHHHH!\r\n*Suruga turns into a giant aradama dragon*\r\nSuruga: AhhhhhhHHHHHH!\r\n\r\nMirja: Finally, her true form is exposed...\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMirja: What's the matter, Asakura Mihono?\r\nMihono: Hey, Mirja-san. If she dies, this will end, won't it?\r\nMihono: If Suruga dies here, the Akabane swords will stop being scattered, and there'll be less people getting hurt by aradama. That's how this is, right?\r\nMirja: ...Yes, I believe so. At the least, the spread of incidents should not increase. That I will promise you.\r\nMihono: Okay, I'll do it. If it means all those people out there won't have to suffer, I'll do it myself. With... With Kiyomitsu, I'll stop Suruga.\r\nMihono: So... Until the very end, please keep giving us orders.\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono...\r\nMirja: Very well. I understand. Then I ask you... No... All of you, please entrust yourselves to me.\r\nMihono: Thank you, Mirja-san!! Let's give it everything we've got, everyone! Please, I'm counting on you!\r\nKiyoka: Yes, I'm not... I'm not going to hold back!\r\nChie: Of course you can count on me.\r\nKofuki: .....\r\nChie: Kofuki-chan?\r\nKofuki: ...Tch.\r\nKofuki: ...Sure.\r\nMihono: Thanks, all of you! Mirja-san! Give us your orders!\r\nMirja: ...Then, let's begin.\r\nMirja: Investigation team! Form up! We will fight back the aradama... Fight back Suruga, prevent her from taking her grudge out on any more people, and retrieve the Akabane swords!\r\n\r\n9- The Annihilating Blade - Rondo (1)\r\n\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie! Push the attack forward! Shichonosato Kofuki, go wild! Until your utsushi runs out, act as berserk as you like! Musumi Kiyoka! Protect their backs!\r\nChie/Kofuki/Kiyoka: Understood!\r\nMihono: Mirja-san! What should I do!\r\nMirja: Wait for my signal! Until then, gather your strength!\r\nMihono: Eh... For what!?\r\nMirja: As noro gathers, it will become an \"individual\" and eventually take on a monstrous form. If you cut through this body, it will no longer be able to maintain that state and revert to its original one.\r\nMirja: However, things are different for a large aradama. The ordinary method is no longer effective with so much noro. As such...\r\nMirja: We will use our okatana to gradually wear away at Suruga's body. With nowhere left to go, the noro will gather closer towards a core in the center... Asakura Mihono, that's what you will aim for!\r\nMihono: Alright... I can do that!\r\nMirja: A good reply.\r\nMirja: Now, investigation team... Charge! This is the end! Cut open a path for Asakura Mihono!\r\n\r\n10- The Annihilating Blade - Rondo (2)\r\n\r\nMirja: Asakura Mihono! Go, now!\r\nMihono: Okay!\r\nKofuki: Whoa... Was she always that strong...?\r\nChie: Is this Mihono-chan's... Power as a toji?\r\nChie: Mihono-chan... You're incredible! ...Ah!?\r\nChie: ...An attack slipped through! From behind her!\r\nMihono: ...!?\r\nMihono: (I can't block it right!)\r\nChie: Mihono-chan's okatana flew out of her hands!?\r\nMirja: Gh! She made it so close... Is this it!?\r\nKiyoka: I won't let you stop her...!\r\nKiyoka: HONO-CHAN! CATCH!\r\nMihono: Thanks, Kiyoka... I got it! Let's go, Kiyomitsu... Let's finish this!\r\nMihono: AHHHHHHHHH!!!!\r\nSuruga: AAAAAGGGGGHHH...! AHHHHHHHHH...!\r\n\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: Phew...\r\nSuruga: ...You were... Asakura Mihono...?\r\nMihono: Suruga! You can still talk...!?\r\nSuruga: Aah... I was mistaken... Truly, the one like me... Was you...?\r\nMihono: ...What? What are you talking about? Like you?\r\nSuruga: Aahh, right. Your body, andmine...\r\n*Suruga dissolves*\r\nMihono: Hey! Wait!\r\nMihono: ......\r\nMihono: ...Oh... Right... She's just noro now... That means, this really is over...\r\n\r\n11: What Each Were After (1)\r\n\r\nKiyoka: Asakura-san! Congratulations! You did it!\r\nMihono: I did it... It wasn't a competition. Besides, we all won this together.\r\nKiyoka: I know, but, congratulations!\r\nMihono: Mmm------ Well, whatever. Thanks!\r\nMihono: Ah! Oh yeah, Kiyoka, earlier you called me \"Hono-chan\", didn't you!\r\nKiyoka: ~~~~~~! S-Sorry! I got carried away... It's just... I've been thinking, I wanted to call you that someday...\r\nKiyoka: So, I just...\r\nMihono: It's fine! Call me Hono-chan then! Also, at the end there, that was a really good throw! You got Kashuu Kiyomitsu right to me! I owe you one!\r\nKiyoka: No, well... That's about all I could do, so...\r\nKofuki: ............Tch.\r\n\r\nMirja: It's over now, isn't it. Thank you very much, Setouchi Chie-san.\r\nChie: I didn't really do anything worth thanking.\r\nChie: More importantly, the Akabane swords here... There's only one, maybe two hundred. This is nowhere near all of them. So where did they come from, and how did they get here?\r\nMirja: You're right... But regardless, we need to call in for the swords here to be retrieved. Though... There is one thing I cannot understand about all this.\r\nMirja: Suruga said... She was born here, as a victim of their experiments. But...\r\nChie: You mean why, if Suruga was holed up here, our information misled us into coming here?\r\nMirja: No, there's that too, but much more confusing is... Why would Renpu leave Suruga here? How could her actions remain overlooked for so long?\r\nChie: You're thinking that Renpu, knowing fully about the aradama they created here, intentionally left her to her own devices?\r\nMirja: On the contrary, I can't help but think the Origami family itself was involved in covering this up.\r\nMirja: Whatever the case, it's beyond our ability to do anything about now. Though I am finding it difficult to trust Renpu, and, with their influence over the administration, hesitate at the thought of handing in these swords.\r\nMirja: Because of that, I was wondering. Would you mind entrusting what we've found here directly to Ayanokouji Martial Arts School for the time being?\r\n\r\nChie: ...I can't let you do that.\r\nMirja: ...Setouchi Chie-san?\r\nChie: I don't trust President Souraku yet either. I can't trust them with the Akabane swords. And... To tell the truth, I can't trust you either, Kitora Mirja.\r\nChie: ...\"Namu Yakushi Rurikou Nyorai Kagemitsu\".\r\nMirja: !?\r\nChie: That's the name of the okatana you're here to recover, isn't it? Am I wrong?\r\nChie: I know you've been looking for it. So... When President Souraku gets her hands on it, what is she going to do?\r\nMihono: Chii-nee! Mirja-san! Let's get going alre...\r\nMihono: Eh... Huh? Wait. What are you two doing...? Why are both of you readying your okatana!?\r\nChie: I need you to tell me everything here, Kitora Mirja. What President Souraku... What Ayanokouji Martial Arts School is planning.\r\nMirja: I see... Then, Setouchi Chie-san. I have questions as well. What are you?\r\nMirja: Osafune gave us this lead intending to expose Suruga and the corruption of those in charge, didn't they. And you hid their true intentions when you led us here.\r\nMirja: In the first place, it was Osafune's Maniwa Sana who proposed the creation of this investigation team. So I have to ask, what is Osafune fighting against?\r\nChie: ......\r\nMirja: ......\r\nMihono: W-Wait! What's this all about!?\r\nChie: She... Mirja-san was ordered by Ayanokouji's President Souraku to retrieve that okatana, \"Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu\".\r\nChie: And she kept it a secret from us all this time.\r\nMihono: Uhh... Chii-nee...? Is she not supposed to do that? I don't really get it, but if she wants it, why not let her take it?\r\nChie: You would feel that way, Mihono-chan. But that's not how this works. I can't let her take it.\r\nChie: When it comes down to it, I want you to explain. But you have two choices here: either you convince all of us to let you take it, or you take it from me by force.\r\nKiyoka: Um, you two, could you please calm down and maybe talk this over? Ah! Shichinosato-san, help us stop them!\r\nKofuki: Huh? Just let 'em do what they want. This's getting interesting.\r\nKiyoka: Ehh!? S-Shichinosato-san... U-Um! Fighting amongst teammates is bad, you two! W-Why did it come to this...!?\r\nChie: I wonder that myself, Kiyoka-chan. I wish this could have gone more smoothly. But this is something I'm not able to let her get away with.\r\nMirja: I understand... The two of us both have reasons we can't afford to back down from. I had hoped it wouldn't come to this, but...\u3000It seems this will only be settled through our okatana.\r\n*The two of them draw their swords*\r\nMihono: Chii-nee! Mirja-san! Cut it out! Actually, just get over it!\r\nMihono: We're only here to fight the aradama! Why are you two fighting each other!? Seriously! I don't get it!\r\n*Mihono draws her sword*\r\nMihono: Fine! If you two want to fight, then I'll fight you! You both have to get through me first! I won't use utsushi either! This is a fight for real!\r\nChie: Mihono-chan... Stay out of this.\r\nMihono: You can shut up, Chii-nee! Aghh, the sky can shut up too!\r\n*Helicopter noises*\r\nMihono: What is that sound anyway... A helicopter? Out the window, that's... The Special Ritual Riot Squad helicopter? What's it doing here, now...\r\n\r\nYuzuki: That's far enough, Mirja. You, from Osafune, as well. Please put your okatana away.\r\n\r\n12: What Each Were After (2)\r\n\r\nYuzuki: That's far enough, Mirja. You, from Osafune, as well. Please put your okatana away.\r\nMihono: (That's... Ayanokouji Martial Arts School's President Souraku Yuzuki. This is the first time I've seen her in person...)\r\nYuzuki: ...Yes, that is Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu... A secret weapon to be used against a great aradama. You've done well, Mirja. We can get a sword polisher to return it to its original state at once.\r\nChie: ......!\r\nYuzuki: Don't make such a scary face. I've already spoken to your President Maniwa in regards to this.\r\nChie: With my president...? What do you mean?\r\nYuzuki: All of you should listen closely.\r\nYuzuki: Right now, a great aradama has its roots deep in our world. Very likely one that is greater and stronger than any humanity has ever faced.\r\nMirja: ...President Souraku? What are you saying all of a sudden...\r\nYuzuki: Do you not think it's strange?\r\nYuzuki: The miraculous advancements made with computers and the discoveries involving the laws of physics. Even close to you, the creation of the tool that greatly supports a toji's abilities, Osafune's \"Storm Armor\".\r\nYuzuki: Since the turn of the century, we have achieved things that should have been far beyond our reach. The likes of what were once pure science fiction.\r\nYuzuki: Suppose all of this was due to the influence of an aradama? Suppose that, in our everyday lives, we are resting comfortably in the palm of an aradama's hand.\r\nMihono: Wait... I mean, please wait. That's all hypothetical, right? Because, if you're telling the truth...\r\nYuzuki: Then it would be necessary to find a means of retaliating against such a great aradama. A secret weapon humanity can keep close at hand. That's why... I believe there's nothing other than this Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu.\r\nYuzuki: What do you think, Setouchi Chie. You must understand some of what I'm getting at.\r\nChie: ...Yes. However, I want to take it with me to be sure.\r\nYuzuki: I don't mind. Go right ahead.\r\nKiyoka: Um, so does this mean... That our investigation team will be broken up here?\r\nMihono: Ah! I didn't think of that! But we did collect the Akabane swords, and we did stop Suruga who was scattering them...\r\nKiyoka: Yes. So it's over now, isn't it?\r\nYuzuki: No, I would like for you to continue.\r\nYuzuki: Your investigation into the Akabane swords will continue, operating under the supervision of the five presidents as before. You'll keep the relative independence to your investigation as well.\r\nYuzuki: Additionally... I'd like to add an additional mission: locate Namu Yakushi Rurikou Nyorai Kagemitsu.\r\nYuzuki: The Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu you found this time is still no more than a replica... Simply an imitation of the original, and nothing more.\r\nYuzuki: You will track down the remaining Akabane swords, and among them you will find the true Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu.\r\nYuzuki: And also, Setouchi Chie.\r\nChie: ...Yes?\r\nYuzuki: I'm leaving this okatana with you. As far as sword polishing goes, you could leave that to Mirja.\r\nChie: As proof I can trust you... No, you're exchanging this for my trust. Is that what this means?\r\nYuzuki: If that's how you see it then that's fine. Now then, this is where I take my leave.\r\n\r\nMirja: Setouchi Chie-san. I...\r\nChie: .........\r\nChie: ...Sigh.\r\nChie: I'm beat... All the tension's been sucked out of the air. There's no way I can continue our fight like this. So how about we call it a truce, for now?\r\nMirja: Agreed. I'm very glad to hear that.\r\nKiyoka: Everything's alright now!\r\nMihono: Eh? Huh?

Don't act like we're close...!\r\nMihono: Huh~~? You're the one who told me to call you Fukki, remember, Fukki~~?\r\nKofuki: Nngh...!\r\nChie: Okay, okay, break it up, you two.\r\nMihono: Okay~!\r\nKofuki: ...'kay.\r\nChie: Fufu~. Now, leaving that aside...\r\nChie: We can't hang around here forever. We can leave the recovery of the Akabane swords to the people at headquarters, so let's get going.\r\nChie: Normally we'd go right back to the office in Kamakura, but... I think we deserve a treat, so how about we go eat some sweets? I saw a crepe shop just by the station. What do you think, Captain Mirja?\r\nMirja: Fufu, that sounds like a good plan. Then... One more time! \r\nMirja: Investigation team! Move out, and recover the crepes!\r\nMihono/Kiyoka/Chie: Yeah-!\r\nKofuki: ...Yeah.

They are here to participate in an operational test of the newly developed Storm Armor, produced through the collaborative efforts of both the Sword Administration Bureau and United States military. On that same day, another toji arrives in Okinawa: Tsubakuro Yume, sixth year elementary school student of Ayanokouji Martial Arts School. The girls have no knowledge of and share no connection with each other. For now. This is a record of the hidden conflict these girls encounter, caught in a scheme involving the Storm Armor, as Hokuto, Suu, and Yume, as well as the elite guard and Mokusa, cross swords. This story, taking place one year before the events of the anime, is Toji no Miko's first novelization!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n------ DRAMA CD ------\r\nhttps://mega.nz/folder/yvBBUAYD#t0KpE55s8jbPuR_a3-ByHg\r\nAll in one folder, with individual links below.
