## [Casual '20 - Ellen: Start\]: The Pair's New Year's Eve
**Aradama:** GUOOOOO\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** They're still coming\? Oi, Aradama, could you at least take it easy on New Year's Eve\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, complaining to the aradama won't do you any good\. We're nearly through with this year's missions\. Let's give it one last push\!  
**Ellen:** I'm going in\! HAAAAAAAAAAAH\!  
**Aradama:** Keeeee\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Alright, guess that's it for this year's slave labor\. Another long year jammed with work after work\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Good job pulling through another year\! Or, that's what I'd like to say, but\.\.\. the spectrum finder is still picking something up\.  
**Kaoru:** Sigh\.\.\. Everybody else's already on their New Year's break, but we don't even get this or Obon off\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Nee\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, Nene, there's not much left to do, so let's try our best\! After this mission's over, there's my Papa and Mama's countdown party waiting for us\!  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, that's right\. The luxury party they rented out a huge room at a high class hotel for\.  
**Ellen:** With delicious food, and all the amazing sweets you could want\! So let's finish this mission quick, so we can make it in time for the party\.  
**Kaoru:** Well, it's true that, after all the work we've done, you'd want spend at least the very end of the year getting treated for it\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Kaoru:** Sigh\.\.\. I can't do any more after this\. There can't be any more of them, right\?  
**Ellen:** You did great\! It seems we cleared out the aradama, so that means this year's missions are finally complete\!  
**Ellen:** If we race back to the party now, we should make it in time for the countdown\! Let's hurry\!  
**Kaoru:** Nobody's here\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Nee\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Apparently the party ended while we were stuck in traffic\. Sorry to disappoint you, Kaoru\.  
**Kaoru:** Nah, it's fine\. This is just how things go for us cogs in the system\.\.\. It's actually the perfect New Year's for drones like us\. Come on, might as well go home and go to bed\.  
**Ellen:** Hold on a moment\! Over there, there's one table with food still laid out\!  
**Kaoru:** Ohh, you're right\! Don't tell me they left it for us\?  
**Ellen:** That's what it looks like\. There's a message card from Papa and Mama, and a New Year's Present too\.  
**Kaoru:** Present\? This envelope done up in a ribbon\? What's inside\?  
**Ellen:** It's a keycard\.  
**Kaoru:** A keycard\? And where does that get us into\?  
**Ellen:** Fufu\. That's something you can look forward to finding out later\!  
**Ellen:** Anyway, Kaoru, we might not have made it in time for the countdown, but let's celebrate New Year's\.  
**Ellen:** Let's start with a toast\! Kaoru, Nene, thanks so much for everything this past year\. I'm looking forward to spending the next year with you too\.  
**Ellen:** Cheers\!  
**Kaoru:** Fwah, I'm stuffed\. My stomach's too full to move anymore\.  
**Nene:** Nee\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** I'm glad it put you back in a better mood\!  
**Ellen:** I just got a message from Kanamin\. Wow\! So she and Hiyoyon went and did their first shrine visit\. Take a look, Kaoru; they look like they're having fun in this picture\.  
**Kaoru:** Hahah\.\.\. Those are some nice smiles\. Look at them, enjoying their New Year's break\.  
**Ellen:** There's more too\. \"We're going to the mountaintop now to see the first sunrise\. Do you and Kaoru-chan want to join us\?\"  
**Kaoru:** The first sunrise\.\.\. Sorry, but I'm dead after that mission, and, after eating that much, I don't have it in me to go out again\.  
**Kaoru:** Besides, I'm not even sure I can stay up till sunrise\. And there's just no way I'm climbing up a mountain and sitting in the cold until it comes up\.  
**Kaoru:** Seriously, the timing this year's been the worst right out the gate\.  
**Nene:** Nee\.  
**Ellen:** Come on and cheer up, Kaoru, Nene\. I've got a good idea\!

## [Casual '20 - Ellen: End\]: The Happy New Year Plan
**Kanami:** Ellen-chan, Kaoru-chan, Happy New Year\!  
**Hiyori:** Leave it to Ellen to have a room at a fancy hotel like this for a party\.  
**Ellen:** Kanamin, Hiyoyon, thanks for coming\. And, Happy New Year to you too\.  
**Kaoru:** Oi, Ellen, it's great and all you called those two here, but we're already done with the food\.  
**Ellen:** I know\. Now that Kanamin and Hiyoyon are here, let's move on to the next attraction\!  
**Kaoru:** The next attraction\?  
**Ellen:** We'll take the keycard Papa and Mama left us and go someplace nice\!  
**Kanami:** Someplace nice\? Hiyori-chan, don't you want to go see\!  
**Hiyori:** Why not\. Since she asked us to call off our plans to see the sunrise, whatever it is must be something amazing\.  
**Ellen:** We're here\!  
**Kaoru:** And where's \"here\"\.\.\.\?  
**Ellen:** The members-only lounge on the hotel's top floor\! The sunrise you can see from up here is very beautiful\.  
**Hiyori:** So that's why\. It's hard to tell since it's still night out, but I'm sure a floor this high gets a good view of it\.  
**Kanami:** Thanks, Ellen-chan\! Now if it could only be sunrise already-\.  
**Ellen:** It's still going to take a while, so let's have some tea while we wait\! Here, Kaoru, some warm milk tea for you\.  
**Kaoru:** Fwahh\~, that's good stuff\. Sitting out in the cold until the sun came up wasn't gonna happen, but I feel like I could wait for hours like this\.  
**Kaoru:** The heater's working, the sofa's sucking me in\.\.\. Yawnn\.\.\. Getting sleepy\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** [snooze\.\.\.\]  
**Nene:** Nenee\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Kaoru-chan fell asleep just sitting down, huh\.  
**Hiyori:** She must be tired, since she was working missions all the way to New Year's Eve\.  
**Ellen:** How about we let her sleep like this until the sunrise\.  
**Kaoru:** [sleepy breathing\.\.\.\]  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, wake up now\. The sun's just about to come up\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Nn\? Feels like Ellen's voice is right in my ear\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Ah-- I must've passed out on your lap at some point\.  
**Ellen:** Yes, you were sleeping like a baby\.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, the sun's going to be coming up out the windows over there\. Let's go see\.  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, I'd love to go see it, but\.\.\. Between this cushy sofa and your lap, I'm feeling so cozy my body's refusing to get up\.  
**Nene:** Nee\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Even while we're talking, I feel like I'm about to drift off again\.\.\. Sorry Ellen, for being like this first thing in the year\.  
**Ellen:** It's alright, Kaoru\. Even like this, you can still see out the window\.  
**Ellen:** Ah, looks like the sun is out\.  
**Kaoru:** You're right\. The morning sun's shining real bright\.  
**Ellen:** It's looking to be another good year\. Happy New Year, Kaoru\. Let's stay strong and give it our best this year too\.

## [Dress '20 - Yukari: Start\]: Recognition Party Put in Motion
**Yume:** I wanna have a party\!  
**Yukari:** A party\?  
**Maki:** Where's this coming from all of a sudden, Yume\?  
**Yume:** The onee-sans who were in the Miss Five Traditions contest are all getting together for a party\!  
**Yume:** So we should do it too\!  
**Suzuka:** If that's what you meant, then I've heard about it as well\.  
**Suzuka:** Though, it seemed to be more of a recognition party than a simple gathering\.  
**Yukari:** A recognition party\? If that's how it is, I should be the one to host it\.  
**Maki:** You'll host it, Yukari-sama\?  
**Yukari:** Miss Five Traditions was something I carried out\. Which should make a recognition party my responsibility\.  
**Suzuka:** In that case, I'll make arrangements for the location\.  
**Yukari:** Please do\.  
**Yomi:** Then, I'll take care of the food\.  
**Yukari:** Right\.  
**Maki:** Yume and I will do something to cover for our regular duties\.  
**Yume:** If we're suppressing aradama, just leave it to me\.  
**Yukari:** Then, I'm depending on you\.  
**Elite Guard:** Yes ma'am\!  
**Sana:** You're doing a recognition party\?  
**Yukari:** I've already told Ema and the others\. Could you fit it in your schedules, Sana, Yuzuki\?  
**Yuzuki:** That's fine with me, but, isn't this party for the girls who appeared in Miss Five Traditions\?  
**Yuzuki:** Wouldn't it be better to keep ourselves out of the way\?  
**Sana:** I can imagine Kaoru wouldn't be too happy about it\.  
**Yukari:** I'd like to keep it private, but, if I'm the one to host it, that won't be possible\.  
**Yukari:** Everyone involved in Miss Five Traditions will be invited too\.  
**Yuzuki:** \.\.\.So that's how it is\.  
**Yukari:** I want you two to handle things on that end\.  
**Sana:** So you want the toji kept free of any unnecessary hassling\.  
**Yuzuki:** It's bound to happen\.  
**Yukari:** Then, I'm relying on you for the day of\.  

## [Dress '20 - Yukari: End\]: Recognition Party
**Maki:** Yukari-sama, we've finished organizing the tables\.  
**Yukari:** And the food\?  
**Yomi:** There are no issues\.  
**Suzuka:** Right now, they're setting drinks at the tables\.  
**Yukari:** I see\.  
**Yume:** I drank a little bit of it, and it was really tasty\.  
**Suzuka:** Oh my, where are your manners\?  
**Yume:** It was just a little bit though\?  
**Yukari:** You've done well\. You should all get changed too\.  
**Maki:** Yes ma'am\.  
**Yume:** I can't wait to see our dresses\!  
**Suzuka:** I'll help pick out accessories for you\.  
**Yume:** Great-\!  
**Yomi:** Konohana-san, could you help me too\?  
**Suzuka:** Very well\. And of course, you'd like me to coordinate your outfit as well, Maki-san\?  
**Maki:** Sure; I'd appreciate it, Suzuka\.  
**Yuzuki:** How is everything coming along\?  
**Yukari:** Yuzuki\. Nothing's come up; it's all going smoothly\.  
**Sana:** I passed by Ellen earlier\. You got some good dresses ready for them, Yukari-senpai\.  
**Yukari:** Only what seemed appropriate\.  
**Sana:** There's a gathering starting to form by now\.  
**Yuzuki:** We should say our hellos\.  
**Sana:** What about you, Yukari-senpai\?  
**Yukari:** I think I'll join you\.  
**Mihono:** Yukari-sama\!  
**Yukari:** Asakura Mihono\.  
**Mihono:** Thanks so much for today\!  
**Mihono:** You threw this party because I said I wanted to do a thank you party\.\.\. didn't you\?  
**Yukari:** It's nothing you should concern yourself over\.  
**Yukari:** From the start, I was the one who prepared the Miss Five Traditions contest\. If there was going to be a recognition party, I should be the one in charge of it\.  
**Mihono:** At first, I was thinking, let's all go do karaoke\! But, seeing it turn into such a big party is really surprising\.  
**Yukari:** Did I spoil your plans\?  
**Mihono:** Not at all\! Actually, I'm really excited to see what kind of food they bring out and stuff\!  
**Yukari:** You girls are the stars of this party\. You should enjoy it to your heart's content\.  
**Mihono:** I will\!

## [Fantasy - Hiyori: Start\]: Welcome to the World of Fantasy
**Tsugumi:** Thank you for participating in today's test of our new training simulation system, Juujou-san, Morishita-san\.  
**Hiyori:** I don't mind helping, but\.\.\. Why is Morishita-san here\? She's from the equipment department, isn't she\?  
**Kihiro:** That would be to seek out inspiration, Miss Juujou\!  
**Hiyori:** Miss Juujou\.\.\.\?  
**Kihiro:** I may be a gen\~ius, but constant output runs the well of my talents dry\!  
**Kihiro:** Sometimes I like to get myself in harm's way\~\!  
**Hiyori:** I-Is that right\.\.\.  
**Kihiro:** Now then, Miss Juujou\! Let's go on our grand adventure\!  
**Tsugumi:** Morishita-san, I hadn't finished explaining for Juujou-san yet\.  
**Kihiro:** Whoops, how rude of me\! I was getting ahead of myself\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Juujou-san\?  
**Hiyori:** I-I'm fine\. Just, getting a little overwhelmed by Morishita-san\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Please keep up as best you can\.  
**Tsugumi:** This VR based combat training will be using a fantasy theme\.  
**Hiyori:** Fantasy\?  
**Tsugumi:** The enemies are still aradama, of course\.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, since we can make use of VR, there were requests for us to make it more fun to train in\.  
**Kihiro:** And so we're able to take a great journey across the world of fantasy\~\!  
**Hiyori:** I got it\. So long as I can still fight aradama like usual, there won't be an issue\.  
**Kihiro:** You're very reliable, Miss Juujou\! I'll do all I can to support you too\~\!  
**Hiyori:** Support me\? What are you going to be doing in VR, Morishita-san\?  
**Kihiro:** The character I'm playing is a support type\! I can use simple attack magic of course, but giving support from the rear is my specialty\!  
**Kihiro:** I'll give you just the support you need, Miss Juujou\!  
**Hiyori:** Y-You will then\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** With that, let's start setting things up\.  
**Tsugumi:** Data from your training will be collected automatically, so, once you've decided you've done enough, go and defeat the final boss\. The simulation will end then\.  
**Kihiro:** Understood, Miss Ban\! Let's bring down the final boss together, buddy\!  
**Hiyori:** Y-Yeah\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.I'm not so sure about this\.\)  

## [Fantasy - Hiyori: End\]: Cheering Drone\!
**Aradama:** GYAAGYAA\!  
**Hiyori:** Gh\.\.\. Their attack power keeps going up\.\.\.\!  
**Kihiro:** At times like these, leave it to me\! Activate magic: Cheering Drone\!  
**Kihiro:** Go now, Miss Juujou\! Bring down the aradama while your defense is boosted\!  
**Hiyori:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAAA\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Thanks, Morishita-san\.  
**Kihiro:** It's only reasonable I'd do this much\!  
**Kihiro:** By the way, along with boosting defenses, Cheering Drone has one more hidden effect\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** D-Does it\.\.\.\?  
**Hiyori:** (I wasn't sure how this would turn out, but things are going well so far\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (\.\.\.Though, it's hard keeping up with Morishita-san\.\)  
**Kihiro:** You know, this was more intriguing than I was expecting\! Miss Ban and her team have done a good job\!  
**Hiyori:** She's right that this feels more like a game than usual training\. This should make it easy for toji who don't like practicing to get into\.  
**Kihiro:** And it would be even more fun forming a party with friends\~\!  
**Kihiro:** If I could request something, I'd want for it to be enhanced into a fully open world style VR game\.  
**Kihiro:** Add in a plethora of skills, and it would fly off shelves if put out for sale\. Then research funds would come pouring in\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Leaving that aside, did you get any inspiration for making equipment\?  
**Kihiro:** I certainly did\! The spark of inspiration's shining bright\! My plan is to shut myself in the laboratory as soon as we return\!  
**Hiyori:** Alright\. We've fought enough battles, so we should be ready\.  
**Hiyori:** She told us the training ends when we beat the final boss\.\.\.  
**Kihiro:** We can travel through the map to the final boss room at any time\. Are you prepared to go\?  
**Hiyori:** Yeah, let's go\.  
**Tsugumi:** Thank you for going through the training\. This allowed me to get some nice data\.  
**Hiyori:** That's good\.  
**Tsugumi:** You can do it some other day, but I want you to submit a report on your personal experience with it\.  
**Hiyori:** Got it\. Though, it was pretty incredible\.  
**Hiyori:** It was like we really were on a fantasy adventure\.  
**Kihiro:** Miss Ban\! Whenever you're going to update this game, please let me know\!  
**Kihiro:** I'd like to make equipment for it\~\!  
**Tsugumi:** That\.\.\. does sound interesting\.  
**Kihiro:** Some equipment might be too dangerous to use in the real world, but, inside there, woohoo\!  
**Tsugumi:** Fufu, I could get some good data from that\.  
**Kihiro:** Miss Ban\!  
**Tsugumi:** Morishita-san\!  
**Hiyori:** (I get the feeling two people who should never team up just got put together\.\.\.\)
