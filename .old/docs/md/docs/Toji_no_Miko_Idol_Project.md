## 1: Forming an Idol Unit\!\?
One day, after school, Mihono was called into the office\.

  
**Maki:** Good, you're here, Asakura Mihono\. We're going to have you handle a request from the Sword Administration Bureau's Public Relation's department\.  
**Mihono:** A request from the PR department\?  
**Maki:** That's right\. You know the Five Tradtion's Unified Cultural Festival will be held soon, don't you\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, even we're talking about it a whole bunch\. Like, what it's going to be like this year\.  
**Maki:** On stage at the cultural festival, they'd like for there to be a performance with singing and dancing-- which you'll be in charge of\.  
**Mihono:** H\.\.\. HUHHHHHHHHHH\~\~\!\? I'll be on stage\?  
**Mihono:** Wait, and singing and dancing\.\.\. Is that like an idol\!\?  
**Maki:** It's reasonable to be shocked hearing this\. But, this request comes with a legitimate purpose behind it\.  
**Maki:** For us to continue our work as toji, it's vital that we have the people's understanding on our side\.  
**Maki:** We can't be an unapproachable organization\. Don't you think we need to show our friendly side sometimes, planning things like this to improve our image\?  
**Mihono:** Th-That makes sense\.\.\. The more you talk about it, the more I'm starting to get a handle on it\.  
**Maki:** It might sound like a crazy idea, but this assignment has gotten approval from Yukari-sama herself\. Be sure you take it seriously\.  
**Maki:** Now, there's no limit to the number of people who can join you on stage, but, if you get a good reception at the cultural festival, you'll be routinely asked to join in future events\.  
**Maki:** So choose your members carefully\. It'd be best to pick people you know closely and can work together well with\.  
**Mihono:** Okay\! I never thought I'd be becoming an idol, but\.\.\. I'm starting to get kinda excited\.  
**Mihono:** I'm sure that, where there's a will, there's a way\! I'll try my best to liven up the cultural festival\!  
**Mihono:** So anyway, guys\! Please help me out-\!  
**Chie:** Asking us to do idol activities is a a little surprising\.\.\. Though, maybe she's right that showing that side of ourselves will make people more comfortable with us\.  
**Mirja:** I think you made the right decision bringing this to us\. We'll be able to make use of our usual coordination as members of the investigation team on stage\.  
**Kofuki:** If it's a mission then there's not a whole lot we can do about it, but what a pain in the ass\. All I wanna be going after is aradama-chan\.  
**Tsugumi:** You truly have a one track mind, Shichinosato-san\.  
**Yui:** Mfufu\~, so basically, this means I'll get to see all of you dressed up like cute idols, right\? In that case, it gets a total OK from me\!  
**Kiyoka:** (E\.\.\. Everyone looks like they're kind of enjoying this\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** (But, just imagining singing and dancing in front of people is enough to make my heart pound\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** (There's still time before the cultural festival though\.\.\. If I practice a lot, even I should be fine, right\.\.\.\?\)  
**Mihono:** Alright then, let's get started right away\! We'll practice singing first\!  
**Kofuki:** So wait, why's Mihocchi acting like we all decided she'd be leader\?  
**Mihono:** Heheh\. That's because I want to be the center of our idol group\! That means I've gotta be the leader, right\?  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono has an appeal that draws people in\. She would be an ideal leader for idol activities\.  
**Yui:** That's for sure-\. Though, I feel like, deciding on the center is a totally different issue\.  
**Mihono:** You mean you don't think I'm good enough to be the center\!\?  
**Mihono:** Uuuu, I'll have to work hard to build up your faith in me first\.\.\.  
**Chie:** For now, let's use our free time starting today to do singing and dance lessons\.  
**Tsugumi:** We still have our usual missions to take care of, so this could get busy\.  
**Mirja:** Additionally, if we are acting as idols, we should begin by spreading recognition of us as a group\.  
**Mihono:** We should\?  
**Mirja:** Yes\. I can imagine a large difference in the excitement at our performance depending on how well our name is known\. Which is why it's essential for us to prepare a space to announce our unit's formation\.  
**Mirja:** To that end, this may sound sudden, but we should begin planning our debut live\. As soon as we settle on the details, we will make an announcement and carry it out\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ehh\!\? A-Already\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Why bother doing anything we don't have to-\? You're making more work for me here too\.  
**Kiyoka:** (I-I still don't feel prepared for this at all either\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** (How is this going to go for us\.\.\.\?\)  

## 2: We're Now in Special Training\!
Mihono and the others spent days doing idol activites alongside their usual aradama suppression missions\.

  
**Mirja:** With this, the aradama have been fully eliminated\. Good work\.  
**Yui:** Kofuki-san, the way you were moving during the fight was really idol-like\. You're actually getting pretty into that, aren't you\?  
**Kofuki:** Huh\? As if\. We just keep doing those dance lessons every day, so it comes out sometimes with how my feet move\.  
**Yui:** I want to get a recording, so do it one more time for me please\! With a big bright smile, if you can\!  
**Kofuki:** I'm not doing it\! And don't record anything\!  
**Chie:** There are times when your dance moves start to become a sort of habit though, aren't there\?  
**Mirja:** It feels as though my body is lighter on my feet than before\. You could say that's an unexpected benefit\.  
**Kiyoka:** (Everyone's already gotten used to our idol activities, but I'm still not even close\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** (I have to at least try hard enough not to hold them back\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** Alright\! Suppressing aradama's over with, so let's start our lesson-\!  
**Mihono:** We can start off with dancing today\. Everybody, try to match me\!  
**Mirja:** I see Asakura Mihono is motivated\. Is that how much she wanted the position of center\?  
**Chie:** As soon as she makes up her mind, Mihono-chan's motto is to leap before she looks\. I'll have to work hard too, as her onee-san\.  
**Yui:** One, two\.\.\. Ah, I did it really good just then\! I think I'm getting a lot more used to dancing-\.  
**Tsugumi:** That's true\. At this pace, we could be plenty ready for the main performance--  
**Kiyoka:** KYAA\.\.\.\!\?  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka\! Are you okay\?  
**Kiyoka:** I-I'm sorry\. I can't follow the choreography right for some reason\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** You're stiffening up too much, Kiyoka\. This part's not really that hard, so just take it easy\.  
**Kiyoka:** Okay\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Phew, I think we can call our lesson there for today\. Great work, guys-\!  
**Kiyoka:** Good work\. Um, I'll be leaving early\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** (What should I do\.\.\. Like I thought, I'm the only one weighing everyone down\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** (Maybe it would be best if I took myself out of the group, before I bother everyone even more\.\.\.\)  
**Yui:** Kiyoka-chan's looking like something's got her down\. You think she's still feeling nervous\?  
**Mirja:** That's more than likely the case\. From our pitch lessons, she's already struggling to bring out her voice\.  
**Chie:** If only she didn't worry herself so much over it\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Worry herself so much\?  
**Chie:** Mmhm\. She left early again today\.  
**Yui:** She might be trying to make it so she can leave the group\.  
**Mihono:** She can't do that\! It's the big cultural festival, so we have to make it all work together\!  
**Mihono:** If she's worried about messing up, I do that all the time, so she shouldn't let it get to her\. We've gotta catch up to her quick and convince her\!  
**Tsugumi:** I think that would have the opposite effect\. It's possible it would make her more worried\.  
**Mirja:** In that case, why not try giving her a different sort of assignment, to get her mind off it\?  
**Mirja:** Even the slightest change of pace could make her feel surprisingly more at ease\.  
**Kofuki:** If that's what we're doing, what if we let her mess around with the stage outfits and stuff\? She's into clothes, right\?  
**Mihono:** Fukki\.\.\. That might be a great idea\!  
**Kiyoka:** You want me to arrange everyone's outfits\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\. Our outfits for this were provided by the Five Traditions, but they said we're allowed to make some changes to the designs\.  
**Mihono:** Since you know a lot about fashion and stuff, I really wanted you to be in charge of it\.\.\. But, what do you think\?  
**Kiyoka:** Nnn\~\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** (Right now, I can't be useful when it comes to singing or dancing\. So, if I can at least help with the outfits\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** Alright\.\.\. If you're fine with me doing it, I'll handle them\.  
**Mihono:** Really\? Thanks a bunch\!  
**Kiyoka:** (With this\.\.\. Even if it's only a little, I hope I can help everyone\.\)  

## 3: Toji Idols, Beginning Activities\!
To get ideas for arranging the outfits, Kiyoka and Mihono went window shopping\.

  
**Mihono:** Leave it to Harajuku to have shops everywhere\!  
**Mihono:** It's been a while since I went to check out western clothes, so this is sorta fun\. Ah, look at that, Kiyoka\. That skirt's so cute\!  
**Mihono:** It really feels girly\~, y'know\? What do you think about making our outfits more like that\?  
**Kiyoka:** I do think it's cute, but\.\.\. With Mirja-san wearing them too, I think it might be better for our outfits to be a little more adult\.  
**Mihono:** Hmhm, I got it\. Then, how about the clothes over there\?  
**Mihono:** It has that, \"grown up woman\!\" feeling to it\. Isn't that cool\?  
**Kiyoka:** You're right\. Mirja-san or Chie-san would probably look great in it\. I think would shine on stage too\.  
**Kiyoka:** But\.\.\. This time, I feel like it might not look quite as good on the two of us\.　Kind of like we're trying too hard\.  
**Mihono:** Mmm, you have a point\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, look at that, Hono-chan\! That outfit\!  
**Mihono:** Wow, that's so pretty looking\.\.\.\!\! I'd love to wear something like that\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** With this, I'm sure it could look great on everyone\! Maybe it'd be good to arrange the outfits like that\.  
**Kiyoka:** We can leave the silhouette as-is\.\.\. For the length of the skirt, can we go even shorter\?  
**Kiyoka:** We can make it easier to move in, to fit us better\.\.\. Mm, this could work\! When I get back, I'll try this design out straight away\!  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan\! What do you think of this\?  
**Mihono:** ---\! That's good\! That's so good, Kiyoka\!\! I'm so glad you're a part of this\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.You think so\? But, all I've been doing is holding the group back\.  
**Mihono:** If you weren't here, we'd be in a lot of trouble with the outfits\. See, you know how my suggestions always miss something\.  
**Kiyoka:** Even if I weren't here\.\.\. Kofuki-san has great fashion sense, so I'm sure you would have come up with something\.  
**Mihono:** But, we wouldn't have come up with this design, would we\? And I really like the look of this\!  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan--  
**Mihono:** When you were thinking about how to do the outfits, your face was all bright and cheery\.  
**Mihono:** You've been doing so many things you weren't used to lately, so I think it must've been tough on you, but it's like you forgot all about that now\.  
**Mihono:** See, Kiyoka\. Even if you mess up a little when you're singing or dancing, as long as you can have fun with us like you were now, it's all okay\!  
**Mihono:** I think doing that would be a lot more like your usual self\.  
**Kiyoka:** Having fun, with all of you\.\.\. Ah\!  
**Mihono:** What's wrong\?  
**Kiyoka:** Well\.\.\. Once before, I was part of a maid cafe\.  
**Kiyoka:** And I just remembered, back then too, when I had fun, it turned out really successful\.  
**Mihono:** See what I mean\! So, we should all do this together\!  
**Mihono:** You're really charming when you're having fun\! We all like you when you're staying just like that\!  
**Kiyoka:** Thank you, Hono-chan\.\.\. for telling that to me\.  
**Kiyoka:** I'll keep on trying\. I'll try my best with everyone\!  
Kiyoka's design arrangements were incorporated into the outfits with the Five Traditions' approval-- and were officially provided for each member\.

  
And then, the day of their debut live came\.

  
**Tsugumi:** There sure are a lot of visitors gathered\.  
**Yui:** Are you doing alright, Kiyoka-chan\?  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah\.\.\. I'm feeling very nervous, but I'm fine\.  
**Kiyoka:** I want to have fun together with everyone\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** That's the spirit, Kiyoka\! Alright, let's go\!  
**Mihono:** Hello, and nice to meet you-\!  
**Mihono:** Thank you all for coming today-\! We'll sing the best we can, so please listen\!  
**Kiyoka:** A-Ah\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka, let's sing into the same mic together\! Here\~\!  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan\.\.\. Okay\!  
**Kofuki:** Gimme some room, Kiyoka\. The crowd totally eats up ad-libbing like this\!  
**Yui:** Ahh\! No fair, squeezing your way in-\! Let me in there too-\!  
**Kiyoka:** Fwahh\.\.\. Y-You're too, too close\.\.\.\!  
With the help of the other members, their debut live managed to be a hit\.

  
**Mihono:** Great work, guys-\! Thanks for giving it your all\!  
**Mirja:** The audience was very excited as well\. If we continue with this practice, I think we'll be able to put on an even better performance at the main stage\.  
**Mihono:** All we've gotta do for the cultural festival is keep on practicing, right\! \.\.\.Wait, hang on\?  
**Mihono:** I got a text on my phone\.\.\. H-Huhhh\!\?  
**Chie:** What is it, Mihono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\.\.\. See, it's not just us who's going to be idols at the cultural festival\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Kanami and the members of the elite guard have started doing it too\.\.\.\!  

## 4: We're All Doing a Review Session\!
The next day--

  
**Mihono:** I'll say it again, we all did great yesterday\! Our debut live was a whole lot of fun\!  
**Mihono:** And so, this might feel a little soon, but I thought we could do a review session of our first live performance\. Let's all bring up stuff we noticed\!  
**Chie:** Well then, I think we pulled it off very well\. We might not be used to acting as idols, but we all managed to keep singing properly until the end\.  
**Kofuki:** And my ad-libbing got the crowd way into it\! Going up and shouting in front of a bunch of people honestly felt pretty good\.  
**Yui:** I'm feeling extra satisfied too, after getting to different sides of you all than usual\! I got to press up real tight against Kiyoka-chan while we were singing too\!  
**Kiyoka:** That was sort of embarrassing\.\.\. But, I think it was also a little reassuring\.  
**Mirja:** It's certainly good that we were able to conclude our live performance without any issues\. I'm in agreement\. With our current skill level, there was likely a chance we could have embarrased ourselves\.  
**Mirja:** Next, let's investigate what things we did wrong\.  
**Tsugumi:** In that case, I have some to start with\.  
**Kofuki:** What, you got something to complain about\.\.\.\?  
**Tsugumi:** They're not from me\. I meant from the audience\.  
**Tsugumi:** I had them fill out a survey after the show, and there were several comments that read: \"Disappointing,\" \"Go practice more,\" \"I honestly expected too much\"\.\.  
**Mirja:** Then, that means we should strive to improve the quality of our performance\.  
**Kofuki:** What'd they even think was so bad\? There wasn't really anything we need to fix\.  
**Mirja:** That's not true\. For both our dancing and our singing, our skills are still underdeveloped\.  
**Mirja:** Etou Kanami and the elite guard have also begun working on stage for the cultural festival\. In other words, we need to compete against them to win\.  
**Kiyoka:** In that case, we can't be satisfied just because we can manage this\.\.\. That's what you mean, right\?  
**Tsugumi:** One solution is to continue our practice daily\. Though, I'm unsure if that alone will be enough to win over the audience\.  
**Yui:** Win over the audience, huh\.\.\. If we could do that, we'd already be like pros\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, maybe we could do more ad-libbing, to make it feel more like a live performance\?  
**Chie:** But there's also a chance of us messing up with those, so I don't think it's a good idea to do it too much\.  
**Kofuki:** Who needs a plan or whatever\. Keeping up with it's way too annoying\.  
**Mihono:** (I had a lot of fun at yesterday's show, and I thought we put in a really good effort\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** (I guess we really do still have a long ways to go\.\.\.\)  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan, you in here\?  
**Kanami:** Wait, you're having a meeting\!\? Sorry\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** What'd you need, Kanami\?  
**Chie:** It's alright, come on in\.  
**Kanami:** Thanks\. Then, I'll only take a minute\.  
**Kanami:** Actually, yesterday, I saw your live performance\.  
**Kanami:** And, since it put me in a good mood, I thought I'd come and thank you guys\.  
**Mihono:** I-It did\?  
**Kanami:** Yeah\. You were all shining up on stage, and I thought you looked incredible\.  
**Mihono:** Thanks, Kanami\. I'm glad we could help somebody out\.  
**Kanami:** I didn't say that much\.\.\. Did something happen\?  
**Mihono:** Well, kind of\.\.\. See, it doesn't seem like the audience's reactions were all that great\.  
**Kanami:** That's not true at all\! All the people around me were smiling\!  
**Kanami:** We're normally protecting the people by cutting down aradama with okatana, but\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** I thought, it's amazing we can help them smile in a different kind of way too\!  
**Mihono:** You were thinking that, Kanami\.\.\.\? That sorta makes me feel better\.  
**Mihono:** But, when you say all that\.\.\. It makes me want to go see your performance too\.  
**Kanami:** You want to see our performance\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\. I'm just picturing how shiny you guys must look up on stage\.  
**Mihono:** I bet you'd look pretty amazing\.  
**Kanami:** Nnn\~\.\.\. Then, how about we do a live show together next time\?  
**Kanami:** We might be rivals in the main performance, but I want you to see us on stage too\!  
**Mihono:** A show together\.\.\. Yeah, that sounds good\!  
**Mihono:** Maybe we're on different teams, but we still feel the same about wanting to make people smile\. Let's both try our hardest and make this show the best\!  
**Kofuki:** Now we're doing something annoying again\. Gimme a break\. I mean, are you guys really up for this\?  
**Chie:** Of course I'm fine with it\. We should train lots for this joint-live\.  
**Yui:** I can't think of anything better than getting even more pretty girls up on stage\!  
**Kiyoka:** You never change, do you, Yui-chan\.  
**Mihono:** Okaaay, let's do our best for the joint-live-\!  
**Everyone:** Yeah-\!\!  

## 5: An Idol's Special Move\?
**Mihono:** Alright, match your steps to mine-\!  
**Mihono:** If you're even a little off, it'll definitely stand out, so we've gotta focus\!  
**Kiyoka:** O-Okay-\!  
**Tsugumi:** This is some fairly hard choreography, isn't it\.  
**Mihono:** You're doing good, we're getting the motions right\! Okay, now for the last set\!  
**Mihono:** Alright, that's it for today's lesson\! Great work-\!  
**Yui:** Nice job\~\. Phew, it's really starting to feel like we're in special training mode here\.  
**Mirja:** We can't show Etou Kanami and the others a poor performance\. It's not unreasonable that the practice would become harder\.  
**Mihono:** That's right, we've gotta practice a lot so we can get even better\!  
**Mihono:** But, I was thinking, it'd be nice if we had some kind of \"ace up our sleeve\" that'd boost up our performance\.  
**Chie:** An ace up our sleeve\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\. Like, a special move or something\.  
**Kofuki:** Do idols even do stuff like special moves\?  
**Mihono:** W-Well, I don't know\.\. But, if we don't do \"something\", I feel like we won't win over the audience\.  
**Kiyoka:** Like a finishing pose\?  
**Yui:** Or if we take off enough clothes so that it's just risky enough, and hit them with sex appeal\.  
**Mirja:** Stop that right there, Yamashiro Yui\.  
**Kofuki:** Ugh, this is all so dumb\. I'm not putting up with any more of this\.  
**Kofuki:** Oi\! Get some aradama-chan for me\. I need to blow off stress\!  
**Tsugumi:** I suppose you can't help it\.  
**Kiyoka:** Those two left\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\.\.\. But, it's not like Fukki's wrong, since we don't even know if we can come up with an \"ace up our sleeve\"\.  
**Mihono:** Though, if we just keep going like this and don't make it in time for the cultural festival\.\.\. Nngh\~\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** (Maybe we just aren't cut out to be idols after all\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** (No\.\.\. That can't be right\!\)  
**Mihono:** (Kanami said watching our performance made her feel better\. There's got to be some way for us to make people smile\!\)  
When the next day's lessons were starting\.

  
**Kiyoka:** Kofuki-san\.\.\. She didn't come today\.  
**Chie:** Mm, that's worrisome\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Since last time, I've been trying to think of a performance that'll make Fukki want to do it, but I can't really come up with anything\.  
**Mirja:** If there were a dance closely related to the suppression of aradama, I'm sure Shichinosato Kofuki would feel motivated\.  
**Mihono:** Nnn, but, is there one\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ah-\!  
**Mihono:** Hey, everybody\! I just thought this up, but--  
**Mihono:** What if, when we were dancing on stage, we used some toji techniques\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Used them\.\.\. Like, how exactly\?  
**Mihono:** Like, if we used jin'i to move really fast\!  
**Mirja:** I see\. A dance applying toji powers would certainly draw attention\.  
**Tsugumi:** If that's what you're after, then let's use the data I've been accumulating\.  
**Tsugumi:** If we can make use of combat formations in a dance and refine them, aradama suppression should go more smoothly in the future\.  
**Mirja:** However, it sounds very difficult to manage\.  
**Mihono:** But still, I'm sure we can find a way to make it work\!  
**Mihono:** Alright\! With this, we can win over Fukki\!  
**Kofuki:** Huh\? You're using jin'i in a dance\? So what\?  
**Mihono:** We're basing it off the combat data Tsugumi-san has, so the better our dance gets, the better we should be able to beat aradama from now on\!  
**Mihono:** I think it'll be great for you too, Fukki, but what do you think\!  
**Kofuki:** Beat aradama by dancing\.\.\. Ahahaha\! What the hell\! That's way too funny, Mihocchi\.  
**Kofuki:** Fine, I'll go be part of this special training of yours\!  
**Mihono:** Ah\.\.\. Thanks, Fukki\!  
**Kofuki:** Still, you must've thought pretty hard about all this just to win me over\.  
**Mihono:** That's cause I want to be idols with you\!  
**Mihono:** Alright, let's get back to everyone fast and try this out\!  
**Mihono:** Ready; here we go\.  
**Mihono:** Focus your mind, and\.\.\. Uwahh\!\?  
**Chie:** Are you alright, Mihono-chan\!\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\.\.\. I should've known, dancing this part while holding onto an okatana is tough when you're not used to it\.  
**Mihono:** But, I'll keep trying\.\.\. Where there's a will, there's a way\!  
**Mihono:** If we can match the timing of our dancing, this'll\.\.\.\!  
**Kofuki:** Oi oi, don't go pushing it too hard, Mihocchi\.  
**Mihono:** I'm fine, Fukki\.\.\. I want to master this dance, whatever it takes\.  
**Mihono:** That way, I can put smiles on the faces of everyone who comes to see us\.\.\.\!  

## 6: Kanami and Mihono's Joint-Live
And so the day of Mihono and Kanami's teams' joint-live arrived\.

  
**Yui:** Ooh, there's a whole lot of people here\!  
**Kiyoka:** I-It's making me nervous\~\.  
**Mihono:** I'm counting on you today, Kanami\.  
**Kanami:** I'm counting on you too, Mihono-chan\. Let's both make this a great live show\!  
**Hiyori:** It's time to show the results of all the practice we've been doing\. Let's give it our all, everyone\.  
**Sanae:** You sure are motivated, Juujou-san\. I sort of wasn't expecting that from you\.  
**Hiyori:** I'm not motivated, this is just our mission to do this\.  
**Mai:** We'll have to do our best too, Sayaka-chan\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm\. I'm excited to be on stage with you, Mai\.  
**Kaoru:** Since there's this many people here, isn't it fine for me to head back home-\?  
**Ellen:** Yeah, yeah, we're already starting, Kaoru\. Our team's up first, so here we go\!  
**Kanami:** Everybody-\! Thank you all for coming today-\!  
**Kanami:** I hope you'll enjoy our performance\!  
**Kiyoka:** Wow\.\.\. They're incredible\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** Both them and the audience look like they're having a lot of fun\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Ah, did they slip up a little just now\? Where their dance came together\.  
**Chie:** Their singing too, there's times when their pitch is off\. Though\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\. Just watching them, it's like my heart is dancing\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** You did great, Kanami\! It was really really good\!  
**Kanami:** Thanks\! You're up next, Mihono-chan\!  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono, about the dance involving jin'i, what should we do\?  
**Mirja:** In practice, we were never able to maintain the dance until the end\. As our leader, I leave it to you whether or not we use it in our performance\.  
**Mihono:** Hmm\.\.\. Nnnn\~\.\.\.\!  
**Kofuki:** Oi, we're up already\!  
**Mihono:** Nnn\~\~, this time, we'll dance without using jin'i\!  
**Mihono:** We can't bring down the whole joint-live if we screw it up\.  
**Yui:** Got it-\! That makes us on even terms with Kanami and them\.  
**Kiyoka:** L-Let's do the best we can, Hono-chan-\!  
Mihono-chan and the others headed out before the audience, and their performance began\.

  
**Mihono:** (Huh\.\.\.\?\)  
**Chie:** (We are making mistakes, but\.\.\. Hasn't our dancing improved since our first live\.\.\.\?\)  
**Kiyoka:** (Maybe this is because\.\.\. of what we learned practicing dancing using jin'i\.\)  
**Kofuki:** (Haha, my body's moving really good\. This'll work\.\)  
**Yui:** (Rather than just dancing like we usually do\.\.\.\)  
**Mirja:** (As you'd expect from applying our combat data to our choreography, these movements are now optimized for us\.\)  
**Tsugumi:** (If it could give off this much of a different impression, it was well worth providing the data\.\)  
**Mihono:** (All our breathing is in sync too\! Okaaay\.\.\.\!\)  
**Kanami:** Ah, Mihono-chan and everybody are back\. Nice work-\!  
**Mihono:** Thanks, Kanami\! But\.\.\. The audience seemed a little more into it when you guys were up there\.  
**Kanami:** That's not true at all\! They were just as excited to see you\!  
**Mihono:** Nah, that's not it\. You could tell right away just how much practice you guys have done\.  
**Mihono:** Compared to that\.\.\. We've actually been practicing for a special move\.  
**Kanami:** Special move\!\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, a jin'i dance\! Though\.\.\. it didn't work out in the end\.  
**Mihono:** But, if you dance together with the people you're really close with and reach out to each other, you'll definitely end up in perfect sync\.  
**Mihono:** We kinda took the long way getting here, but I finally get it\.  
**Mirja:** Compared to our previous live show, I believe we're showing steady improvement\. There's no need to push ourselves\.  
**Yui:** Alright, let's keep giving it our best from here-\!  
**Kiyoka:** Huh\.\.\. Doesn't it look like people are gathering over that way for some reason\?  
**Kofuki:** It's the weekend and all, so there's probably something exciting going on\.  
**Mihono:** I wonder what\.\.\. We should go check it out too\.  

## 7: After Hanging Our Heads
**Mihono:** You think they're doing some kind of event over here too\?  
**Mirja:** It seems they will soon be conducting a band contest\. There was a poster over there\.  
**Kanami:** You didn't know, Mihono-chan\? This is\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Stop, Kanamin\! They'll know in a minute, so it'll be more fun if we don't say anything\!  
**Mirja:** What do you mean by that\?  
**Ellen:** I'm sure this'll be a good surprise\~\.  
**Kiyoka:** What do you think they're up to, Hono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** Hmm\~\.\.\. Maybe Kanami's team's going to keep their live show going over here\?  
**Kofuki:** That's all you can come up with\!\? The poster said it's a band event\!  
**Yume:** Huh-\? What're you onee-sans here for\?  
**Mihono:** Eh\.\.\. Y-Yume-san\?  
**Suzuka:** Well now, all of you are here as well\. It's good to see you\.  
**Suzuka:** Have you already finished with your live show\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, just a few minutes ago\. And then, there was a big commotion over here, so\.\.\.  
**Maki:** I see; you came at the right time\. I wanted you to be here to see our music performance\.  
**Mihono:** Music performance\?  
**Maki:** We didn't tell you, but\.\.\. We've been preparing something a little different\.  
**Mihono:** Wait, does that mean\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Yes, we've formed a band\. We'll be participating in this live show here\.  
**Yume:** We wanted to test our skills-\. And, of course, we aren't planning on losing either\!  
**Mihono:** Eh\.\.\. EHHHHHHHHHHHH\~\!\? The elite guard formed a band\!\?  
**Student 1:** Hey, did you go see the elite guard's band live yesterday\?  
**Student 2:** Of course I did\! It was just incredible\!  
**Student 3:** They were all so skilled on their instruments that my ears were melting\.\.\.  
**Student 4:** We'll have to go support them when the cultural festival comes too\!  
**Mihono:** Wherever you go, everybody's talking about yesterday's band live, aren't they\.  
**Mihono:** But we tried our hardest doing our own live too, y'know\.  
**Kofuki:** You tell 'em, Mihocchi\! Can't believe they went out of their way to do their live right after ours\!  
**Chie:** Their performance was impressive\.\.\. So there's nothing we can do about it\. The four of them were completely in tune with each other\.  
**Mirja:** Having both true talent and existing popularity, it's only natural they would overshadow us\.  
**Mihono:** Reality is cruel\.\.\.  
**Yui:** C'mon and cheer up, Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** Yui\.\.\.\!  
**Yui:** The elite guard's band was seriously the best\! There's no way anybody wouldn't love it\!  
**Kofuki:** Oi, we've got an enemy among us\.  
**Mihono:** Because of Yui, I'm feeling even worse now\.  
**Kiyoka:** B-But, don't you think that, we shouldn't need to worry about it that much\?  
**Mirja:** It would be more appropriate to say that worrying about it won't do us any good\.  
**Mihono:** I get that and all, but\.\.\. Sorry\!   
**Mihono:** I'm gonna go take a walk to clear my head a little\!  
**Mihono:** Sigh, even though I know we've gotta be working hard now\.\.\. It sort of just feels like I can't focus on anything\.  
**Maki:** Asakura Mihono\? Weren't you doing practice\?  
**Mihono:** Shidou-san\.\.\. and the rest of the elite guard too\.  
**Yume:** Don't tell me, you're taking the day off\? You onee-sans suck enough already, so you're not gonna make it if you don't practice a bunch-\.  
**Mihono:** Ugh\.\.\. I was, just\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah, your performance yesterday was really great\!  
**Mihono:** Everybody in the audience got totally wrapped up in your music\!  
**Yume:** Heheh, course they were\. Cause, it's our band and all\. We signed up at the last second, but it was really fun\!  
**Suzuka:** It was a challenge keeping within their restrictions though\. Really now, if only a certain someone wouldn't make such hasty decisions\.\.\.  
**Maki:** Ugh, sorry about that\.  
**Maki:** But, look at how hard our kouhai are working to liven up the cultural festival\.  
**Mihono:** Huh\.\.\.\?  
**Maki:** You're staying back late every day to practice, aren't you\? When I saw that, I decided to put us in the contest\.  
**Mihono:** You were watching us, Shidou-san\.\.\.\?  
**Maki:** We're all toji\. We have our missions, and we need to train ourselves to see them through\.  
**Maki:** If I'm being honest\.\.\. I used to be against this assignment too\. But, that's not the case anymore\.  
**Maki:** There isn't a lot of time before the main event, Asakura Mihono\. Let's both of us aim to make it the ultimate show\.  
**Mihono:** Okay\.\.\. Thanks a lot\!  
**Mihono:** (What was I getting so down in the dumps over\.\.\. If I want to beat somebody tough, all I have to do is train harder than ever\.\)  
**Mihono:** (Alright\~, I'm gonna head back to school now and work even harder-\!\)  

## 8: In Order to Surpass the Best
**Kanami:** What's up, Mihono-chan\? You're in a real hurry\.  
**Mihono:** Ah, Kanami\! Actually, right now, we're\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Wait, I know\! You should come be in the meeting too, Kanami\!  
**Kanami:** Meeting\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, our meeting\!  
**Mihono:** Ah, but I guess it's no good with just you going\. You should ask Mai and everyone to come\!  
**Kanami:** That's fine, but, what's it about\.\.\. And she's already gone\. What kind of meeting are we having\?  
**Kanami:** So anyway, Mihono-chan\. What's this meeting about\?  
**Mihono:** I want us to think together about how we can make the ultimate live show\!  
**Mihono:** Actually, to tell the truth, I just came up with it\!  
**Kofuki:** When you say \"just came up with it\"\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** This meeting has started off an awful lot like Hono-chan\.  
**Tsugumi:** That's right, we'll be aiming to make use of the jin'i dance, won't we\. And you called Etou-san and the others here to gather fresh data\.  
**Sanae:** A jin'i dance does sound kind of fun\. Don't you think Juujou-san could be able to make it work\?  
**Hiyori:** Y-You think so\?  
**Mihono:** We're not doing the jin'i dance, okay\!\?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Umm, I think everybody here heard the elite guard's music performance, but it was pretty great, wasn't it\?  
**Mihono:** All of us want to make the show a success, and have everybody clapping and smiling for us, and everybody talking about us the next day at school, right\!\!  
**Mai:** That would be great, but\.\.\. How are we going to go about doing that\?  
**Mihono:** Let's hold a training camp\! All our group and Kanami's group too\!  
**Ellen:** A joint-training camp\.\.\. That's not a bad idea\. If we do lessons together and help build each other up, I'm sure we'll get our skills to an even higher level\!  
**Mihono:** Right\?  
**Mihono:** There's no time left before the main event\. But still, we've gotta improve some more if we're going to be ready\.  
**Mihono:** Which means\.\.\. We've gotta do everything we can\!  
**Chie:** You always get like this\.\.\. You decide things on your own without explaining anything, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** Sorry about that, Chii-nee\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.It's fine\. So long as you're feeling better, I'm happy with whatever you decide\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Sigh\. This sounds like too much work, but I'm not gonna be able to get out of this, am I\?  
**Sanae:** I think I'm up for it too\. And I'd like to ask more about your jin'i dance when we have a break\.  
**Sanae:** Juujou-san, do you want to try it with me\?  
**Hiyori:** Well, why not\. There's no harm in trying\.  
**Mihono:** Shidou-san told me they're gonna make it the ultimate show\. So then\.\.\. we should all make it even better than ultimate\!  
**Kanami:** Better than ultimate\.\.\. Sure\! For some reason, that gets me really pumped up\!  
**Kanami:** Let's all train together until we get so good that even the elite guard can't believe it\!  
On the first day of the training camp--

  
**Ellen:** Okay, attention, everyone\! Please try matching my actions\!  
**Ellen:** Wave your hands even wider\.\.\. Good\! With that, let's take a rest\.  
**Yui:** Phwahh\~\. That lesson was pretty hard\.  
**Chie:** It really is a big help having Ellen-san as our dance coach\.  
**Ellen:** You're all so serious about this, so I feel even more energized than usual\! Let's both support and teach each other new things\!  
**Kofuki:** Aghh, I'm beat\. What about you, Mihocchi\? You feeling it\?  
**Mihono:** Mmm, I feel like, if we do lessons with Kanami and them, we'll definitely level ourselves up\.  
**Mihono:** But I know for sure Shidou-san and them are out practicing too\.\.\. It makes me a little nervous\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** They won't be such easy opponents to catch up with, after all\.  
**Tsugumi:** As we improve here, they'll be improving too\.\.\. It's a nice, stimulating relationship\.  
**Mirja:** There's no reason to panic\. This is our only course of action right now, so we should simply steadily push on\.  
**Mihono:** Alright\!   
**Tsugumi:** I've just recieved a message\. It seems like there's been an aradama outbreak nearby\.  
**Kanami:** We're sortieing then\. Let's all go\! We have to beat the aradama quick, so we can get back to our lessons\!  

## 9: The Center's Decided\!
**Mihono:** --HAAHH\!\!  
**Mihono:** Kanami, cover my back for me\!  
**Kanami:** Leave it to me\!  
**Mihono:** They're coming from that way too; watch out\!  
**Kanami:** Okay-\! Back me up, Mihono-chan\!  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono and Etou Kanami form a fairly advanced combination, don't they\.  
**Kaoru:** They haven't even been doing this for that long, but they're totally in sync\.  
**Mihono:** (It's kinda weird\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** (With both of us leaving our backs to each other like this, it's like I can tell right away what kind of moves Kanami wants to make next\.\)  
**Kanami:** Nice assist, Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** You're\.\.\. welcome-\!  
**Mihono:** (If I could work this smoothly with Kanami, while we're on the same idol team together\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** (I bet we could put on an even nicer performance\.\)  
**Mihono:** (----\.\.\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** Wow\.\.\. Hono-chan and Kanami-chan are amazing together\.\.\.  
**Chie:** I know\. Even though they're fighting, they move so beautifully\.\.\. I can't take my eyes off them\.  
**Hiyori:** It's like the two of them are dancing with each other\.  
**Kanami:** This should be--  
**Mihono:** The end of them-\!\!  
**Tsugumi:**  --Good work, everyone\. Leave the cleanup work to me\.  
**Kanami:** Phew\.\.\. Mihono-chan, thanks for back there\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I know\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** Let's do it together, Kanami\! Let's be idols together\!  
**Kanami:** You mean\.\.\. You want us all to go up on stage together\?  
**Mihono:** If we all form one big idol group, I'm sure we can make it the ultimate show\!  
**Kiyoka:** H-Hold on, Hono-chan\. We can't just decide that all of a sudden\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Wouldn't it be hard for us all to coordinate\?  
**Mihono:** Where there's a will, there's a way\!  
**Mihono:** And besides, it's not like this is coming from nowhere\. We're already seeing the training we did together pay off\.  
**Mihono:** You can tell from the mission we just did\! We knew just what to do with each other, right\?  
**Kanami:** You're not wrong\.\.\. When we were fighting now, I felt like I could naturally tell everything Mihono-chan was going to do next\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** If we could take that feeling up on stage at the cultural festival\.\.\. We could make it the ultimate show\!  
**Ellen:** Dancing with a big group sounds like fun\! I think it's a nice idea\!  
**Kaoru:** It's not like we've got anything to lose\. I don't care either way\.  
**Mai:** I'm excited to see what the stage will look like if we go out there with Mihono-chan and everyone\.  
**Sayaka:** If Mai wants to do it, I do too\.  
**Yui:** All of a sudden we've doubled up the cuties\. You know I'm all for it\!  
**Mirja:** It seems that we've already settled on this\.  
**Mirja:** At the same time, it appears we've also found our new team's center\.  
**Chie:** That's true\. Between all the girls here, I think Mihono-chan and Etou-san have the best coordination\.  
**Chie:** Though, everyone else was working together much better during the fight just now\.\.\.  
**Chie:** But I think you two should be our center during the cultural festival\.  
**Mihono:** Eh\!\? Y\.\.\. You're fine with that\?  
**Chie:** Of course I am, but you wanted to do it yourself, didn't you, Mihono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** I did, but, I thought for sure we'd do auditions or something to decide the center\.  
**Kofuki:** It's not like anybody's against going with Mihocchi\. I'd actually be annoyed if it came around to me\.  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, when you were fighting just now\.\.\. You already looked like idols, it was so amazing\!  
**Mirja:** We'll all support you two as best as we can\.  
**Mihono:** Kanami and me as a double-center\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Let's give it our best shot, Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah-\! Thanks, everybody\!  
After the training camp was over, Mihono went straight to report to Maki\.

  
**Maki:** Okay\.\.\. So you and Etou Kanami's teams will be performing together\.  
**Maki:** The main performance'll be something to see\.  
**Mihono:** You can count on us\! We'll put on the ultimate performance, so good it'll make you and the elite guard smile too\!  
**Maki:** Us too\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\!  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Good then\.  
**Maki:** The cultural festival is almost here\. I'm looking forward to standing up on the same stage as you\.  

## 10: The Unified Cultural Festival Starts\!
And so the day of the cultural festival came--

  
**Kanami:** Wow\~\.\.\. There's just so many stalls and attractions set up\!  
**Mihono:** I know\! Everything's so lively that I'm having fun just looking around\.  
**Kanami:** I'm glad we had a bit of spare time here-\. Otherwise I wouldn't have gotten to tour around with you, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** We went in that haunted house, and we had yakisoba from that stand together\.  
**Mihono:** And after this\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Are you thinking about how we have to go on stage, Mihono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\. It's like I can't help but keep coming back to it\.  
**Mihono:** Who'd have thought we'd be getting up on stage together, Kanami\?  
**Kanami:** It's pretty exciting, huh Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** It's exciting, but I'm nervous too\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Hey, Kanami\. You think the guest'll be happy with our performance\?  
**Kanami:** We tried our hardest, so I'm sure we'll do fine\.  
**Kanami:** And, you know, where there's a will, there's a way\.\.\. right\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\.\.\. That's right\!  
**Chie:** Ah, Mihono-chan\. Over here\.  
**Mirja:** They asked for the performers to wait here until it's their turn on stage\.  
**Student Host:** Err, now then, the stage event for the Five Traditions Unified Cultural Festival will start from here\!  
**Student Host:** Opening the show will be everyone from the elite guard\!  
**Mihono:** Th-Those cheers are crazy\.\.\.\!  
**Maki:** Thanks for coming to see us, everybody\.  
**Suzuka:** I hope you'll all enjoy the show till the end\.  
**Yomi:** Is everything ready\?  
**Yume:** Then, let's get going-\! One, two\.\.\.\!  
**Yui:** They've started, but, this is\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Did they bump up the quality even more since last time we heard them\?  
**Kiyoka:** Tsubakuro-san's singing voice is so pretty\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Konohana Suzuka's guitar finds the melody, and Satsuki Yomi's bass guitar sets the tempo\.  
**Mirja:** Finally, Shidou Maki's drumming supports them all\.  
**Hiyori:** They must have practiced seriously for this\.  
**Kanami:** Yeah, and when they're so busy usually\. That's incredible\.  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, these guitars are rather passionate and exciting to play\.  
**Suzuka:** You seem to be striking a steady chord with your bass as well, Yomi-san\?  
**Yomi:** Yes, just as we practiced\.  
**Maki:** I'll push up everybody's performance from behind\. Go ahead and let it all out\.  
**Yume:** Thanks, Maki-onee-san\! C'mon, lets get things even more rocking here-\!  
**Kanami:** They put on a great show, didn't they, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah-- But, I'm not gonna let it get to me anymore\.  
**Mihono:** We'll win over the audience when we put on our ultimate performance\!  
**Kaoru:** Our turn's almost up-; you ready to go\?  
**Ellen:** It feels like the music from their performance is still echoing on stage though\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** That's just what we want\! Let's go, everybody\!  
**Academy Announcement:** We have confirmed the appearance of aradama in the area of this academy\. All toji are to prepare for immediate sortie\. I repeat\. We have confirmed the appearance of aradama--  
**Mai:** Oh no\.\.\. We were just about to go up on stage too\.\.\.\!  

## 11: What We Protect
**Suzuka:** For aradama to appear with this many people gathered together; the timing couldn't be worse\.  
**Maki:** They're not going to give us a choice\. Our circumstances don't mean a thing to them\.  
**Yomi:** Their numbers seem to be in the hundreds, and large-scale aradama have been confirmed\.  
**Yume:** That's a whole bunch-\! Though, I'll get all of them myself anyway\!  
**Maki:** Suzuka, Yomi, and I will guide the civilians to safety\. All remaining toji, suppress the aradama\! Move out\!  
**Yui:** So does this mean the stage show's getting cancelled in the end\?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.For now, we should eliminate the aradama as quickly as possible\.  
**Kanami:** Let's go, Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah\!  
**Kofuki:** Phew\.\.\. Man, that was a hunt\.  
**Kiyoka:** It doesn't seem like any of the civilians were hurt, so that's good\~\.  
**Sanae:** I wonder if any aradama are left\. With this many of us here, it was over in a flash\.  
**Hiyori:** That's for sure\. Though\.\.\. Was it because we're all prepared for the show\? Everyone's movements were sharper than usual\.  
**Ellen:** Leave it to Hiyoyon to notice something like that\! Actually, these clothes that we're wearing were designed by Grandpa\!  
**Kaoru:** Weird-\. So even the old man got involved\?  
**Ellen:** \"You might have to end up fighting while wearing these\.\.\. Alright, I'll see a little of what I can do,\" said Grandpa, and he got a spark in his eyes\!  
**Hiyori:** So, what does that mean for us\?  
**Ellen:** With some tamahagane used in some decorations, when used together with an okatana\.\.\. Would you believe it\! Some of your powers get a boost\!  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.Or there's a chance that could happen\!  
**Kaoru:** What is this, another test operation\? Does he think we're guinea pigs\?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Either way, it's true that these uniforms helped us out\. They seem like they'll let us show some extra effort during the show too\.  
**Academy Announcement:** In regards to the stage event that was to be held at this academy, we are currently discussing whether it will be re-opened\. Please wait a moment--  
**Tsugumi:** There's a good chance the stage show will be cancelled, isn't there\.  
**Kaoru:** Aradama were rampaging around just a couple minutes ago\. They can't come to a decision that easy\.  
**Mihono:** I know there's nothing we can do about it, but still\.\.\. I don't want it to get cancelled\.  
**Mihono:** We went through all that practicing, so I want everybody to see\.  
**Sanae:** Isn't it kind of noisy over that way\?  
**Chie:** What could be going on\? Let's go see where the voices are coming from, Mihono-chan\.  
**Spectator 1:** Ah, there's the girls from before\!  
**Mihono:** Eh\?  
**Spectator 1:** Thank you so much for saving us\! Thanks to you, my daughter and I were able to get to safety\!  
**Spectator 2:** You girls are doing the stage show too, aren't you\? I've been looking forward to it\!  
**Spectator 3:** I went to see their live show in town once before, and it was really good\!  
**Spectator 4:** Do your best out there-\!  
**Mihono:** Everybody\.\.\.  
**Maki:** It sounds like lots of people have seen just how much effort you've put into this\.  
**Academy Announcement:** We have an announcement to make\. After discussing it, we have now decided to resume the stage show\.  
**Academy Announcement:** We hope you continue to enjoy the Five Traditions Unified Cultural Festival--  
**Mihono:** W-We're doing it\.\.\. We get to go up on stage\.\.\.\!  
**Maki:** Go and show everything you've accomplished with your training\.  
**Mihono:** We will\! We'll put on the ultimate show for you, so please watch us\!  

## 12: The Ultimate Show\!
**Chie:** There's only a few minutes before we go up on stage\.  
**Yui:** Ahhh\~, I'm so glad the show didn't get cancelled\!  
**Yui:** After all the practicing we did, it'd be way too sad if it ended like that\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah\.\.\. Thinking about how we're about to go out there, I'm sort of getting butterflies in my stomach\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** It'll be fine, Kiyoka\. We can do this\.  
**Kofuki:** We got through all those annoying lessons\. There's no way we'll mess this up\.  
**Mirja:** There's no doubt that we should have the talent for it\.  
**Chie:** All that's left is for us to go up on stage and give the best performance we can\.  
**Yui:** Just be cute, have fun, and sing\!  
**Tsugumi:** It's nearly time for us to go\.  
**Kanami:** Let's go, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** Kanami\.\.\. Yeah\! Let's make this the ultimate show together\!  
**Mihono:** Thank you all of you for coming to see us; I mean it-\!  
**Mihono:** When you came to the festival and said you wanted to see our show\.\.\. It made me suuu\~per happy\!  
**Mihono:** We've been working to put on the kind of show that'll cheer up anyone who hears it\.\.\. That, even if something sad happened, it'll clear it all away\.  
**Mihono:** We're gonna sing the best we can, to make all of you smile\!  
**Kaoru:** Ohh, those're some good cheers-\.  
**Ellen:** We can't let the audience beat us\! Let's get even more excited than that\!  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, I'll follow your lead, so move however you want\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm, thanks, Mai\.  
**Hiyori:** Alright, next it's our turn to show off\.  
**Sanae:** Mmhm, let's give it our best shot, Juujou-san\!  
**Mihono:** Nnn\~\~\~, I never knew it felt this good being up on stage\!  
**Mihono:** Everybody, thank you so so much cheering us on this whole time\!  
**Mihono:** Okay, here comes the climax, Kanami\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah, let's stick together and give it one last burst\!  
**Mihono:** All my friends on stage with me, and everybody who supported us\.\.\. I love each and every one of you\!  
**Mihono:** Uhh, so anyway\.\.\. Good work, everybody\!  
**Everyone:** Good work-\!\!  
**Mihono:** Because of you guys, we made this the best festival ever\! So let's have fun at the afterparty too-\!  
**Mai:** That was a wonderful performance you gave, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** Eheheh, thanks, Mai\! It felt so good being out on stage too\!  
**Ellen:** I think we have what it takes to be idols\! Should we all debut together\?  
**Yui:** Would that get us up close and personal with real idols\!\?  
**Mirja:** When that time comes, we can leave Yamashiro Yui out of it\.  
**Yui:** You're so mean\~\.  
**Kiyoka:** Fufu\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.I was really nervous, but now that it's over, it was fun\.  
**Chie:** You tried harder than everyone, didn't you, Kiyoka-chan\.  
**Kiyoka:** I did everything I could so I wouldn't hold you all back\.  
**Kiyoka:** Did you have fun too, Chie-san\?  
**Chie:** Yes, of course I did\!  
**Kofuki:** Hey, this idol thing wasn't so bad\. I got to play with a bunch of aradama-chan too\.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, there's no connection between idols and aradama\.  
**Maki:** Sorry to interrupt you while you're enjoying yourselves\.  
**Kanami:** Shidou-san\! What brings you here\?  
**Maki:** We asked the visitors to vote on \"which group hyped up the stage the most\", and I came to share the results with you\.  
**Maki:** Congratulations, Asakura Mihono\. The award goes to your group\.  
**Mihono:** E-EHHHH\~\~\!\? Our group won\!\?  
**Mihono:** We did it\.\.\. We did it, Kanami\!\!  
**Mihono:** Getting to stand on stage together was so much fun\. Thanks so much for being there with me\!  
**Kanami:** I feel the same way, Mihono-chan\!  
**Yui:** That's crazy, that's crazy-\! I'm so glad we won\!\!  
**Chie:** I really am glad to hear it\! This just goes to show how many smiles we put on people's faces\!  
**Ellen:** There's no way we can't celebrate this, Chie\! Let's order an extra large cake to share\!  
**Kaoru:** You're gonna order one now\!\?  
**Mai:** Oh well, it is time to celebrate, isn't it\?  
**Kofuki:** Ugh\. Well, I guess it doesn't feel too bad\.  
**Sayaka:** You're not being honest, Kofuki\.  
**Tsugumi:** That's right\. You could show some more happiness\.  
**Kiyoka:** W-We had to go through a lot, but, I-I'm so glad\.\.\.\!  
**Sanae:** Ahh, there there, don't cry\.  
**Hiyori:** Here, take my handkerchief\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Thank you\!  
**Mirja:** This just means all your efforts have paid off\.  
**Maki:** And, with the results here, Asakura Mihono's team will periodically continue their activities as an idol group\.  
**Maki:** We'll be counting on you in the future\.  
**Yui:**　Ooh, that means I'll get to see everyone in their cute outfits again\! Nice-\!  
**Kiyoka:** I'm glad we got to make so many people happy, but, getting up on stage again\.\.\. I'm a little nervous about things will go\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Can I only go do it when there's aradama-chan around\?  
**Mirja:** I won't let you slack on your duties, Shichinosato Kofuki\.  
**Mirja:** Our lessons could also apply to suppressing aradama, so let's work hard at being idols again\.  
**Mihono:** You know, I had so much fun doing this festival today\!  
**Mihono:** So the next show, and the show after that, let's all work together to do our best\!
