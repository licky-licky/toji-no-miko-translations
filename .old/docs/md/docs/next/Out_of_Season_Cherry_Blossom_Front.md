**Out of Season Cherry Blossom Front:** Prologue  
**Kanami:** Hey, did all of you see? The flower buds on the cherry blossom trees behind the school are getting bigger\!  
**Hiyori:** I know\. I saw it myself earlier\. The weather report said the temperature should go up this weekend, and then they'll bloom\.  
**Mai:** We should go see them together after they start blooming\.  
**Sayaka:** Okay\. If Mai is going, I will too\.\.\.  
**Chie:** In that case, why don't we all organize a flower viewing party? I've been talking with Mihono-chan and the others about it\.  
**Kanami:** All of us going flower viewing\!? That sounds like fun\~\!  
**Hiyori:** That's true\.\.\. Going with a large group of people could be nice too\.  
**Chie:** I'm glad to hear it\. We'd have a hard time getting bentos ready for everyone, so we talked about buying what we liked from a nearby deli\. If there's anything you want to eat, just tell me, okay?  
**Mai:** Um, if it's alright, would you mind if I made everyone bento boxes? I'll come up with a menu to excite everyone when we're all seeing the flowers together\.  
**Hiyori:** If we're making a flower viewing bento, we'll have to include nimono\. I want to be in charge of helping make the food as well\.  
**Chie:** Oh my, that would be such a great help, you two\!  
**Sayaka:** Mai's homemade bento\.\.\. I can't wait\. I'll do my best to prepare too\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Yeah\. Let's work hard on the preparations together, Sayaka-chan\! Aside from the bento boxes, what do we need to get ready\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Well, we could use people in charge of reserving a good location, and people in charge of finding ways to liven up the party\.  
**Sayaka:** I understand\. I'll do my best\.\.\. To find a good location\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** And I'll help\!  
**Chie:** Then, I'll think something up with Ellen-san, Kiyoka-chan, and the others to liven up the event, and lend a hand to the girls making bento boxes on the side\.  
On the day of the flower viewing--

  
**Chie:** How are things going, you two? Is there anything I could help you with?  
**Mai:** All that's left is to fill the boxes, so we should be fine\.  
**Hiyori:** I tried cutting the carrots in the nimono into shapes to match the cherry blossoms\. Want to try some?  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Mai\.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, you came at just the right time\! We were just finishing up with the bento boxes\.  
**Mai:** Would you like to have a little taste test?  
**Sayaka:** I can't eat the bento\.  
**Mai:** Eh\!? Wh-What do you mean, Sayaka-chan\!? But, you were looking forward to it so much, weren't you\.\.\.?  
**Mai:** Did you get a stomachache\!?  
**Chie:** Calm down, Yanase-san\. Itomi-san, do you think you could tell me why you can't eat the bento?  
**Sayaka:** There's no cherry blossoms\.  
**Chie/Mai:** Eh?  
**Hiyori:** Well, there sure aren't any flowers\. Weren't they supposed to be in full bloom today?  
**Chie:** Itomi-san, I don't see Mihono-chan and the others anywhere\. Did they go to look for another location?  
**Sayaka:** Mm\. They said they wanted to eat the bento boxes where we could see the cherry blossoms\.  
**Mai:** I want to eat under the cherry blossoms with everyone too\!  
**Chie:** It would spoil the mood if there weren't any flowers, wouldn't it\. Maybe we should also\.\.\.  
**Aradama:** KEEEEEE\!  
**Hiyori:** An aradama\!? SEYAAAAH\!\!  
**Hiyori:** That's it taken care of\.  
**Sayaka:** Hm\.\.\.? Look\.\.\. The branch of that tree\.\.\.  
**Chie:** I don't believe it; the buds of the flowers are opening\!  
**Mai:** But why\!?  
**Tsugumi:** I see you're all here too\.  
**Tsugumi:** It appears that, when an aradama is suppressed, a grouping of cherry blossoms comes into bloom\.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm not sure of the reason behind it, but it is a highly fascinating phenomenon\.  
**Sayaka:** Tsugumi, that means\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** Our spring was stolen, by aradama?  
**Tsugumi:** Ooh\.\.\. Spring was stolen\.\.\.?  
**Mai:** Ah\! Sayaka-chan, that sounded so poetic\! What a lovely expression\!  
**Sayaka:** Is it wrong?  
**Tsugumi:** No\.\.\. There's nothing wrong with that interpretation of it\. The aradama went and stole our spring\!\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Then, for every aradama we defeat, it will bring back that many flowers?  
**Tsugumi:** That seems to be the case\.  
**Tsugumi:** But, well, to make the flowers bloom across this entire area could take some back-breaking work\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Still, let's do it\.  
**Mai:** Let's defeat the aradama, Chie-san\! Until all the flowers here are in bloom\!  
**Chie:** Of course\! I'll do what I can, so we can all have our flower viewing party\!  
**Hiyori:** Good, then let's defeat as many aradama as possible, and bring back our spring\!  
**Out of Season Cherry Blossom Front:** Epilogue  
**Sayaka:** Oh, Mai and everyone came\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan, Mai-chan, over here, over here\~\!  
**Mihono:** Hurry up, Chii-nee\~\!  
**Hiyori:** It's beautiful\.\.\. Everything is in full bloom\.  
**Mai:** Thank you for finding us such a fantastic place, Sayaka-chan, Kanami-chan\.  
**Kanami:** The other people who came to see the flowers offered us the best spot, to thank us for exorcising the aradama\.  
**Chie:** Did they really? It was worth going to so much trouble then\.  
**Mihono:** Ah\~, all that hard work suppressing aradama made me hungry\~\. Let's dig right into Mai and Juujou-san's special made flower viewing bento\!  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono, we cannot get ahead of ourselves\. The proper procedure of a flower viewing party is to first admire the cherry blossoms, then share a toast\. After that, we admire the cherry blossoms again, then it will be time to eat\.  
**Kofuki:** Then let's hurry this up and get to the toast already\. My throats dried out from all that playing around with aradama-chan\.  
**Tsugumi:** I thought this might happen, so I planned ahead and prepared a special flower viewing version of a drink to stimulate recovery after combat\.  
**Kiyoka:** A-And did you make that drink yourself, Tsugumi-san\.\.\.?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes\. Using amazake as a base, I supplemented it with various spices and ingredients to prepare for an outdoor party during this chilly time of year\.  
**Chie:** I think I won't be needing a drink after all\.  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah, me too\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Are you sure? I even adjusted the color so it would match the cherry blossoms\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** It looks pretty\.\.\. Tsugumi, I think\.\.\. I'll drink some\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** I'll try it too\. I wouldn't want the work you put into getting it ready for our flower viewing party to go to waste\.  
**Ellen:** It is a party, after all\. Hm\.\.\.? Tsugumin, where did the bottle of your drink go?  
**Kaoru:** Oi, Yui, that bottle you're chugging down\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Glug, glug, glug\.\.\. Phwaah\~\! I can't tell if that tasted good or bad, but give me another one\!  
**Sayaka:** Yui\.\.\. Did you drink the whole bottle?  
**Hiyori:** She said it's supposed to help with recovery, but would it really be safe drinking that much?  
**Yui:** When I started drinking it down, I just couldn't stop myself\. Actually, what's with this stuff\!? My body's burning up all of a sudden\!  
**Tsugumi:** I see, if you drink that much at once, the body rapidly begins to warm itself\.\.\. I've gained some unexpectedly useful data from this\.  
**Yui:** Ahh\~, everything's warm and fuzzy, like it's the middle of summer\! I just want to leave my uniform behind, throw on a swimsuit, and hop in the sea-\!  
**Yui:** Ah\.\.\. What if, if everyone drinks this, then you'll all start heating up, and we can have our flower viewing party in swimsuits\!?  
**Mirja:** What a corrupt line of thinking\.\.\.  
**Yui:** I found another bottle\! Here, Sayaka-chan, Hiyori-chan, take a good long gulp of this\! Come on, open wide\!  
**Kiyoka:** Yui-chan, you're like an old man coming up to bother young girls in the park\.\.\.  
**Yui:** C'mon, c'mon\! Have a drink\~\! Have a drink\~\!  
**Sayaka:** Yui\.\.\. You're scaring me\.\.\. I\.\.\. Don't want any\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Yeah, I'm saying no too\.  
**Yui:** Ehh\~, that's so boring\~\. Then, I'm gonna walk around over there and see if there's any pretty ladies I can offer a drink\!  
**Yui:** Hey\! Hey you, miss\! Want to enjoy a hot time under the cherry blossoms with me\!  
**Chie:** It seems Yui-chan has skipped right over spring and gone into summer\.\.\. But the rest of us can start our flower viewing party now\.  
**Hiyori:** Right\. It feels good to have spring back to normal\. So, is everyone ready to do our toast?  
**Hiyori:** Since you organized all this, you should lead the toast, Chie\.  
**Chie:** Alright then\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.No, actually, why don't we let Itomi-san lead us?  
**Sayaka:** I'm doing it?  
**Chie:** You worked very hard, didn't you? That's why, I'd like to ask you to do it\.  
**Sayaka:** I understand, I'll do my best\.\.\. Should I start?  
**Mai:** Sure, we're all ready\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.I'm glad we could all see the flowers\. Cheers\.  
**Everyone:** Cheers\!\!
