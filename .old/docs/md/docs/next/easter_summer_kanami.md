## [Easter - Kanami: Start\]: Attempting the Egg Hunt\!
**Ellen:** Kanamin\! Want to do an egg hunt with everyone, to celebrate Easter?  
**Kanami:** An egg hunt? What's that?  
**Ellen:** It's a fun event you do on Easter day\. You hide colorful painted eggs in the park, and everyone competes to find them\!  
**Kanami:** That sounds fun\! I knew you painted eggs for Easter, but I didn't know there was a game to look for them\!  
**Ellen:** For starters, the day before we do the egg hunt, do you want to make Easter eggs?  
**Kanami:** Yeah, I want to try\! I'll ask Hiyori-chan to come too\!  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan wasn't in the classrooms or the dorms; I wonder where she went\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Alright then, let's all get started making Easter eggs\! Go ahead and draw nice designs on the eggs we have here\!  
**Kanami:** Huh? These eggs feel pretty light\. What kind of eggs are they\.\.\.? Wait, now that I look closer, there's a hole in the bottom and it's hollow inside\! Ellen-chan, what'd you do with these eggs?  
**Ellen:** We took out the insides earlier, with Saaya and Maimai helping me\. It'd be a shame if any of the eggs broke halfway through\.  
**Sayaka:** It was a little hard to do\.\.\. But it was fun\.  
**Mai:** Right now, Hiyori-chan is using the insides to cook for us\. She'll be making a full course meal of egg related dishes for dinner tonight, so look forward to it\.  
**Kanami:** So Hiyori-chan was in the cooking room-? I wanted to make Easter eggs with her here though\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** I told her the same thing, but she said she's better at cooking than painting, so she wanted to be in charge of that\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** So that's why\.  
**Ellen:** It's too bad we don't have Hiyoyon with us, but let's go ahead and get right to painting the eggs\! Here's pictures of examples for us to use\.  
**Kanami:** Wow, all the eggs look so cute and colorful\!  
**Mai:** There's a lot of bright, spring-feeling colors, so just looking over them feels exciting\.  
**Sayaka:** What do we do with these eggs after we finish painting them?  
**Ellen:** We'll all go hide them in the park before tomorrow's egg hunt\.  
**Mai:** Though, with all these flashy designs, won't the eggs be found right away?  
**Ellen:** There's plenty of colorful flowers in the park this time of spring, so they'll be harder to find than you think\.  
**Kanami:** Really? Then, I'll go with pink, and yellow, and greenish-yellow, and\~\!  
**Tsugumi:** I thought it sounded lively in here\. So you're all making Easter eggs?  
**Kanami:** Tsugumi-san\! Want to make some together with us?  
**Tsugumi:** Thank you for asking\. But I've already finished making my own custom made Easter eggs\.  
**Tsugumi:** I added something to them to make the egg hunt more exciting, so look forward to it\.  
**Kanami:** Ah, Tsugumi-saaan\! \.\.\.She already left\. I wonder what she did to them\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.I wonder if it's okay\.\.\.

## [Easter - Kanami: End\]: In a Fervor\! The Spring Egg Hunt
Easter day\.

  
**Ellen:** Did everyone get their outfits on right?  
**Kanami:** Yep\! These clothes are so cute it's getting me worked up\.  
**Mai:** I know; the pastel spring colors give them all that cute touch\. Though, I never knew there were Easter events you dressed up for\.  
**Sayaka:** I didn't either\.  
**Ellen:** The costumes aren't a must, but fancy hats and spring-colored clothes are another way to enjoy Easter\.  
**Ellen:** Kiyoka, Fukki, and Yuiyui worked their hardest to make these\.  
**Kanami:** Wearing these neat clothes and looking for eggs makes me feel like I just stepped into a picture book\!  
**Ellen:** It's about time we got started, but, Hiyoyon isn't here, is she?  
**Kaoru:** I haven't seen her all morning\. She might've burned out making that full course of eggs yesterday\.  
**Kanami:** The food last night was incredible too\. I guess I'll have to work extra hard for Hiyori-chan today\! I'll find a whole bunch and come in first-\!  
**Ellen:** Everyone, the egg hunt is just about over\! Did you get a lot of hunting done?  
**Mihono:** Totally\! That was so fun, like a treasure hunt-\.  
**Hiyori:** Yeah, the most important thing is everyone had fun doing it\.  
**Mai:** Huh? Hiyori-chan, I thought you were taking the day off to rest\. You sure have a whole lot of eggs\.  
**Hiyori:** Well\.\.\. I guess I do\. So, who's the winner of this?  
**Ellen:** When everyone gets back, we'll count the eggs and decide a winner; though, in the meantime, how about we tidy up?  
**Ellen:** It'd be an issue if we left eggs here in the park, so please check over everywhere you hid them\.  
**Kanami:** Okaaay\! Hiyori-chan, let's go look together\.  
**Hiyori:** Sure\.  
**Kanami:** It looks like people got to all the eggs that I hid\. Maybe where I left them was a little too easy to find\. \.\.\.Huh?  
**Hiyori:** Nn? Did you find something, Kanami?  
**Kanami:** There's a ton of ducks under that tree over there\. I wonder why?  
**Hiyori:** You're right, it's weird to see that many gathered around\. But why\.\.\. Ahhh\! The ducks are flocking around easter eggs\.  
**Tsugumi:** They're all eggs that I left there\. I spread them out across multiple locations, but in no time there were ducks gathered around each\.  
**Kanami:** Ehh? What, does that mean the ducks were joining in on the egg hunt?  
**Tsugumi:** That's about right\. Actually, in order to make this event more exciting, I thought, wouldn't it be fun if animals were to join in too?  
**Tsugumi:** So I coated the insides of the egg with ingredients giving various scents that animals love\. But\.\.\. I had no idea ducks would be this persistent\.  
**Hiyori:** Well, now's not the time to get impressed with it\. We can't leave things like this; we have to hurry up and get those eggs back\.  
**Kanami:** You're right, but we're going to have to be brave enough to jump into the middle of all them\.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm sorry about this\.\.\. I know; I have a good idea\. I'll attract the ducks here using the scents I coated the eggs with, so could you use that chance to get the eggs?  
**Hiyori:** Alright, so you'll be the bait\. Let's go with that\.  
**Tsugumi:** Come here duckies, over this way\. You all love the smell of this\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Okay, the ducks went after Tsugumi\. Kanami, get the eggs in the basket while you can\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah\. Ummm, one, two, three\.\.\. Okay, I got them all\!  
**Kanami:** Whoa, I got surrounded by ducks\! Save me, Hiyori-chan-\!  
**Hiyori:** Mmgh, are you alright, Kanami? Pass the eggs in the basket over here\.  
**Kanami:** Wahh\! That duck took one of the eggs\! Give it back-\!  
**Hiyori:** Hey, don't bite my basket\! There's no eggs in this one\.  
**Tsugumi:** I wonder what's causing that? The ducks seem to be more attracted to the scent on the eggs than what I originally coated them with\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** WAHH\!\! I got the egg back, but now the pack of ducks are after me-\! Hiyori-chan, pass\!  
**Hiyori:** Hey, Kanami\! Don't go throwing eggs\! And now the ducks are coming my way\.  
**Tsugumi:** The egg hunt turned out far more exciting than I was expecting, from the looks of it\.  
**Kanami:** Don't go sounding proud about it now-\! Help us, Tsugumi-san-\!\!

## [Summer Uniform 20 - Kanami: Start\]: In Danger of Failing\!?
**Kanami:** Help me, Hiyori-chan\! At this rate, I'm gonna fail\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Sigh\.  
**Hiyori:** That's not going to be possible\. Go find someone else\.  
**Kanami:** Don't tell me that\~\! Teach me how to study\~\!  
**Hiyori:** I told you it's impossible, didn't I?  
**Hiyori:** And besides, why me? What about Mai?  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan's on a mission\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Alright then\. But it's still impossible\.  
**Kanami:** Stop being so mean\~\!  
**Hiyori:** That's not what I meant\. I meant it's impossible for me to teach someone\.  
**Hiyori:** The most I'll be able to tell you is to read the textbook and solve the example problems, alright?  
**Hiyori:** What subject do you need help with, anyway?  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Math\.  
**Hiyori:** Just memorize the formulas and solve the problems\.  
**Kanami:** If I could do that, I wouldn't be asking you to teach me\~\!  
**Hiyori:** Probably\. But that's what I'm saying\. Teaching is out of the question for me\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.I guess\.  
**Hiyori:** Why don't you get someone different to teach you? Like Ellen; aren't math and science her strong suits?  
**Kanami:** Ellen-chan and Kaoru-chan are on missions too\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** O-Oh\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Sorry, Hiyori-chan, for asking too much from you\. I'll study on my own\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Sigh, what can I do with you\. Give me a minute\.  
**Hiyori:** Iwakura-san? This is Juujou\.\.\. Do you have time right now?  
**Hiyori:** Actually, there's a favor I need from you\.\.\. I need your help on studying\.  
**Hiyori:** No, not with me\. With Kanami\. Yeah, from Minoseki\.\.\. Right\.\.\. Nn? That's\.\.\. okay with you?  
**Hiyori:** Ahh, so that's how it is\. If that's the case, she'd actually be glad to go along with it\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Alright, thanks for the help\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Sigh\. Tomorrow after school, wait in class\.  
**Kanami:** Iwakura-san's going to teach me?  
**Hiyori:** Go and make sure you do what she tells you\.  
**Kanami:** Thanks, Hiyori-chan\!

**Kanami:** Ayanokouji? You're from Heijou though, Iwakura-san\.\.\.?  
**Mayumi:** I'm the one who asked for her assistance\!

**Kanami/Mayumi:** Alright\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Ughh, math is too hard after all\.\.\. How am I supposed to solve this one, Iwakura-san\.\.\.?  
**Sanae:** This is where you use the equation from before\. You put this in here\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Put this, here\.\.\.?  
**Sanae:** That's it\.  
**Sanae:** (Etou-san is good at picking things up\.\.\. Is she just not good at sitting through lectures?\)  
**Mayumi:** Hmm\.\.\.  
**Sanae:** Was there something you didn't get?  
**Mayumi:** Yes, right here\! But, please let me think on it a little more for myself\.  
**Mayumi:** My grades aren't very good to begin with, so I'll need to think on these myself first\.  
**Sanae:** Oh\. Okay, I get it\.  
**Sanae:** (Hasui-san is a hard worker\. Maybe the type who moves a little slower than others, but steadily improves on herself\.\)  
**Kanami:** And you do this here\.\.\. I did it\!

**Mayumi:** Thank you very much, Iwakura-senpai\! This was a very enriching use of time\!  
**Sanae:** We're still not done yet, you know? Next comes the important part for you, right, Hasui-san?  
**Mayumi:** Eh? \.\.\.Ah\!  
**Kanami:** We're all training together, right\!  
**Sanae:** Etou-san's skills are top class among toji, so let's both try our best\.  
**Mayumi:** I'll be in your care, Etou-san\!  
**Kanami:** Sure\! I'm looking forward to seeing your swordfighting too, Hasui-san, Iwakura-san\!
