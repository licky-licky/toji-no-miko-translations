## [London - Kanami: Start\]: I Want to Go on a Trip
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** Nn? Oh, it's you, Kanami\.  
**Kanami:** So you were on this assignment too, Hiyori-chan\.  
**Hiyori:** That's what it looks like\.  
**Kanami:** For some reason, it feels like it's been a while since I saw you\.  
**Hiyori:** We've both been busy being sent out all over the place\.  
**Kanami:** I'm not as bad as Kaoru-chan, but it makes me want a vacation too\.  
**Hiyori:** A vacation, huh\. Seems like that'll be unlikely for a while\.  
**Hiyori:** But, assuming we could get a vacation, what would you want to do?  
**Kanami:** Hmm\.\.\. I'd want to go on a trip, I guess?  
**Hiyori:** Going on a trip\.\.\. That doesn't sound too bad\. Would be nice to go to some hot springs and heal off all the daily fatigue\.  
**Hiyori:** Where do you want to go, Kanami?  
**Kanami:** Hmm, let's see\. I think I'd like to go on a trip overseas\!  
**Kanami:** Like, to the USA, for example\. I'd want Ellen-chan to take me around to all the American dojos\!  
**Hiyori:** American dojos\.\.\.? Well, that sounds like a trip you'd go on\.  
**Kanami:** I'll bet they feel different from the ones here in Japan, so it'll be fun for sure\!  
**Hiyori:** If you had Ellen with you, it'd probably get that much more noisy\.  
**Kanami:** And then, I'd want to go to the usual places, like Hawaii, and also, I think I'm interested in going to Europe too\!  
**Hiyori:** To see the dojos there too?  
**Kanami:** Yeah\! I want to check it out\! Though, how much western style swordfighting do you think is still around in Europe?  
**Hiyori:** As far as what level's still in practice\.\.\. I'm not really sure\.  
**Hiyori:** Though, Europe refers to a big place\. There's a lot of countries there, you know?  
**Hiyori:** Was there any country you wanted to go visit in particular?  
**Kanami:** Hmm, I guess I'd have to see England first? I want to go to London\!  
**Hiyori:** London\.\.\. The most I know about it comes from Sherlock Holmes\.  
**Kanami:** Ah\! Sherlock Holmes\! That's good\! When we get to London, let's do stuff like Sherlock Holmes\!  
**Hiyori:** Wh-What\!?  
**Hiyori:** What do you mean, stuff like Sherlock Holmes\!?

## [London - Kanami: End\]: Stuff Like Holmes\.\.\.?
**Kanami:** Phew, we somehow managed to jump across to this trolley, Hiyori-chan\.  
**Hiyori:** Right\. The jewels we're after are on the inside\.  
**Kanami:** Yeah\! But\.\.\. They're bound to have Scotland Yard's finest on security, so we'd better be careful\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.If you're going to warn me to be careful, try not giggling when you do it\.  
**Kanami:** But, come on, they're going to have their top class guards stationed in there\!?  
**Kanami:** What kind of fighting style do you think they'll use? Isn't it exciting, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** Now you're saying the polar opposite of before\. Weren't we supposed to be careful?  
**Kanami:** We'll have fun while we're being careful\!  
**Hiyori:** There's just no helping you, is there\.\.\. Let's move in\!  
**Maki:** I heard a noise over this way\! Intruders\!  
**Suzuka:** Hopping aboard the car we're guarding; you phantom thieves have run out of luck\.  
**Hiyori:** Wait, we're the thieves, not the detectives\!?  
**Kanami:** See, Hiyori-chan\. Holmes is a master of Baritsu, right?  
**Kanami:** So I'd want to fight him\. Which means, we've gotta be phantom thieves\!  
**Hiyori:** "Gotta be phantom thieves"? Really\!? And also, Holmes wasn't even there\!  
**Kanami:** Then maybe\.\.\. Instead of working together, would it be a better setup if I came to steal you, Hiyori-chan?  
**Kanami:** "I've come to steal you away, Hiyori-chan\!" Like that\.  
**Hiyori:** Are you listening to me\!? And anyway, you're the one kidnapping me\!?  
**Kanami:** Would you rather steal me?  
**Kanami:** Like, "I'm here to steal you away, Kanami\."  
**Announcement:** We have confirmed the appearance of aradama\. I repeat--  
**Hiyori:** --\!\! Kanami, let's leave this off here\!  
**Kanami:** Yeah\!  
**Hiyori:** It's going to be a long time before we can think about that vacation\.  
**Kanami:** That's for sure\. It's disappointing, but, we won't be able to vacation in peace until the aradama calm down some more\.  
**Hiyori:** I know\.  
**Kanami:** Once things settle down\.\.\. Let's all go on a trip together\.  
**Hiyori:** When that time comes, I'll go with you wherever, to London or anywhere\.  
**Hiyori:**ã€€But let's get going, Kanami\!  
**Kanami:** Okay, Hiyori-chan\!

## [Halloween '19 - Kanami: Start\]: Starting Halloween with Sweet Pie
**Kanami:** Mmm, Mai-chan's pumpkin pie is so good\~\!  
**Mai:** I'm glad you like it, Kanami-chan\.  
**Kanami:** Did you bring this pie over to Sayaka-chan and them? She said she was filming a movie with Kitora-san, right?  
**Kanami:** Apparently the director from that time with the period drama invited them\.  
**Mai:** Mm-mm, I thought I'd let Sayaka-chan have it after she gets back\.  
**Mai:** I can be careful, but it would be bad if the pie were damaged on the way\.  
**Hiyori:** That's probably for the best\. Ohm\.\.\. The sweets you make really are delicious, Mai\.  
**Mai:** Thank you, Hiyori-chan\. If you'd like, let's make some together next time\.  
**Hiyori:** Alright\. I've never made something like this before, but you teaching me would be a good chance to learn\. I'll be counting on you\.  
**Mai:** Sure\!  
**Yui:** Ah, you three were in here\!  
**Yui:** Happy Halloween\~\! Kanami-chan, Hiyori-chan, annnd, Mai-chan\! Trick or treat\~?  
**Mai:** Here, Yui-chan, have a bite of this\.  
**Yui:** Oh\! Did you make this, Mai-chan? I'll have some\~\. Mmm\~, so good\!  
**Kanami:** Yui-chan, were you looking for us for something?  
**Yui:** I'm passing the word on from Kiyoka-chan\. The costume party we're having is going to be at an amusement park\.  
**Yui:** So, anybody who wants to get seriously dressed up, meet in an hour out in front of school\!  
**Kanami:** Ehh, that's so cool\! Let's go, Hiyori-chan, Mai-chan\!  
**Mai:** We might as well\.  
**Hiyori:** So, when Kiyoka said we could rent our costumes, she meant from the amusement park?  
**Yui:** I've got to make the rounds and let the other girls know, so I'll be seeing you later\~\.  
**Yui:** And, if you see anybody, be sure to tell them too, okay\~?  
**Kanami:** We got it-\. Thanks, Yui-chan\!  
**Mai:** How about we get going then?  
**Kanami:** Ah, sure\! Though, we still have some time left, so I want to have at least one more slice of pie\~\.  
**Mai:** Of course you can\.  
**Kanami:** The sweets you make are just addictively good, Mai-chan\! Makes me want to have some every single day\! Anyway-- down the hatch-\.

## [Halloween '19 - Kanami: End\]: Dressing Up Might be Fun\!
**Kanami:** I can't wait to see what everyone's costumes are like\.  
**Hiyori:** Come to think of it, what's everybody else dressing up as? They said they had this and that\.  
**Kanami:** Ellen-chan said she'd be dressing up like a wolf, didn't she? Yui-chan, do you know? For Kiyoka-chan and everybody\.  
**Yui:** I told Kiyoka-chan she should dress up like a witch and little red riding hood, but she wouldn't wear those costumes in the end\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.You gave her something weird to wear, didn't you?  
**Yui:** Eh-- The skirt was just a liiittle bit short is all\!?  
**Kanami:** Ahaha\.\.\. I'm pretty sure that's the reason\.  
**Yui:** But, I'd love to see Kiyoka-chan all dressed up in costume if I could\. And Chie-san and Mihono-chan too, of course\!  
**Kanami:** I'm sure you would, Yui-chan\. We should hurry over there then\.  
**Kanami:** Whoaa--\! They're even letting us take photos up here-\!  
**Kanami:** C'mon Hiyori-chan, get a good look\.  
**Hiyori:** Yeah, it's a great view\. I guess it's how they set it up, but it really looks like nighttime\.  
**Kanami:** They're probably trying to make it look more Halloween\.  
**Hiyori:** But, is this really alright? Us taking photos here\.  
**Yui:** Seems like it's fine\. You can't see it from right here, but just under this there's a space and a fence to stop people from falling, just in case\.  
**Kanami:** Safety first, even when you're having fun\.  
**Kanami:** It'd be dangerous if little kids were jumping around, but a quick photo shoot should be fine\.  
**Yui:** So, Kanami-chan, strike a pose for me\!  
**Kanami:** A pose? How's this?  
**Yui:** That's good, Kanami-chan, so good\! It's got that\.\.\. "This world of night belongs to me--" feeling\!  
**Kanami:** Ehehe\.\.\. Getting dressed up and cosplaying might be kinda fun?  
**Kanami:** Ah, Hiyori-chan\. Since we're both vampires, how about we get our picture taken together?  
**Hiyori:** Alright\. Can we get in a little closer?  
**Kanami:** That might be tricky\.  
**Yui:** What are you two saying? You're pairing up for a shot, so you've got to get right up on each other\!  
**Yui:** So close you're practically hugging\!  
**Hiyori:** Wha\!?  
**Kanami:** Like this?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Ka-Kanami\!? Th-That's too close\.  
**Yui:** Niiice going, Kanami-chan\~\.  
**Hiyori:** Doing this kind of thing is nice every now and then\.  
**Kanami:** Yeah\. We should all go together for Halloween again next year\!  
**Kanami:** Ah, but before that, there's the cultural festival, Christmas, New Year's, Valentines\. There's a lot of stuff that could be fun\.  
**Hiyori:** There sure is\.
