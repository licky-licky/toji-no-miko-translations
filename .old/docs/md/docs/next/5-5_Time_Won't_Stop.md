## 1: Where I Belong
**Mihono:** \.\.\.I'm back\!  
**Tsugumi:** Welcome back, Asakura-san\.  
**Mihono:** Tsugumi-san\! And\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** This room hasn't changed one bit, huh\.  
**Kofuki:** Well duh, why would it change?  
**Mihono:** Shut up, Fukki\! You're ruining the moment\!  
**Kofuki:** What, were you feeling like crying again?  
**Mihono:** Th-That's not what I'm saying\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Fufu, how about I pour us some tea? Kiyoka-chan, can you give me a hand?  
**Kiyoka:** Sure\!  
**Yui:** I'll help out too-\.  
**Kofuki:** I'll take some milk-\.  
**Tsugumi:** Ah, if you mean the milk you bought before, Shichinosato-san, there's none left\.  
**Kofuki:** Huh\!? Where'd it go\!  
**Tsugumi:** It was nearly the expiration date, so I drank it\.  
**Kofuki:** There was still some time left, wasn't there\!? And hey, if you drank it, then buy me a new one\!  
**Mirja:** That's enough talking about milk\. It's time we discussed the issue at hand\.  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono\. Can you tell us about what happened with Hitakami Makoto?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I can\.  
**Mihono:** Umm, after all the things they said, my head's honestly a mess right now\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** But, if Hitakami-san's telling the truth, then\.\.\. there's a great aradama inside me\.  
**Everyone:** \!?  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Do you mean that, Hono-chan?  
**Mihono:** When Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power was rampaging\.\.\. That was really all the powers of this great aradama called Kanayamahime\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Hey, Mihono-chan?  
**Chie:** Why did\.\.\. Makoto know all this\.\.\.?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.I'm wondering the same\.  
**Mirja:** In whichever records we looked, there was nothing pertaining to Kashuu Kiyomitsu or the Asakura family\.  
**Mirja:** Where did Hitakami Makoto find this information?  
**Mihono:** It sounds like she's\.\.\. a distant relative of mine\. Hitakami-san's and my family\.\.\. Apparently, we used to be the Atago family\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Atago\.\.\. you say?  
**Mihono:** And apparently, five hundred years ago, a miko from the Atago family sealed the great aradama in her own body\.  
**Mihono:** That great aradama got passed down all this time by the Atago\.\.\. the Asakura family\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** So then, why's it waking up now? Wasn't it fine for five hundred years?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Does it have something to do with the tip of Kashuu Kiyomitsu breaking off\.\.\.?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.It's difficult to say anything in our current situation\. We don't have enough information to draw any conclusions\.  
**Mirja:** At any rate, our immediate next step should be to verify the factuality of what we've learned\. Not everything Hitakami Makoto said may necessarily be true\.  
**Chie:** We'll do something about this, whatever it takes\. I promise I'll get you through this, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\.\.\.  
**Chie:** So please\.\.\. Don't do anything reckless again\. Promise me\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Mm\. I promise\.  
**Yui:** Hey hey, let's leave the serious talk at that and switch over to talking about our sleepover\!  
**Mihono:** Our sleepover?  
**Kiyoka:** That's right\!  
**Kiyoka:** You've been looking down lately, haven't you, Hono-chan? So we were talking about buying a bunch of snacks and having a sleepover with everyone\.  
**Kofuki:** Won't have to worry about breaking your wallet either, Mihocchi\. Cause Chichie and Mirja are paying, right?  
**Mirja:** That was our agreement\.  
**Kofuki:** See?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Fukki\.\.\. Thanks\.  
**Kofuki:** For what?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.I dunno? But, I felt like I should tell you\.  
**Kofuki:** Alright then\.  
**Tsugumi:** Asakura-san, while they prepare for the sleepover, could you come along with me for a bit?  
**Tsugumi:** Kanayamahime\.\.\. I think I could get good data from that\.  
**Kofuki:** Could you try to read the mood?  
**Tsugumi:** To have Shichinosato-san tell me that\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, it's captured my interest, so I don't think there's anything I can do about it?  
**Kofuki:** Do something about it\!  
**Mihono:** Ahaha\!  
**Mihono:** (Good\.\.\. Everybody's still the same as always\. As long as they're here, I know it'll be alright\.\)  

## 2: Phone Call
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\! This one is the old maid, isn't it\!  
**Mihono:** Ahh\!?  
**Mirja:** That finishes it\.  
**Mihono:** Uwaahhh\!? I lost again-\!\!  
**Kofuki:** You suck at this, Mihocchi\.\.\. And hey, we ran out of drinks\.  
**Chie:** Now's a good time, so let's take a break\.  
**Yui:** Ah, then, I'm going to step outside for a minute-\.  
**Kofuki:** Go buy us something to drink while you're at it-\.  
**Yui:** Sure thing-\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Phew\. Alright, I've gotta make sure to let her know\.  
**Hana:** \.\.\.What is it?  
**Yui:** It's been a while, Hana-san\. I thought you weren't going to pick up\.  
**Hana:** It didn't seem like it was ever going stop ringing\. \.\.\.What did you need?  
**Yui:** I didn't need anything, it's more like\.\.\. I had to tell you something? It's about Mihono-chan\.  
**Hana:** What about Mihono?  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Do you know what the Hitakami faction is?  
**Hana:** That came out of nowhere\.\.\. Though, I've heard the name before at least\.  
**Yui:** Well, it seems like they're getting into experiments like with the Myouga toji project\.  
**Hana:** Myouga\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hana:** What does that have to do with Mihono?  
**Yui:** While you haven't been here, there's seriously been so much that's happened\.\.\.  
**Yui:** So much that it'd take too long to get it all out\.  
**Hana:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Hana-san, whatever happens, you'll be there for Mihono-chan, right?  
**Hana:** Yui?  
**Yui:** I'm sorry\.\.\. It's just\.\.\. Whenever things calm down, it's like it all comes over me\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Maybe it's because I heard your voice, I guess\.  
**Hana:** \.\.\.What happened?  
**Yui:** Please give me an answer\.  
**Hana:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Of course I will\.  
**Yui:** There's a great aradama, Kanayamahime, sealed inside of Mihono-chan's body\.  
**Hana:** \!? An evil god\.\.\. like with Yukari-sama and Hiyori-san\.\.\.\!?  
**Hana:** What about Mihono\!? Is she alright\!?  
**Yui:** For now, she's still doing okay\. But\.\.\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Come back to us, Hana-san\. We can help Mihono-chan together\!  
**Hana:** I\.\.\.  
**Hana:** I'm sorry\.  
**Yui:** Hana-san\!  
**Hana:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Just give me a little longer\. I promise\.\.\. I'll be back\.  
**Hana:** So just, give me a little more time\.\.\.  

## 3: A Private Conversation (1\)
**Chie:** They're fast asleep now, aren't they\. Even though they were so noisy all night\.  
**Mirja:** They must be tired\. After all that's happened, I can't blame them\.  
**Chie:** Though, this works out well\. There's something I wanted to talk about with you\.  
**Mirja:** It's about Asakura Mihono, isn't it\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.What Makoto said\.\.\. about Kanayamahime\. Do you think it's true?  
**Mirja:** This is only my personal opinion, but\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** That power going rampant\.\.\. I find it easier to accept it as the power of an evil god than the power of an okatana\.  
**Chie:** That\.\.\. makes sense\.  
**Chie:** What exactly\.\.\. should we be doing? What could we do, to support Mihono-chan\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** There are too many unknowns right now that I don't know where to begin solving it\.  
**Mirja:** Let's ask for support from those around us while continuing to search through the records\.  
**Mirja:** And, while this may be coming too late, we need to keep close watch for any changes in Asakura Mihono\.\.\.  
**Chie:** How is that any different from what we were already doing\!? That's what made Mihono-chan go to Makoto for help\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Ah\. I'm sorry, for raising my voice\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.You don't need to apologize\. I feel the same as you\.  
**Mirja:** However, we are also responsible for what happened with the Hitakamis, by allowing Asakura Mihono to move freely\. We can't allow ourselves to make the same mistake again\.  
**Chie:** I know\. Next time, I'll be there for Mihono-chan, no matter what\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.\.\.\.It isn't good to be overly eager about it either\.  
**Chie:** But, if this goes on and the great aradama awakens, there's no doubt Mihono-chan will be a target for suppression\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.It would come to that, wouldn't it\. As a great aradama, Asakura Mihono would be threat to humanity\.  
**Chie:** I'm not going to let her end up like Yukari-sama did\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.We won't\.  
**Mirja:** First, we should look to the judgment of our superiors\. \.\.\.Though I'd rather not\. I wish I could keep this from being reported\.  
**Chie:** Even you're feeling that way, Mirja?  
**Mirja:** Of course I am\. What do you think of me?  
**Chie:** Sorry, it's just a little unexpected\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.I understand that would only be running away from the issue, but I don't want this to become known by anyone\.  
**Mirja:** The response to Asakura Mihono carrying Kanayamahime is not going to be a lenient one\.\.\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.I'll help look through the records with you\.  
**Mirja:** That would help\.  
**Chie:** Do you think that\.\.\. there's any way to pull Kanayamahime out of Mihono-chan, or make the seal stable?  
**Mirja:** It's a slim chance to hope for\. However, it's all we can do\.  
**Mirja:** That, and one more thing\.\.\.  
**Chie:** What's that?  
**Mirja:** Should we remove Asakura Mihono from her duties?  

## 4: A Private Conversation (2\)
**Mihono:** Does that mean\.\.\. you're taking me off the investigation team?  
**Mihono:** But I don't want that\! I want to stay with the team\!  
**Mirja:** Please calm down\.  
**Mihono:** Hey, say something too, Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** Listen to us, Mihono-chan\.  
**Chie:** We aren't saying to take you out of the investigation team\. It's the opposite\.  
**Chie:** We want you to support us, so that you can still stay in the investigation team\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.What does that mean?  
**Mirja:** Going about it this way has two benefits\. The first is\.\.\. for political reasons\.  
**Mihono:** Political?  
**Mirja:** Information about Kanayamahime will be reported to the government by the Sword Administration Bureau\.  
**Mirja:** That's where they would decide how to deal with you\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Mirja:** We want to lower your chances of being re-assigned somewhere besides the investigation team as much as we can\.  
**Mirja:** The fact that the investigation team has chosen this option, and that you would abide by it, shows the investigation team is trying to minimize the risk of the great aradama awakening\.  
**Mirja:** I am not sure if this is the best option\.\.\. But, we want to do whatever we can, no matter how small\.  
**Mihono:** (The government\.\.\.? The conversation's gotten so big my head's spinning\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** (Umm\.\.\. The government won't want the great aradama to wake up\. That's what I want too\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** (If that's the case, then\.\.\. They might think it'd be better if I wasn't with the investigation team\.\.\. Wait?\)  
**Mihono:** (Would it be better if I left\.\.\.?\)  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** What's the second one?  
**Chie:** For practical reasons\.\.\. We can buy a little more time for you\.  
**Chie:** The more time we have to find a solution for you, the better\.  
**Chie:** Though, you might be feeling worried in the meantime\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** (Chii-nee and Mirja-san are both thinking really hard of how I can stay in the investigation team\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** (But\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** Would it be better if\.\.\. I wasn't in the investigation team?  
**Chie/Mirja:** That's not true\!/That isn't the case\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Please, Mihono-chan\. At least until we can find a way to deal with this\.\.\.  
**Chie:** I want you to wait and believe in us\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Okay\.  
**Mihono:** (It's alright\. I know I can believe in you\.\)  
**Mihono:** I'll be here to support you then\!  
**Mihono:** (I know they'll come up with a good idea, won't they\.\.\.\)  

## 5: I'm Not Giving Up (1\)
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I was always wondering\. Why I was seeing this dream\.  
**Mihono:** I thought it was Kashuu Kiyomitsu showing it to me, but that's not it\.  
**Mihono:** You're Kanayamahime, aren't you?  
**Mihono:** Why are you doing this to me?  
**Mihono:** Give me an answer\!\!  
**Mihono:** -\!?  
**Mihono:** You're attacking me? Now that I know what you are, you don't care what happens anymore?  
**Mihono:** KYAH\!?  
**Mihono:** Uuu\.\.\. This is just\.\.\. too much\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\!?  
**Mihono:** Urgh\.\.\. The power, feels like it's going to burst out of me\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I can't\.\.\.\! I can't lose control, not here\.\.\.\!  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan\!? Are you okay in there, Mihono-chan\!?  
**Mihono:** Kanami?  
**Kanami:** You're still conscious, aren't you?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Sorry, just give me a minute\.\.\. If I move\.\.\. right now\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Keep a strong grip on yourself\!  
**Mihono:** Juujou-san\.\.\.?  
**Hiyori:** Don't worry, we're here with you\. So just focus on keeping your power in check\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Okay\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Okay, I'm fine now, I think\.  
**Mihono:** Sorry you had to wait, Kanami, Juujou-san\! I'll unlock the door now\.  
**Kanami:** Mihono-chan\.\.\. Are you fine now?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Yeah\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Thank goodness\.  
**Hiyori:** I was having breakfast with Kanami when something felt wrong\.  
**Hiyori:** I hoped we'd have come over here for nothing, but\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** We've heard about how Kashuu Kiyomitsu's power is rampaging\.  
**Mihono:** Huh\!?  
**Hiyori:** I got a call from Kiyoka\. She said you were in trouble\. Asking if I knew anything that could help\.  
**Kanami:** And Kaoru told me, if I knew anything, I should go tell it to you\.  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan too, she said Sayaka-chan asked her about it\.  
**Kanami:** We're all worried about you, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** (Kiyoka\.\.\. Thanks, everybody\.\)  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Inside of me, there's a great aradama\.  

## 6: I'm Not Giving Up (2\)
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Inside of me, there's a great aradama\.  
**Mihono:** The two of you noticed something, right? That's why you came here all panicked\.  
**Kanami:** I had a kind of bad feeling about this\.\.\. But I hoped it wouldn't be that\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** The power of a great aradama\.\.\. It's not something a person can keep under control\. If it's not Kashuu Kiyomitsu, but a great aradama's power that you're losing control of\.\.\. That explains what you're so worried about\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Yeah\.  
**Hiyori:** A great aradama isn't something someone can resist for years and years\. If that great aradama wakes up in you\.\.\. If you can't keep a firm resolve, you won't be able to hold onto yourself\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Ah, I'm sorry\. This isn't something you need to be hearing right now\.  
**Mihono:** No, I get it\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** It's just\.\.\. Why did all this have to happen\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** This great aradama, it was always with you, wasn't it, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Would it be possible\.\.\. for you to try getting along with it, or something?  
**Mihono:** I don't really know, but\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** I won't tell you that's impossible, but\.\.\. I don't agree with the idea\. The moment the great aradama awakens, it's possible Mihono's sense of self will be snuffed out\. You shouldn't take this lightly\.  
**Kanami:** Ah\.\.\. Sorry\.  
**Mihono:** It's alright\! I know that you're thinking about how to help me, Kanami\!  
**Hiyori:** Mihono\. Was there anything passed down for times like these, to deal with the great aradama?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.I don't think there is\.  
**Hiyori:** I see\. Though, you should try asking at least\.  
**Mihono:** O-Okay, I'll ask Grandpa about it\.  
**Hiyori:** And also\.\.\. Don't give up hope\.  
**Mihono:** Huh?  
**Hiyori:** The unease you're feeling\.\.\. I know it too well\.  
**Hiyori:** But, you have friends with you\. The investigation team, and us too, we'll do everything we can to help you\.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan's right\! We'll look and see if there's some way to stop this too\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Thanks, Kanami, Juujou-san\.  
**Hiyori:** Sure\.  
**Hiyori:** (But, if it comes down to it, I'll be the one to\.\.\.\)  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.It's nothing\. Anyway, we were in the middle of breakfast, weren't we?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Ah, my stomach started rumbling as soon as you said breakfast\.  
**Hiyori:** It's better if you can stay that relaxed for now\. I know it must be hard, but don't dwell on it too much\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Okay\.  
**Kanami:** So then, let's all have breakfast together\!  

## 7: Spreading Ripples
**Akane:** Now then, Maki-san, Yomi-san, Yume-san\. Please give your report on the Hitakami faction\.  
**Akane:** It was already reported to me that the Hitakami faction is attempting to produce "tamayori toji"; toji with aradama equipped to their bodies\.\.\.  
**Maki:** Yes, we engaged in combat with what we believe was a tamayori toji\. It didn't seem like they've perfected it, but it definitely raises a toji's overall capabilities\.  
**Maki:** It's just\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** What is it?  
**Yume:** It was like she'd turned into some kind of monster\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Excuse us\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.  
**Maki:** Setouchi Chie and Mashiko Kaoru?  
**Akane:** I called them here, thinking we would need information on Mokusa's side as well\.  
**Maki:** Do they know the situation?  
**Yukari:** We'll tell them what they need to know\.  
**Kaoru:** Tamayori toji\.\.\. Is it true they're doing experiments fusing aradama and toji?  
**Kaoru:** I'd heard the Hitakami faction was doing research on strengthening toji, but this tamayori thing\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Are Akira and them seriously doing that?  
**Maki:** It's the truth\.  
**Maki:** We personally fought with a toji we think was subjected to those experiments\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.  
**Chie:** And they tried forcing Mihono-chan\.\.\. Asakura Mihono to help with their research\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Why Mihono? Because of that power she got from Kashuu Kiyomitsu?  
**Maki:** That power of Asakura Mihono's\.\.\.?  
**Chie:** That's\.\.\.  
**Akane:** I'll tell them\.  
**Akane:** Asakura-san's power stems from the great aradama, Kanayamahime\. As it goes, the great aradama Kanayamahime has been passed down for generations through the eldest daughters of the Asakura family\.  
**Maki:** A great aradama\!?  
**Yume:** You mean, like Tagitsuhime?  
**Yukari:** That's correct\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.  
**Maki:** I propose having Asakura Mihono give up her okatana\.  
**Maki:** We can't allow the Hitakami faction to have her either, so she'll need guards\.\.\. We can do that\.  
**Chie:** Wait\! You're saying you'll make Mihono-chan quit being a toji\!?  
**Maki:** That's right\. It's only a temporary measure, but, if this is as dangerous as with Tagitsuhime, it's something we'd better do\.  
**Chie:** That's going too far\!  
**Chie:** We already took into account the risk of her losing control and had her pulled off of any missions\!  
**Maki:** That's just turning a blind eye to the heart of the problem\. So long as there's a risk of the great aradama awakening, there's steps we need to take\.  
**Akane:** Please calm down, both of you\. As for what should be done with Asakura-san\.\.\. I will give you my answer on behalf of the Sword Administration Bureau\.  
**Akane:** Asakura Mihono will continue to be left with the investigation team\. However, the next time she shows signs of rampancy, we will immediately place her under confinement\.  
**Chie:** Confinement\.\.\.  
**Akane:** This is a government issued directive and will not be altered\.  

## 8: The Reason Behind Her Decision (1\)
**Akira:** I'm against this\. Let's stop the final experiments on tamayori toji\.  
**Makoto:** Akira-chan\.\.\.  
**Yuuki:** I want you to rethink this, Makoto-nee-sama\.  
**Makoto:** Yuuki-chan\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Having failed to win over Asakura Mihono, a descendant of the Atago family, I am the one left with the highest compatibility\.  
**Makoto:** As someone with blood ties to the Atago family, this is something I must do\.\.\. Please understand that\.  
**Akira:** We've already heard all that\.  
**Akira:** Anybody closest to the Atago family has the highest compatibility for tamayori\. That's why somebody from the Hitakamis like you has the best shot, right?  
**Akira:** But, since Yuuki and me are related to the Hitakamis, that means we should be plenty compatible\.  
**Akira:** Am I wrong?  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.  
**Akira:** This isn't something you can laugh off\!  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.We're serious about this\.  
**Yuuki:** Why can't you just tell us to be tamayori test subjects\! Please, Makoto-nee-sama\!  
**Yuuki:** All you have to do is say that, and we would gladly do it for you\!  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.  
**Makoto:** (That's the very reason I can't tell you that, Yuuki-chan\.\)  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.You know, don't you?  
**Makoto:** If someone incompatible is forced through the experiment, rather than equipping onto the body, the aradama becomes fused to the flesh\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Do you not get it yourself?  
**Akira:** If that's what'll happen to us, then an experiment with you is bound to fail too\.  
**Akira:** And, if there's a chance it'll work for you, then there's just as much a chance it'll work for us\!  
**Akira:** So let us do it\!  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Among the three of us, I am still the most compatible\. Which makes this something I need to do\.  
**Makoto:** (So another tragedy like that can never be repeated\.\.\.\)  

## 9: The Reason Behind Her Decision (2\)
--Five years ago\.

  
**Chie:** I didn't think we'd come under attack from aradama\.\.\.\.\.\. Captain\! Let's retreat for now and re-organize\!  
**Captain:** Don't lose your nerve, Setouchi\! We aren't retreating\.\.\. We can't retreat here\!  
**Chie:** But, with this many of them\!   
**Captain:** The head of the Origami family gave orders to recover noro without fail\!  
**Sasano Miyako:** The head of the Origami family, then\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Miyako\.\.\.  
**Miyako:** That puts us in a bind\.  
**Miyako:** She's normally more composed\.\.\. But she can't go against the head of the Origami family, can she\.  
**Chie:** Still, there's more of them than our unit can handle\.  
**Makoto:** Chie-san\.\.\. Miyako-san\.\.\.  
**Miyako:** You don't have to look so worried\. I'll get you through this, Makoto\.  
**Makoto:** I-I'll be fine\! I'm a toji myself\!  
**Miyako:** And I feel better having you here\.  
**Miyako:** \.\.\.Chie, keep an eye on the captain\.  
**Chie:** I will\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Makoto\.  
**Makoto:** Yes\!  
**Chie:** Be careful not to get separated from Miyako\.\.\. Once we're home safe, we can wind down with a nice long bath\.  
**Miyako:** That's a death flag, you know?  
**Miyako:** \.\.\.Look after yourself, Chie\.  
**Chie:** You too\.  
**Makoto:** MIYAKO-SAN\! MIYAKO-SAN\!\!  
**Miyako:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** The bleeding won't stop\.\.\. Why did, we even take this mission\.\.\.  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Makoto:** Gh\!  
**Makoto:** LEAVE US ALONE\!  
**Makoto:** If\.\.\. If Miyako-san isn't treated soon\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUGHHHHHH\!\!  
**Makoto:** Over at last\.\.\. Miyako-san, I have to\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Ngh, my vision's fading\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** I can't, faint here\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Need to take Miyako-san\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Miyako\! Makoto\! Where are you\!?  
Chie --\!\!

  
**Chie:** G-Get a medical team right away\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** (Chie-san's voice\.\.\.? Thank God\.\.\. Miyako-san\.\.\.\)  

## 10: The Reason Behind Her Decision (3\)
**Miyako:** You don't need to come and visit me this often, Makoto\.  
**Makoto:** But\.\.\. it's because of me\.\.\. If I had been stronger\.\.\.  
**Miyako:** If you hadn't been there, I would have died\. No one is blaming you; I'm grateful for what you did\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.  
**Miyako:** \.\.\.Really\. Chie, won't you say something to her too?  
**Chie:** I've been telling her\. But\.\.\. you see\.  
**Miyako:** \.\.\.I guess she can't help it\.  
**Miyako:** Makoto\.  
**Makoto:** Y-Yes\!  
**Miyako:** I'm feeling a little thirsty\. Sorry, but could you go buy me something to drink?  
**Makoto:** Right; I'll buy you something right away\!  
**Chie:** Aren't there drinks in the fridge here? \.\.\.Was there something that's difficult to say with Makoto in the room?  
**Miyako:** Yeah\. It'd be better if she didn't hear about this for now\.  
**Miyako:** \.\.\.It looks like this is it for me\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.\!\!  
**Chie:** Isn't there something they can do\.\.\.?  
**Miyako:** My right eye, I can hardly see with it\. I can tell whether it's bright or dark, but that's it\.  
**Miyako:** And\.\.\. Mm\.\.\. I can't move my left arm\. When something touches it too\.\.\. I can't feel anything\.  
**Miyako:** It's like\.\.\. it's not even a part of me\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Miyako\.\.\.  
**Miyako:** Sorry\.\.\. We won't be fighting together anymore\.  
**Chie:** Why\.\.\. are you the one apologizing\.\.\.  
**Miyako:** You were doing so well holding it in\.\.\. Don't cry now\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Miyako-san won't be a toji anymore\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** This is my fault\.\.\. Because of me\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** If I\.\.\. had been stronger\.\.\. No\.\.\. that's not enough\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** If toji\.\.\. could be stronger\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** At that time, I realized it\.  
**Makoto:** The ideology Mother promoted, of strengthening toji and reducing the number who fell victim to aradama, was by no means wrong\.  
**Akira/Yuuki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** In the beginning, even though it was called the desire of the Hitakami faction, I never felt it for myself\.  
**Makoto:** But, after what happened then\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** I understood Mother's grief\.\.\. Having lost so many of her friends at the Great Disaster of Sagami Bay\. The injuries she suffered there leaving her with no choice but to give up her life as a toji\.  
**Makoto:** I would make sure that Mother's\.\.\. and my desire became a reality\.  

## 11: As the Family Head (1\)
**Makoto:** I would make sure that Mother's\.\.\. and my desire became a reality\.  
**Akira:** You're just jumbling things up and spouting off excuses\.\.\. That's not you\!  
**Makoto:** Eh?  
**Akira:** I'm sayin', the choice you're making here, nothing about it sounds like something you'd do, Makocchan\!  
**Akira:** You'd know this better than anybody\. The head does what the head does, and the hands've got their own part to play\.  
**Akira:** You're the head here\!  
**Akira:** If the head gives out, we're done for\.  
**Akira:** Not to doubt the people giving us this tech, but don't take any chances\!  
**Akira:** That's how we've done things, right\!?  
**Makoto:** Then, you'll be the one to\.\.\. Is that it?  
**Akira:** See, you do get it\. That's what makes sense\.  
**Yuuki:** That's no fair, Akira-nee-sama\.  
**Yuuki:** We were both convincing her, so why are you taking the best part for yourself in the end\!  
**Akira:** It's cause it's the best part that I want it all for me\.  
**Akira:** Figure that out, dummy\.  
**Yuuki:** I don't like that\!  
**Yuuki:** If you're getting into the good stuff, I want you to share it with me too\. That's how\.\.\. we've done things\.  
**Akira:** No big sister's gonna force their little sister into something crazy\. Could you just let me look good here?  
**Yuuki:** But little sisters try to be like their big sister\. We're ride or die\.  
**Akira:** Don't go trying to make yourself sound slick\. I bet you just picked that one up anyway\.\.\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Do you really get it? You're riskin' more than me with this\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akira:** What happens if yours is the only one that screws up?  
**Yuuki:** I don't care\.   
**Akira:** Quit acting like you're tough\. Care some\.  
**Yuuki:** I don't care\!  
**Yuuki:** Because, even if my experiment fails, Makoto-nee-sama won't leave me like that, will she?  
**Makoto:** You know that I wouldn't\. Whatever it took, I would help you\.  
**Yuuki:** See\. Makoto-nee-sama can take care of that\.  
**Yuuki:** But\.\.\. Akira-nee-sama I wouldn't be able to\. Am I wrong?  
**Makoto:** Ah\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Not wrong at all\. Yeah, you hit the nail on the head\.  
**Akira:** Don't go crying if yours fails, alright?  
**Yuuki:** I won't\!   
**Akira:** Sorry, but we've made up our minds\.  
**Akira:** You're a real softie, Makocchan\. Deep down, you'd never want to use us for this\.\.\. or anybody really\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.You're right\. I thought, if the experiment could succeed with me\.\.\. that would be the best approach\.  
**Akira:** But we don't want that\. Let us off for being selfish on this\.  
**Yuuki:** We're sorry about this, Makoto-nee-sama\!  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.Apologizing doesn't make it bother me any less\.  
**Akira:**  Well, if we screw up, just put that towards the next experiment\.  
**Akira:** Then it works out fine\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.You sure are pushy\. But, I really will do that, alright?  
**Makoto:** There's lots of things that are going to hurt, you know?  
**Yuuki:** So long as you're the one doing them, I don't mind\!  
**Akira:** I'd be pissed if you didn't make good use of it\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.I've seen my own share of toji getting hurt, from place to place\. Even if I didn't know them, it's hard to stomach\.  
**Akira:** That's why I don't think a single thing wrong with what you believe in, Makocchan\.  
**Makoto:** Akira-chan\.\.\. Do you feel that way too, Yuuki-chan\.\.\.?  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.I haven't ever experienced anything like the both of you have\.  
**Yuuki:** If I keep going as a toji, that might someday happen to me\.\.\. But, it hasn't yet\.  
**Yuuki:** So my reason is a little different from Akira-nee-sama's\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.  
**Yuuki:** I want to be useful\.  
**Yuuki:** I hate that I can't do anything for Makoto-nee-sama like this\. I hate that Akira-nee-sama is always the one protecting me\.  
**Yuuki:** I want you to depend on me too\. Please let me be there for you\.  
**Yuuki:** Let me protect you along with Akira-nee-sama\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Alright then\.  
**Makoto:** The test subjects will be altered to both Inago and Toribane\!  
**Makoto:** This experiment always comes accompanied by a risk of failure\! Though\.\.\. Even if this were to fail, I have no doubt a new future for toji will be waiting beyond your sacrifice\!  
**Makoto:** Until I reach that future\.\.\. I will never stop pressing forward\.  
**Akira:** Sure\!  
**Yuuki:** Right\!  

## 12: As the Family Head (2\)
**Makoto:** It seems it's going to take a little more time before the experiment is finished being adjusted for two people\.  
**Akira:** If we have time, that works for me\.  
**Akira:** So hey\.\.\. What's going to happen with Mihono?  
**Makoto:** Just as I told Asakura-san\. Her life won't be able to return to the way it was\.  
**Akira:** Yeah, that figures\.  
**Makoto:** Kanayamahime's existence will have been reported to the government\.  
**Makoto:** With the Year-End Disaster being fresh in their minds, they would harbor strong misgivings towards Asakura-san\.  
**Makoto:** I have no doubt they'll put her under confinement for one reason or another\. Though, I can't say for certain what will come after that\.\.\.  
**Akira:** That's fine; I get the idea\. They're just gonna sweep it under the rug, aren't they?  
**Yuuki:** \.\.\.I want to help out Mihono-san\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.I would too\. If she had come over to the Hitakami faction, we could have done something for her\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Along with that\.\.\. I have two concerns\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.There's more to this?  
**Makoto:** The officials who go against me\.\.\. They'll surely try to get Asakura-san for themselves\.  
**Yuuki:** They'd go and do that\.\.\.?  
**Makoto:** That's how much value Asakura-san\.\.\. her Atago blood carries\.  
**Makoto:** Thinking towards the future\.\.\. Asakura-san's assistance will be vital in curing the toji who have given themselves up to the tamayori experiments so far\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.What's the other thing on your mind?  
**Makoto:** Kanayamahime\.\.\. looks to be awakening faster than I'd assumed\.  
**Akira:** --\!  
**Akira:** Is that it\!? The reason you're pushing forward with the final experiments right now\!  
**Makoto:** It is; one of the main reasons\.  
**Makoto:** Should that time come, tamayori toji will be the ace up our sleeve\.  
**Akira:** So it's the power to kill Mihono\.  
**Makoto:** To harm others, regardless of her own intentions\.\.\. Do you think Asakura-san would be able to bear that?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.She wouldn't\.  
**Akira:** That's how Mihono is\.  
**Makoto:** With a tamayori toji's power, you could even defeat a great aradama\. I'd ask you to prove that by cutting down Asakura-san\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Alright\.  
**Yuuki:** Makoto-nee-sama\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.This is only in the worst case scenario\.  
**Makoto:** I would hope it doesn't come to that\.\.\.  
**Other:** Frustrating Days  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Mai\.  
**Mai:** What is it, Sayaka-chan?  
**Sayaka:** I heard\.\.\. about Mihono\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Oh\.  
**Sayaka:** Mihono, will she be okay?  
**Mai:** She has Setouchi-san and Kitora-san\.\.\. The whole investigation team is trying everything they can for her, so I'm sure she'll be fine\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.It's frustrating not being able to do anything, isn't it\.  
**Sayaka:** Cookies\.\.\.  
**Mai:** ?  
**Mai:** Are you feeling hungry?  
**Sayaka:** That's not it\.  
**Sayaka:** I want to make cookies to give to Mihono\. It would make her feel better\.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan\.\.\.  
**Mai:** You're right\. Then, how about we make them together?  
**Sayaka:** Okay\.
