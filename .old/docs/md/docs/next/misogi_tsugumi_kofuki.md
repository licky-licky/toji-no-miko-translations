## [Misogi - Tsugumi: Start\]: Chasing the Mysteries of Aradama
**Tsugumi:** [sippp, sippp\.\.\. slurrrp\.\.\.\]  
**Tsugumi:** Mmm, this is no good\.  
**Kofuki:** Oh, you finally realized how bad that stuff is? Even if it's nutritious, it tastes like crap\.  
**Tsugumi:** Hm? What are you talking about? These packs are great tasting and perfectly nutritious; the complete portable meal\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Huh? Wait, so what's no good then?  
**Tsugumi:** The fact that I've been ignoring a possibility up until now, is all\.  
**Tsugumi:** I realized something\. Haven't there been an awful lot of cases of aradama stealing things recently?  
**Tsugumi:** And, from a possibility in that\.\.\. I've formed a hypothesis\!  
**Kofuki:** Ooh, some new way to run into tons of aradama-chan\!?  
**Tsugumi:** Which is, is it possible that, when a subset of aradama steal objects from humans, they're wanting human attention?  
**Tsugumi:** Even when aradama steal objects, I don't believe they use them in any way\.  
**Tsugumi:** What do you think, Shichinosato-san? About my "attention seeking aradama" theory\!  
**Kofuki:** You're looking all smug about it\.\.\. but I really don't care\.  
**Tsugumi:** Ehh, but don't you think it's extraordinarily bad that something this vital was overlooked until now-?  
**Kofuki:** I said I don't care\! Did you call me here just to tell me that\.\.\.?  
**Tsugumi:** I'd like your help in collecting data on aradama, the same as usual-\.  
**Tsugumi:** To test my earlier theory, I think we'll need a certain amount of concrete data as proof-- for example, what do they actually steal?  
**Kofuki:** So you're saying I'll get to play with loads of aradama-chan\!  
**Tsugumi:** Yes, though, the thing is\.\.\. For this assignment, I'll need you to fight without bringing the aradama down right away, while limiting damage to the surroundings as much as possible\.  
**Tsugumi:** Because the primary goal of this is observation, not defeating the aradama\. Can you work around that?  
**Kofuki:** Hell no\! Why do I gotta sit around waiting in a fight?  
**Tsugumi:** If you hold yourself back a little, won't it feel 2-3 times more enjoyable when you do defeat the aradama?  
**Kofuki:** Yeah right\. Call me up when you're done with this watch-'n-wait borefest\.  
**Tsugumi:** Hmm, her reaction was within expectations\. Though, collecting data on my own\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** The best case would be to find someone who might have a different sort of interest in aradama than Shichinosato-san\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** \!  
**Ellen:** So that's why you gave me a call then, Tsugumin\!  
**Tsugumi:** Yes, because of your personal views on aradama\. I was sure you would be interested\.  
**Ellen:** Yes\! This theory that aradama are stealing things because they want attention from people, it's very interesting\!  
**Ellen:** I think it sounds plausible too\.  
**Tsugumi:** If my hypothesis is correct, and there are aradama with the nature to seek out humans of their own accord, it may even be possible for some to be tamed as pets\.  
**Ellen:** That's right\. It'd be wonderful if it could be more common for aradama to have relationships like Kaoru and Nene do\.  
**Ellen:** I'll help you with this, Tsugumin\. Do you have any ideas where there might be aradama looking for attention?  
**Tsugumi:** I've already taken care of researching that\. So then, shall we go-?  
**Ellen:** Let's go\!  

## [Misogi - Tsugumi: End\]: Trial and Error Towards a Dream
**Tsugumi:** From what a local farmer said, there are frequent cases of aradama stealing their crops\.  
**Ellen:** There don't seem to be any attacks on people either\. The theory's sounding more and more credible\!  
**Tsugumi:** Yes\. It's considered impossible for aradama to grow accustomed to humans, but this shows promise, doesn't it-\. I'm feeling inspired now-\.  
**Ellen:** Take a look at the lettuce scattered around here\! It couldn't have happened naturally, and there's no signs of it being eaten\!  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** This looks to be a bingo, fufu\.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, you know, these aradama stealing crops and running off into the mountains are somewhat like monkeys, aren't they-\.  
**Ellen:** Like monkeys, we might be able to get along with them\! Rather than a troupe of apes, it's a troupe of aradama\!  
**Tsugumi:** Gathering data here is a step towards that\.  
**Tsugumi:** If we can find something resembling an aradama nest here, we can investigate whether they've collected man-made objects and so on\.\.\. Though maybe I'm hoping for too much just yet\.  
**Ellen:** We'll just have to pray we get lucky\~\.  
**Ellen:** Let's close the distance quick so they won't escape, and get some data while we're at it\!  
**Tsugumi:** Woo-\!  
**Tsugumi:** That's how excited I am now, to shout that-\.  
**Ellen:** It looks like there's stuff besides stolen crops littered around\.  
**Tsugumi:** From what we've confirmed from missions so far, aside from sometimes stealing food, they also steal a variety of things, from items that cover daily needs to objects made of processed metals\.  
**Ellen:** We can't be sure the aradama are responsible for all of this, and I don't see any rhyme or reason behind it, but couldn't this be enough to say aradama are interested in humans, in a way?  
**Tsugumi:** I think it's plenty of basis to do a practical test of our hypothesis with that aradama\.  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Alright, let's get closer\. If the theory holds up, so long as we don't attack, it should be fine\.  
**Ellen:** Come on, let's be friends\!  
**Tsugumi:** There's nothing to be afraid of-\.  
**Ellen:** We can get along with Nene, so surely other aradama can do it too\.\.\.  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Aradama:** KSHAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Tsugumi:** \.\.\.So this was no good\.  
**Ellen:** That was even more shocking than getting attacked by aradama usually is\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** If more of them are coming out, we can't give up hope just yet\!  
**Aradama:** GUGGGGIII\.\.\.\!  
**Ellen:** That was exhausting\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** They were all duds\. I wonder if this hypothesis was incorrect\.\.\. Either way, Kohagura-san\. Thank you very much for joining me here\.  
**Ellen:** I had fun too, so it's no problem\!  
**Tsugumi:** That's good then\. Still, for what reason do aradama steal objects-? Causing that much disturbance will mean toji are sent to exorcise them\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Ah\.\.\.\! It couldn't be that they're doing things to draw attention so that they can be exorcised, is it\.\.\.?  
**Tsugumi:** Mmmghh\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** You sure are dedicated to this, Tsugumin\. What are you hoping to do by learning so much about aradama?  
**Tsugumi:** I want to find peaceful uses for aradama\.\.\. Achieving some form of coexistence is my dream\. It might be little more than a fantasy of mine now, but I'm serious about it-\.  
**Ellen:** Oh\! Tsugumin\! Your dream is the same as mine\! We're like-minded comrades\!  
**Tsugumi:** Well now-\. That's a pleasant surprise-\.  
**Tsugumi:** I'd like to ask if we could share more information from now on, if that's alright with you, Kohagura-san\.  
**Ellen:** Of course it is\!  
**Tsugumi:** Good, this should help me make progress in data gathering\. Now then, on the way back, how about we discuss my idea from earlier-?  
(best quality I could find it for now\)

## [Misogi - Kofuki: Start\]:
**Tsugumi:** \.\.\.Let's put an end to things here for today\. Good work, Shichinosato-san\.  
**Kofuki:** What, done already?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes, this is plenty for today\. \.\.\.Here, have some hot milk\.  
**Kofuki:** You didn't put anything weird in it, right?  
**Tsugumi:** Of course not\.  
**Kofuki:** Thanks for that\.\.\. Oww, hot\! Let it cool down some first\!  
**Tsugumi:** Huh, had it not cooled off enough yet? I'm sorry\.  
**Kofuki:** Damnit\.\.\. [blow- blow-\]\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Oh yeah, get this\! Earlier, Mihocchi went and ate my milk pudding, y'know\!?  
**Tsugumi:** That sounds like fun\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Huh? You even listening? What part about getting your pudding eaten sounds fun to you\!  
**Tsugumi:** Well\.\.\. You've been sounding like you're enjoying yourself this whole time, Shichinosato-san\.  
**Kofuki:** I mean, it's not like I can be in a bad mood all day, right?  
**Tsugumi:** You might be right\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Now it just sounds like you're trying to get off the subject\.  
**Kofuki:** Though, I guess it has been pretty fun and stuff lately\.  
**Tsugumi:** See, isn't that what I was telling you?  
**Kofuki:** Don't give me that\! Nobody's gonna come back with "Yeah, it was fun," after they tell you about how they got their milk pudding stolen\!  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.And that's what she said, but, what do you think?  
**Mirja:** This isn't the sort of conversation we should have in the middle of a mission, is it\.  
**Kofuki:** It's not like we're finding any aradama-chan, so just loosen up\.  
**Mihono:** I thought I bought you another milk pudding though\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** No duh? Like I was gonna let you off eating it like that\. But still, what do you think, Mihocchi?  
**Mihono:** What do you mean, what do I think\.\.\.? She said you sounded like you were having fun, right?  
**Mihono:** If you're having fun, then isn't that all good?  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, I guess, but still, it kinda rubs me the wrong way somehow\.  
**Mirja:** I believe that's not the point Ban Tsugumi was trying to get across, but that you've changed, Shichinosato Kofuki\.  
**Kofuki:** Huh? I haven't changed a bit\. It's not like, back then, I never had fun when I wasn't playing with aradama-chan or anything\.  
**Mihono:** I think you've changed a lot though? Like, when we first met, Kiyoka always stayed away from you, but it's not like that anymore, right?  
**Kofuki:** I mean, you say that, but\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Have I really changed?  

## [Misogi - Kofuki: End\]:
**Kofuki:** I'm here-\.  
**Tsugumi:** Oh, you seem to be in a bad mood today\.  
**Tsugumi:** Did Asakura-san take your milk pudding again\.\.\. No, you didn't get enough sleep, did you\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.How'd you know that?  
**Tsugumi:** You have bags under your eyes\. It would be obvious to anyone\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Tch, you're too damn quick on the uptake\.  
**Tsugumi:** So, why weren't you getting enough sleep? Were you\.\.\. No, you don't read books, do you?  
**Kofuki:** Don't go deciding that on your own\!  
**Kofuki:** And anyway, it's all your fault\!\!  
**Tsugumi:** Hm? It's\.\.\. my fault?  
**Kofuki:** Yeah it is\. Cause you went and said I looked like I was having fun, it turned into this argument about whether I'd changed or not, and I felt too messed up to get any sleep\.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm having a hard time following, but\.\.\. After I said you seemed to be enjoying yourself, you spoke to it with the investigation team, and they came to the conclusion that you've changed?  
**Tsugumi:** \.\.\.Is that how it happened?  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.You got it\.  
**Tsugumi:** If you were that worried about something like that, then you really have changed, Shichinosato-san\.  
**Kofuki:** So what\.\.\. You think I've changed too?  
**Tsugumi:** I do\.  
**Tsugumi:** Of course you would change\. Everyone is affected by the people around them\.  
**Tsugumi:** Even I've changed after becoming involved with the investigation team, wouldn't you agree?  
**Kofuki:** I guess\.\.\. Actually, did you change? Sorry, I don't really remember\.  
**Tsugumi:** \.\.\.Fufufu\.  
**Tsugumi:** It seems that the old Shichinosato-san really didn't think about anything besides aradama\.  
**Kofuki:** Well duh, wasn't that obvious?  
**Tsugumi:** (On top of that, when everyone around you are people like me\.\.\. It's only natural that it would change you\.\)  
**Tsugumi:** Though, whether or not you change, you'll still be Shichinosato-san\.  
**Tsugumi:** I don't think you need to think so deeply about it\.  
**Kofuki:** You get real annoying when you're explaining stuff, y'know\. Like, you're probably thinking you can spin me whatever bullshit, but I'm not letting you outta this one\.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm at a loss then\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** (I want to tell her that I think she's more lively before, and that she doesn't have to worry about unnecessary things, but\.\.\. how would I get that across?\)  
**Kofuki:** Is that some aradama-chan\!?  
**Tsugumi:** Good timing\.  
**Tsugumi:** You do seem to be having the most fun whenever aradama appear\. That part of you really doesn't change\.  
**Kofuki:** 'Course it wouldn't\! Anyway, I'm gonna go check it out\!  
**Tsugumi:** I'll be waiting for you to bring me back data as a souvenir\.  
**Kofuki:** Sure, count on it\!
