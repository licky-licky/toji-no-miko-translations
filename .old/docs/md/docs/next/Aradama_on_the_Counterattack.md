Aradama on the Counterattack - Prologue

  
**Mihono:** Look, look, Fukki\! There's a whole bunch of the enemies we've fought so far\!  
**Mihono:** It's almost like a carnival\!  
**Kofuki:** Right, Mihocchi? You could chop till you drop\!  
**Kofuki:** Which should I go with first\.\.\. Kai? Nah, Suruga could work too\.  
**Kaoru:** The only carnival here is what went wrong in your heads\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** I mean, Tagitsuhime's over there with the eternally flat chested woman; the setting's falling apart here\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Juujou-san can really pull off that boss fight feeling, can't she\!  
**Kaoru:** Try to follow what I'm saying-\. Damnit, leave the boss rushes to video games-\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** What're you whining about?  
**Kofuki:** Look at all the aradama-chan we get to play with\! Who cares about games or whatever\!  
**Kaoru:** Oi\.\.\. Even joking about it, these are all tough enemies we fought do or die style, see? Are we really\.\.\. fine with this? Like, emotionally, this is what we're going with??  
**Mihono:** Come on, Kaoru-san\. Don't bring up the difficult stuff and let's do our best together\! Where there's a will, there's a way\! Right\!  
**Kaoru:** Aghh-\.\.\. I don't want to be hereee\.  
Aradama on the Counterattack - Epilogue

  
**Tsugumi:** The VR practice exercise has been completed\. Good work, everyone\.  
**Tsugumi:** Thanks to you all, I was able to get some great data\.  
**Kofuki:** Phew, all my playing around pays off\! You'd better let me back in there from time to time\!  
**Tsugumi:** Of course, I'll consider it\.  
**Kofuki:** Sure; counting on you\!  
**Kaoru:** Ughh, I can't believe I got dragged along with this joke\. Ahh-, I'm beat\.  
**Ellen:** You say that, but it looks you got a pretty high score, didn't you?  
**Kaoru:** That's only cause Hiyori kept focusing me for some reason\.  
**Kaoru:** Is her programming bugged or something?  
**Tsugumi:** That shouldn't be a bug\.\.\. It may have been a response to you calling her eternally flat chested\.  
**Kaoru:** That effects her even in her programming\.\.\. Hiyori\.\.\. You're really something\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** I know just the thing; mind if I mess with part of Hiyori's data? At least with her data, I can make her dreams come true\!  
**Tsugumi:** If that's what you want, Mashiko-san, I won't stop you\.\.\. Ahh, you don't need to report which parts of the data you changed either\.  
**Ellen:** Tsugumin, Tsugumin\! I want to try this training too\!  
**Ellen:** Can't I?  
**Tsugumi:** Of course; it would mean fresh data for me, so it would be a big help\.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, the difficulty for this practice exercise was tuned for three people: Mashiko-san, Shichinosato-san, and Asakura-san\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Got it\! Then, I'll wait for the difficulty to be tuned again\!  
**Kofuki:** Wait, wait\! If you're doing it again, let me in too\!  
**Mihono:** If Fukki's doing it, then I wanna go too\!  
**Tsugumi:** It's that popular, I see\. What about you, Mashiko-san?  
**Kaoru:** Of course I'm gonna pass\.  
**Tsugumi:** Then, please wait a moment while I adjust the difficulty settings\.  
**Ellen:** Okay\! I can't wait\!  
**Kofuki:** Mihocchi, how bout we compete to see who can cut up the most aradama-chan?  
**Mihono:** Sure\! This carnival's going to keep on going\!
