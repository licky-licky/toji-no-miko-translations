## [Misogi - Mirja: Start\]: Fix Eyes on the Sword
**Mirja:** (This happened when I was still part of Ayanokouji Martial Arts School's middle school division-- That is to say, several years ago\.\)  
**Mirja:** (As my grandfather and father, both swordsmiths, shared with me their skills in polishing swords, I polished one Akabane sword\.\)  
**Mirja:** (What I honed then is the okatana I have with me now: Jikkyuu Mitsutada\.\)  
**Mirja:** (I was taken down the path of a toji because of the compatibility I showed with an okatana I myself restored\. I'm still proud of that to this day\.\)  
**Mirja:** HAAAH\!  
**Senpai Toji:** \.\.\.Wha-\!? Y-You got me\.\.\.\!  
**Mirja:** Thank you very much for joining me here\.  
**Senpai Toji:** Mann, you're seriously strong, Kitora\. No wonder you got picked to represent us at the tournament\.  
**Senpai Toji:** I won't be able to go and cheer you on, but give it your best shot there\.  
**Mirja:** I will\. As one of the selected representatives, I plan to do my best not to dishonor Ayanokouji's reputation\.  
**Senpai Toji:** Fufu, you're sure taking this seriously\.  
**Mirja:** (Then, in the preliminary round, came my match against Shidou Maki\. Even now, I can remember that moment vividly\.\)  
**Maki:** HAAAAAAAAAAHH\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Gggh\!  
**Referee:** That's enough\! The winner: Heijou Academy's Shidou Maki\.  
**Mirja:** (Then, I wasn't good enough to reach the finals? Her swordsmanship, it was so straightforward\. Each and every strike, so strong, so heavy, so much more than I could handle\.\.\.\)  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.  
**Mirja:** (Shidou Maki\.\.\. I understood that there would always be someone better, but\.\.\. All I can do is make use of this to train myself up again\.\)  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Aradama:** GGGGIIii\.\.\.\!  
**Senpai Toji:** Kitora\! The aradama's headed your way\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.\!?  
**Mirja:** (\.\.\.Was I really that absent minded during a mission?\)  
**Mirja:** Understood\.\.\. I'll deal with it now\!  
**Mirja:** I won't let it escape\! --HAAAAAAH\!\!  
**Mirja:** What about the other aradama?  
**Senpai Toji:** The one you got now was the last of them\.  
**Mirja:** It was? Then, we need to recover the noro\. I'll help you\.  
**Kouhai Toji:** Kitora-senpai\.\.\. Did something happen to her?  
**Senpai Toji:** Hmm\.\.\. Ever since the tournament, it's like her head's up in the clouds sometimes\.\.\. I'm a little worried about her\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** (As always\.\.\. being alone performing maintenance on an okatana gives me the best chance to examine myself\.\)  
**Mirja:** (I'm only mindlessly working my hands, and yet Jikkyu Mitsutada is showing me things I wouldn't ordinarily notice\.\.\. That's the feeling I get\.\)  
**Mirja:** Still, to make both my senpai and kouhai worried\.\.\. How pathetic of me\.  
**Mirja:** It seems that\.\.\. It's strange to admit, but losing to Shidou Maki must have been somewhat of a shock to me\.\.\. I think\.  
**Mirja:** I wasn't conceited, but challenging her with everything I had and losing is frustrating\.\.\. Faced with her sword, I was shown the true extent of her strength\. And, that might not be something I can reach with just my swordsmanship\.  
**Mirja:** It's not that I have any intention of neglecting my training, but\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** As a toji, what sort of path should I explore from here?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Heh\. Jikkyuu Mitsutada isn't going to tell me that much, is it\.  

## [Misogi - Mirja: Start\]: What Must Be Polished is You Yourself
**Mirja:** We'll be in trouble if it comes out from blind spots behind the trees\!  
**Mirja:** Let's move out into the open and engage from there\. Fortunately, the aradama appears to be pursuing us\.  
**Mirja:** (I won't show as shameful a performance as last time\. I'm focused\.\)  
**Senpai Toji:** I'm not happy about that one bit though\.\.\.  
**Senpai Toji:** But, it'll be easier fighting like Kitora said\. Let's go\!  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\!  
**Mirja:** It's moving as anticipated\. Now, let's make our move\.  
**Kouhai Toji:** U-Um\! Is it really alright for me to be the one finishing it off\.\.\.?  
**Kouhai Toji:** I think one of you senpais should do it\.  
**Mirja:** No, the two of us will halt its movements\. At that point, please come at it from behind\.  
**Mirja:** If you're unable to bring it down, we'll immediately go on the attack\.  
**Senpai Toji:** The way things are, that seems like the least risky way to beat it\.  
**Kouhai Toji:** Alright then\.\.\.\!  
**Mirja:** Have confidence in yourself\. --Here it comes\!  
**Aradama:** SHAAaaaa\.\.\.\!  
**Mirja:** I'm sorry to have made the both of you worry about me on our last mission\.  
**Senpai Toji:** It's all good\. You were more clear headed than usual today anyway\. It helped see the fight from a different perspective\.  
**Senpai Toji:** Some girls get so focused on the fighting they lose sight of what's around them\.  
**Kouhai Toji:** I also had a valuable experience here thanks to you, Kitora-senpai\! I feel a little more confident now\.  
**Mirja:** It's all because I had your cooperation\. A toji's duty is to exorcise aradama and protect the people\. Toji should combine their strengths\.  
**Mirja:** I recognized that once again here\.  
**Mirja:** (I don't necessarily need to bring about overwhelming results with my swordsmanship\. What's important is that we accomplish our duties more safely\.\)  
**Mirja:** (Studying more into tactics for battle and managing a unit will surely be useful to me\.\)  
**Senpai Toji:** You look kinda like you got a weight off your shoulders there, Kitora\.  
**Mirja:** Yes; because I've found a direction to go in\.  
**Mirja:** (When I participated in the tournament in my third year of middle school\.\.\. and, the missions that came shortly after\. I believe it was a good opportunity for me\.\)  
**Uraga Nao:** Hey, Mirja\~? You listening\~?  
**Mirja:** I am listening\. As you two groan on about your post-high school graduation career paths\.  
**Nao:** They make it sound like checking our career paths is no big deal, but this is tough\~\. They tell you to write down schools of choice too, if you're going on to university\.  
**Mizushina Kinuka:** Ah\! Maybe I should write down Ayanokouji Martial Arts School as my school of choice\. The best way to keep an eye on my little sister would be to get re-enrolled here-\.  
**Mirja:** The teacher is going to think you're making a joke\. And, how would your sister feel, having her older sister as her kouhai now?  
**Kinuka:** She'd be delighted, wouldn't she\!  
**Mirja:** Sigh\.\.\. You too, Uraga Nao; why not work backwards and narrow down which faculty to pursue from your future dreams and goals?  
**Nao:** Ughh\.\.\. I don't want to hear you using logic on me now\. What about you, Mirja? Are you already thinking about your career path and everything\~?  
**Mirja:** I'm thinking of becoming an okatana polisher, once I lose my powers as a toji\. Though, it's only one possibility\.  
**Kinuka:** Your family are swordsmiths\.\.\. they're polishers, right? And can't you do it yourself too, Kitora-san?  
**Mirja:** I can\. Even now, I keep in practice enough to not lose my skill\. When I want to think something over, I feel like doing it while polishing an okatana\.  
**Mirja:** Of course, I also check with professionals from time to time\.  
**Nao:** Mirja, you're totally okatana crazy\~\.  
**Kinuka:** Well, that's nothing new\.  
**Mirja:** I would like to continue polishing Akabane swords in the future\.  
**Mirja:** By polishing and restoring Akabane swords, it might lead to a rise in the number of toji accepted by okatana\. That's something I want to help with\.  
**Nao:** Oh gosh\.\.\. she has such a serious and well defined goal\~\.\.\.  
**Kinuka:** That sounds like something the teachers would take, no questions asked\. But, wait, why have you been thinking this out more than us third years-\!?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.That's something I should be asking, as your kouhai\. You should think more carefully about this, you two\.
