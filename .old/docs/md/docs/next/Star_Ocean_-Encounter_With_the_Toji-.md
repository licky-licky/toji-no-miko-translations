## -2: Encounter With the Aradama
**Reimi Saionji:** YAH\.\.\.\!  
**Reimi:** If this isn't working either\.\.\.\!  
**Rena Lanford:** Reimi-san\! I'll push up front\! Please use that chance to retreat\!  
**Reimi:** Alright\! I'm counting on you, Rena\!  
**Rena:** Right\! YAAAAAAAAAAAAH\!\!  
**Millie Chliette:** The aradama's staggered\! Let's run while we can\!\!  
**Reimi:** \.\.\.Phew, after that much running, we should be safe for now\.  
**Rena:** It doesn't seem as if we'll be able to beat aradama without a toji after all\.  
**Millie:** Rena, what'd I tell you\! You're talking all formal again\!  
**Millie:** We're all on the same team, so didn't we say you don't have to be so polite?  
**Rena:** Ah\.\.\.  
**Rena:** I get that, I just can't help it\.  
**Reimi:** It's not worth making that big a deal of either, Millie\.  
**Reimi:** Anyway, let's get back to everybody\. We'll have to think up a plan for dealing with aradama\.  
**Rena:** We need some kind of strategy, don't we\.  
**Millie:** A strategy? The fastest way would be getting some toji to help us\.  
**Reimi:** That's true\. To carry out what we're after, we're definitely going to need a toji's help at some point\.

## -1: Sci-Fi Technology
**Maria Traydor:** Reimi got in touch\. Like we expected, it doesn't seem they were able to defeat an aradama\.  
**Miki Sauvester:** Well shoot, so they really couldn't beat it? Hmmm, so that means, we're in trouble here\.\.\. aren't we\.  
**Maria:** We are\. It's impossible for us to resolve this on our own\. But, we aren't entirely without options\.  
**Miki:** You mean, how you said we could borrow help from a toji?  
**Maria:** That's right, from toji\.  
**Welch Vinyard:** Fidget, fidget\.\.\.  
**Miki:** W-Welch\.\.\.?  
**Welch:** Aghhh, I want to hurry and work our way in with the toji so I can see storm armor up close and personallll\!\!  
**Welch:** That stuff has to be that crazy sci-fi technology kinda thing, right\!?  
**Welch:** As an item creator, there's no way I can pass it up\!  
**Welch:** You think they'd notice if we swiped just one of 'em\~? Just whisk it away and start taking it apartttt\.\.\.\!\!  
**Maria:** \.\.\.Sigh\.  
**Maria:** Forget about that and take a look at this\.  
**Miki:** It's\.\.\. a picture of a girl?  
**Maria:** The toji, Ban Tsugumi\.  
**Maria:** And this next\. The contents of Ban Tsugumi's current research\.  
**Welch:** Hmhmm\~, I see, I see\. So basically, we make contact and get in good with her, yes?  
**Maria:** That's the plan\.  
**Miki:** That's fine and all, but\.\.\. Maria-san? Where'd you get all this info?  
**Maria:** That's not something you should worry about\.  
**Miki:** Ehh\!? That just makes me worried\!\!  
**Maria:** Now's not the time to be talking about this, is it?  
**Welch:** Maria's got the right idea\! Okayyy, we meet up with Reimi and them, then it's off to meet Ban Tsugumi\!  

## 1: Tsugumi's Assistants
**Yukari:** I see you're here, Asakura, Yanase\.  
**Mihono/Mai:** Yes ma'am\!  
**Yukari:** Ordinarily, Akane would be the one to tell you this, but she can't make time\. I'll be the one reporting to you instead\.  
**Yukari:** I'd like for the two of you to help at Ban's laboratory\.  
**Mai:** At\.\.\. Tsugumi-san's laboratory?  
**Mihono:** Ah, I know about this\! It's that thing she's been stuck up in her lab working on lately, right?  
**Mihono:** I think she said\.\.\. it's some kinda crazy research that could revolutionize a bunch of things like storm armor and stuff?  
**Yukari:** I've heard the same\.  
**Yukari:** However, at the current stage, we can't spare her too many people, so for now I'd like you two to go\.  
**Mihono/Mai:** Yes ma'am\!  
**Mihono:** So the stuff she's working on is actually pretty crazy\! I couldn't believe it\.  
**Mai:** Didn't you hear about it before, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, but, I mean, it's Tsugumi-san, y'know? I never really know how much to trust her\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Like, sometimes, you can't tell whether she's being serious or lying about something, right?  
**Mai:** You're right, she can be like that sometimes\.  
**Mihono:** But it looks like she was telling the truth here, so let's work real hard to help her out, Mai\!  
**Mai:** Sure thing, Mihono-chan\.  
**???:** Hah hah hah\! I'm glad you're here, assistants\! We've been waiting for you\!  
**Mihono:** Who's that\!?  
**Mai:** A friend of\.\.\. Tsugumi-san's?  
**???:** Of course they'd react like that\.\.\.  
**Miki Sauvester:** I'm Miki Sauvester\. I'm helping out Tsugumi\.  
**Miki:** And, this is\.\.\.  
**Welch Vinyard:** Likewise, helping out Tsugumi, the beautiful genius creator, Welch-chan at your service\! Looking forward to working with you, assistants\!  
**Mai:** You're helping her\.\.\.? I don't mean to pry, but, you aren't from the Sword Administration, are you? Could you tell us where you're associated with?  
**Welch:** What's any of that got to do with anything\!  
**Welch:** More importantly, you two have an impossibly important job getting the necessary items for Tsugumi's research\!  
**Welch:** So anyway, go on, get going and get them back\!\!  
**Mihono:** We got shooed out\.\.\. That person seemed really worked up about this\.\.\.  
**Mai:** That's for sure\.\.\. And, she didn't even tell us what it is we're supposed to get\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ah\.  
**Miki:** Oh, there you are\!  
**Mai:** Miki-san?  
**Miki:** Sorry about that, how she kicked you out and all\. Welch isn't such a bad girl, it's just\.\.\.  
**Miki:** Uh, could I ask for your names?  
**Mihono:** I'm Asakura Mihono\.  
**Mai:** And I'm Yanase Mai\.  
**Miki:** Mihono and Mai then\. I'll be helping you two out, so, I hope we can get along\!  

## 2: Ears and a Tail
**Mai:** Where are we heading?  
**Miki:** There's others besides Welch and me who are working with Tsugumi, so we're going to see them\.  
**Mihono:** Huh, what're they like?  
**Miki:** Well\.\.\.  
**???:** Ah, Rena\! Miki's here\!  
**???:** There she is\! Heeey, Miki\!  
**Miki:** Millie\! Rena-\!  
**Miki:** I'll introduce everybody; that's Millie and Rena\. And, these two are Asakura Mihono and Yanase Mai\.  
**Mihono/Mai:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Millie Chliette:** Hey, Miki? They look frozen stiff\.\.\.  
**Rena Lanford:** I think\.\.\. they're looking at my ears and Millie's tail?  
**Mihono:** Mai\! Millie-san's got a tail\!? And, Rena-san's ears, they're all long and pointy\!?  
**Mai:** I-I know\.\.\. That's not part of a costume, is it\.\.\.?  
**Millie:** They're all real\! Want to give it a touch?  
**Mihono:** Eh\!? Can I\!?  
**Millie:** Sure\!  
**Mihono:** It's so fluffy\.\.\.  
**Rena:** Uhh\.\.\. You want to touch mine too, Mai?  
**Mai:** Ah, then\.\.\. just a little bit\.  
**Mai:** (Oh, they twitched\.\.\. These ears really are real\.\.\.\)  
**Mai:** H-Hey, Mai\.\.\.? People don't grow tails, right\.\.\. Or those ears\.\.\.  
**Mai:** R-Right\.\.\.  
**Miki:** Millie, Rena, about that thing\.\.\.  
**Rena:** Ah\.\.\. Yeah\. It's over here\.  
**Aradama:** Gyou\~  
**Rena:** Ahaha, that tickles\.  
**Mihono:** That aradama's acting friendly with Rena-san\!?  
**Millie:** When we first found this aradama, it was really weakened\.  
**Millie:** Rena and I felt sorry for it, so we worked together to heal it\.\.\. And then, it kinda got attached to us\.  
**Mihono:** Normally, we should probably kill it, but\.\.\. Mai\.\.\. I don't think I want to kill this aradama\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.I know\. There's cases like Nene-chan, so, as long as it's not harming anyone, I don't think there's any need to suppress it\.\.\.  
**Aradama:** GyaA\!\!  
**Mai:** --\!\! Did it turn aggressive\!?  
**Mihono:** No, wait, Mai\.\.\. Behind you\!\!  
**Large Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Rena:** Watch out, Mai\! Kyah\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Thank you, Rena-san\! But, you're hurt\.\.\.  
**Miki:** Just let me take care of her injury\! Healing\!  
**Millie:** I'll back you up, so Mihono, Mai, take care of the aradama\!\! Delay\!\!  
**Mihono:** The aradama slowed down\.\.\. We can take it out while it's like this, Mai\!\!  
**Mai:** Right, Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono/Mai:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Large Aradama:** ooo\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Thanks for letting us know that aradama was there\.  
**Aradama:** Kyuo\~  
**Mai:** Now we should contact the Sword Administration Bureau and collect the noro\.\.\. Hm? What's this here?  
**Miki:** Ah-\! That's it\! That's the geregere slime we need for Tsugumi's research\!\!  

## 3: Welch's Identity
**Welch:** That's some geregere slime alright\! Nice going getting some so quick, assistants\!  
**Mai:** Geregere slime\.\.\. I've never seen or heard of that kind of material before\.\.\.  
**Welch:** Course not\! Of course not\! After all, it's a totally unknown material\!  
**Mihono:** If it's unknown, then how'd you know it's called geregere slime?  
**Welch:** Shaddup\! Even though we know what it's called, it's an unknown material, and it's absolutely needed for Tsugumi's experiment\!\!  
**Mihono:** Oh, okay\!  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Don't let her fool you, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mai:** Welch-san, are you really Tsugumi-san's assistant? We haven't seen Tsugumi around even once\.\.\.  
**Welch:** \.\.\.Seems like the cat's out of the bag now\.  
**Mihono:** Welch-san?  
**Mai:** \.\.\.  
**Welch:** That's right, I'm not Tsugumi's assistant or anything\.\.\.  
**Welch:** My true identity is, the one who hijacked this lab, the beautiful genius creator Welch-chan\!\! Hah hah hah\!  
**Tsugumi:** You look like you're enjoying yourself, Vinyard-san\.  
**Miki:** What are you up to, Welch?  
**Welch:** Wait, you're back already?  
**Miki:** "Already"? Weren't you the one who told me to call Tsugumi-san over?  
**Tsugumi:** Thank you for watching the lab while I was gone, Vinyard-san\. I got to have a nice break\.  
**Welch:** I could do this anytime\!  
**Welch:** Everything you're working on here's super interesting, so you have to make sure to take breaks so you can get on with the research\!  
**Mihono:** So wait, you were just messing with us?  
**Mihono:** Tsugumi-san and Welch-san have the same kind of energy\.\.\. Or, they seem like they really get along, don't they, Mai\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Mmhm\. It looks like I was worried for nothing\.  
**Mai:** Miki-san, there's still more geregere slime, isn't there? Let's go get it\.  
**Miki:** Sure\! Then, we're off again, Welch, Tsugumi\!  
**Tsugumi:** Now then, back to my research-\.  
**Welch:** Sure-\!  
**Tsugumi:** By the way, what exactly is geregere slime?  
**Welch:** Rather than talk about that, tell me more about noro\!  
**Tsugumi:** It doesn't seem like you're about to tell me, are you\. Oh well; what about noro would you like to know?  
**Tsugumi:** (\.\.\.Well, I suppose I can press her about geregere slime later\.\)  

## 4: Guns and Arrows
**Mihono:** Rena-san and Millie-san turned out to be nice people\!   
**Mai:** Mmhm, though I was a little surprised by their tail and ears\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** So Miki-san, do the people you're taking us to meet have tails too?  
**Miki:** Nope, the two we're going to see now don't have any tails\. But, they're wonderful people, so I'm sure\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Miki-san?  
**Miki:** U-Urgh\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** What's wrong\!?  
**Miki:** I'm hungry\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Eh? You're hungry\.\.\.?  
**Miki:** Come to think of it, I haven't gotten much to eat lately\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** D-Don't scare me like that\.\.\. I thought something bad happened to you\.  
**Miki:** Sorry about that\.\.\. But\.\.\. I think I might be too hungry to keep going\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Then, I'll go and buy something for you\. You stay with Miki-san, Mai\.  
**Mai:** Alright\!  
**Mihono:** I've got onigiri, and tea, and\.\.\. Okay, this should be enough\.  
**Mihono:** Better run back over to Mai and Miki-san\!  
**Mihono:** Aradama\!?  
**Mihono:** I can handle this many on my own\!  
**Mihono:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Mihono:** There's still more\!?  
**???:** We'll back you up\.  
**Mihono:** Huh?  
**Mihono:** Was that a beam she shot\!?  
**???:** YAH\!  
**Mihono:** She stopped the aradama with arrows\!?  
**???:** Don't just stand there; finish them off\!  
**Mihono:** O-Okay\! YAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**???:** Keep it up like that\.  
**???:** We'll slow the aradama down, so you can use that to take them out\!  
**Mihono:** I-I don't really know who you are, but\.\.\. I got it\!\!  

## 5: Secrecy
**Aradama:** ooo\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** That's the last of them\.\.\. I think\. Thanks a lot for helping me\!  
**???:** We only did what was natural\.  
**???:** I'm glad you're safe\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Uh, there's something I want to ask\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Mihono-chan\! Where are the aradama\!?  
**Mihono:** Ah, Mai\!  
**Mihono:** I already took care of them\. I had these people helping me\.\.\.  
**Miki:** Maria-san, Reimi-san?  
**Maria:** Miki\.\.\. Then, that would mean, these girls are\.\.\.  
**Miki:** Yep, that's right\. That girl is Asakura Mihono, and this one's Yanase Mai\.  
**Maria:** I'm Maria Traydor\.  
**Reimi:** And I'm Reimi Saionji\.  
**Mihono:** Maria-san and Reimi-san\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Um, who are you people, Miki-san?  
**Miki:** Eh?  
**Mihono:** Maria-san had a gun that shot beams, and I've never seen somebody fight aradama with a bow like Reimi-san\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Hey, Mai, there's no kind of archery that fights aradama, is there?  
**Mai:** \.\.\.There's not\. If there were archery like that, it would be very well known\.  
**Miki/Maria/Reimi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Maria:** It seems like it'd be faster to explain our circumstances\.  
**Reimi:** Hang on, Maria\! We don't have to tell people from this world about ourselves\!  
**Maria:** We can't get by without Mihono and Mai's\.\.\. without the help of toji\.  
**Maria:** We won't be able to move forward with them harboring suspicions towards us\.  
**Reimi:** Still\.\.\.  
**Miki:** I get what you mean, Reimi-san, but I think I'm with Maria-san here\.  
**Miki:** We haven't spent much time together, but I can tell we can trust Mihono and Mai\.  
**Reimi:** Miki\.\.\.  
**Reimi:** Alright\. I understand\. These two are going to be fighting alongside us, after all\. We shouldn't be hiding anything from each other\.  
**Reimi:** But, if that's what we've decided on, we should move somewhere quieter to explain ourselves\.  
**Maria:** Right\. I'll call Millie and Rena here too\.  
**Mai:** Explain yourselves? So you really were hiding something\.\.\.  
**Miki:** So you were doubting us after all\.\.\.?  
**Mihono:** It's not like I was doubting you\.\.\. Just, I did think it was weird\.  
**Maria:** Have no fear\. The secret we've been keeping shouldn't be anything like you're expecting\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.I'll decide on that on that after you tell us\.   
**Reimi:** Of course; that's fine too\.  

## 6: An Ocean of Stars
**Maria:** Rena and Millie still aren't here, but we're wasting time, so I'll go ahead and start\.  
**Maria:** I'll get straight to the point\. None of us are from this world\. We came here from a different one\.  
**Mai:** From a different world\.\.\.?  
**Reimi:** That's right, Mai-chan\.  
**Reimi:** Back from the future of another world\.\.\. We came here to this world from the star ocean\.  
**Mihono:** Eh? Eh? Star ocean; is that like, space?  
**Mihono:** And, you came from there to our world?  
**Mihono:** My head feels like it's spinning\.\.\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Why is it that all of your clothes are so different from each other?  
**Maria:** The differences in the eras and places we're from\.  
**Maria:** It seems like Miki and Welch knew each other before, but for the rest of us, it's our first time meeting\.  
**Mai:** So you're from different times and places\.\.\. But, you're all working together with each other\.\.\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Did you all come to our world for the same reason?  
**Maria:** Yes, that's the case\.  
**Maria:** We came to this world to recover geregere slime, a biribiri plasma rod, and an energy stone\. Those three materials\.  
**Maria:** The three of them are things that ordinarily should not exist in your world\.  
**Mai:** And, when you said you're helping with Tsugumi-san's research\.\.\. Was that just a way to gain access to those?  
**Maria:** That's right\.  
**Maria:** If I could add one thing\.\.\. Another of our goals is to stop Tsugumi's research\.  
**Mihono:** Eh? But, you can't do that\! I mean, I don't really get what it's about, but she's researching something amazing, right\!?  
**Reimi:** \.\.\.That's why we have to\.  
**Reimi:** This world wouldn't have any way to substantiate Tsugumi's research\.  
**Reimi:** But\.\.\. With those three materials, it suddenly becomes possible\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Mai:** Why was it that aradama absorbed those materials?  
**Maria:** They have a high affinity with noro\. To tell the truth, we had wanted to recover them all without making contact with anyone from this world\.  
**Mai:** I get it\.\.\. But because of that, you needed toji to help you\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mai:** When Welch-san stayed behind in the lab, was that just so she could get in the way of Tsugumi-san's research\.\.\.?  
**Maria:** \.\.\.\.\.\.This is for the sake of your world\.  
**Mihono:** But, Tsugumi-san's working so hard\.\.\.\.\.\. I kind of don't like that you're doing that\.  
**Reimi:** Maria, if you leave it at that, they're going to misunderstand\.  
**Mihono:** Huh?  
**Welch:** Hey, it's not like I have any intention of getting in Tsugumi's way?  
**Miki:** Welch's gotten way too interested in this world\.\.\. That's why Maria-san said, so she couldn't make trouble, Welch isn't allowed out of the lab\.  
**Welch:** Hey--\! It's not like that either\!\!  
**Welch:** Tsubumi's laboratory is just full of so much neat stuff that I haven't felt any reason to leave\! The whole world is packed up in here\~\!  
**Mihono:** H-Haha\.\.\. So that's all\. Somehow, hearing that's a relief\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.I understand most of what you're going through now\.  
**Maria:** We'd like for you to help us, Mai, Mihono\.  
**Maria:** We need your toji powers to keep this world protected\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Okay, I'll help you\. What about you, Mai?  
**Mai:** I'll\.\.\. help too\.  
**Miki:** Thank goodness\.\.\. If we didn't get you on our side, things would get really messed up\.  
**Mihono:** Messed up?  
**Maria:** If Tsugumi were to complete her research\.\.\. It could potentially destroy your world\.  

## 7: Threat to the World
**Maria:** If Tsugumi were to complete her research\.\.\. It could potentially destroy your world\.  
**Mihono:** It's that dangerous\!? Then, let's tell Tsugumi-san right away to stop the experiments\!\!  
**Maria:** \.\.\.We don't want to do that\. Tsugumi is a researcher, after all\.  
**Mihono:** She's a researcher\.\.\. Wait, what do you mean?  
**Maria:** What Tsugumi is studying really is something incredible\. A civilization mature enough to apply it properly might improve the lives of countless people\.  
**Maria:** But\.\.\. it's too soon for this world\.  
**Maria:** Would she really be able to stop halfway through researching something that incredible? Could she curb her curiousity? There's a chance it could have the opposite effect and only make her obsess over it\.  
**Mai:** Still\.\.\.  
**Reimi:** We can't dispel the fear that it would only increase the risks\. So, we decided that we shouldn't explain the situation to her\.  
**Mihono:** Mmm, but I think it'll go fine? If Tsugumi-san knew going on with her research could destroy the world, she'd stop it for sure\!  
**Welch:** I'm with Mihono on this\! Tsugumi's just like me\! So we can trust her\!  
**Miki:** Just like you\. That just makes me even more worried\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Maria-san\! Reimi-san\! Please give her a chance\!\!  
**Miki:** \.\.\.If Mihono's that sure about it, why don't we try talking to Tsugumi?  
**Mihono:** If it's hard for you to tell her about it, I'll do it\!  
**Maria:** That's not the issue here\.\.\. But fine then\.  
**Maria:** But if, on the other hand, Tsugumi tries to continue her research, we're going to keep her restrained until we finish collecting the three materials, understood?  
**Mihono:** Understood\! Then, I'll call up Tsugumi-san\!  
**Tsugumi:** I see, so that's what's been going on\. Then, we'll have to put a stop to this research, won't we\.  
**Mihono:** See, it's fine\!  
**Maria:** It seems so\.  
**Maria:** Now that Millie and Rena have made it back, I'd like to once more set out searching for the materials, but\.\.\. Mihono? Who are these two?  
**Mihono:** That's Chii-nee and Yui\! Since there's three things you had to look for, I thought it'd be better to have more help, so I brought them\!  
**Maria:** It wouldn't hurt to have more hands available, but\.\.\.  
**Yui:** I get to go on a mission with these pretty ladies\!? Score\! Thanks, Mihono-chan\!  
**Chie:** Yui-chan\. Mihono-chan told us the world was in danger, didn't she?  
**Yui:** I remember\!  
**Maria:** \.\.\.Will they really be up for this?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! Chii-nee and Yui are both really reliable toji\!  
**Maria:** \.\.\.Sigh\. We'll explain the details on the way\. \.\.\.Yui, you're coming with me\. We're recovering the energy stone\.  
**Maria:** You didn't need to come along with us, Reimi, Rena\.  
**Reimi:** I was a little worried after the harsh look you were giving Yui-chan\.  
**Reimi:** Do you\.\.\. not trust her?  
**Maria:** I don't doubt Mihono's appraisal of her\. Still\.\.\. with how she was acting, I highly doubt she has a proper grasp on the situation\.  
**Yui:** Maria-san\! What other places haven't you looked yet? Nothing's showing up on the spectrum finder, so we should check the next one\.  
**Maria:** Yui, you're suddenly taking this a lot more seriously, aren't you?  
**Yui:** Well, the world's in danger, right? Which means\.\.\. I can't fool around too much\. My sister's on the line here too\.  
**Reimi:** So you want to keep others safe\. \.\.\.She is a good toji\.  
**Maria:** \.\.\.It seems\.  
**Yui:** Thanks for the compliment\! Even better coming someone as good looking as you\!  
**Rena:** Hey, Yui\. That, spectrum finder you called it? Could I see it for a minute?  
**Yui:** Ah, sure thing\. Here you go, Rena-san\.  
**Rena:** Thanks\.  
**Rena:** Eh\!? Ehh\!? It started making noises all of a sudden\!?  
**Rena:** It stopped\.\.\.? Did I\.\.\. break it\!? I'm sorry, Yui\!\!  
**Yui:** No, that's not it\!\!  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Maria:** Aradama\!  
**Rena:** We'll back you up\! Yui, you finish off the aradama\!\!  
**Yui:** Right\!  
**Yui:** TORYAAAAAAAH\!\!  
**Aradama:** ooo\.\.\.  
**Rena:** Now if this aradama just had an energy stone\.\.\.  
**Yui:** There's noro, and\.\.\. Is that it\.\.\.?  
**Maria:** Yes, that's an energy stone\.  

## 8: Gluttons From the Stars
**Chie:** We're supposed to be looking for a biribiri plasma rod\.\.\. but now Millie-san's gotten lost somewhere\.\.\.  
**Miki:** Where'd you run off to, Millie\.\.\. Heeey\! Millie\!  
**Chie:** First, we should go back the way we came\. She might be waiting for us somewhere\.  
**Chie:** She's not here either\.\.\. I wonder when we got separated\.\.\.  
**Miki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Miki-san?  
**Miki:** I know this\.\.\.\!\!  
**Chie:** W-Wait, Miki-san\! Where are you going\!?  
**Chie:** (Miki-san must have found Millie-san\!\)  
**Miki:** Right here, Chie\!\!  
**Chie:** This is\.\.\. a roasted potatoes stand?   
**Miki:** This smell\.\.\. It smells so good\.\.\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Miki-san? Weren't we meant to be looking for Millie-san?  
**Miki:** O-Of course we are\! I just thought, Millie must have smelled this too and will come here\!  
**Chie:** You know that's not true\. We can leave the potatoes for after; let's find Millie-san now\.  
**Millie:** Something kinda smells really good\!  
**Millie:** \.\.\.Ah, Miki\! And Chie too\!\!  
**Miki:** Geez, where'd you disappear to? We were worried about you\!  
**Chie:** (We actually did find her\.\.\. These two must have big stomachs\.\.\.\)  
**Millie:** Ah, now that I've found you, I'm so relieved I'm hungry\.\.\.  
**Chie:** I'm hungry too, now that we can settle down\. I'll buy us some roasted potatoes, so how about we take a break?  
**Miki:** Can we\!?  
**Chie:** Sure; I'll be back in a minute\.  
**Millie/Miki:** Thanks for the food-\!  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Millie:** Uwah\!?  
**Miki:** Kya\!?  
**Chie:** Aradama\!? Are you two alright\!?  
**Millie:** We're fine, but our\.\.\.  
**Miki:** Our potatoes\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Ah, you dropped them just then, didn't you\.  
**Millie:** \.\.\.You're not getting away with that\.  
**Millie:** Miki\!  
**Miki:** Sure, Millie\!  
**Millie:** Tractor Beam\!  
**Aradama:** GUOO\!?  
**Miki:** Earth Grave\!\!  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!?  
**Chie:** That's incredible\.\.\. So that's the kind of power you have, Miki-san, Millie-san\.\.\.  
**Millie:** Chie\! Please finish it\!  
**Miki:** As payback for our potatoes\!  
**Chie:** R-Right\.\.\. HAAAAAAAH\!\!  
**Aradama:** oooo\.\.\.  
**Chie:** With the noro, there's\.\.\. so this is a biribiri plasma rod? Luckily we managed to get it\.  
**Chie:** Let's head on back, Miki-san, Millie-san\.  
**Millie:** Our potatoes\.\.\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.I guess there's no getting around that\. I'll buy you both one more\.  

## 9: To the Star Ocean
**Maria:** You have my thanks for helping us with these\.  
**Maria:** The geregere slime Mihono and Mai collected\. The energy stone Yui found\. And the biribiri plasma rod Chie gathered\.  
**Maria:** Now we have them all togethere\.  
**Mihono:** That means the world's not in danger anymore, right\.\.\.?  
**Reimi:** Yes, it's alright now\.  
**Mai:** Sigh, thank goodness\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Good work, everyone\.  
**Yui:** By the way, how are you all going to get back to your world, Maria-san?  
**Yui:** If you can't make it back for some reason, you're welcome to stay in my room\!  
**Maria:** We have this with us, so we'll be fine\.  
**Yui:** And what's that?  
**Maria:** A quad scanner\. With this\.\.\.  
**Chie:** The slime, rod, and stone are glowing\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Now that's a fascinating phenomenon\.  
**Maria:** We can now return at any time\.  
**Welch:** Wait; hold on\!  
**Welch:** Since we can go back anytime, that means we don't have to go back just yet, right\!?  
**Welch:** I haven't gotten my hands on the storm armor yettt\~\!\!  
**Miki:** \.\.\.Maybe it'd be better if we left right away\.  
**Miki:** Thanks, Mihono, Mai, Yui, Tsugumi\. And Chie, the potatoes were really tasty\!  
**Reimi:** Thank you for helping us\.\.\. It was fun\.  
**Rena:** Thanks for everything\! Maybe it's a bit imprudent, but it was nice having you take us around places\.  
**Millie:** Same\! I wish we could've done some sightseeing in the end\.\.\.  
**Welch:** Tomorrow\! At least wait until tomorrowwww\!\!  
**Millie:** \.\.\.I think we'd better go today\.  
**Maria:** So long, toji\.  
**Mihono:** They vanished\.\.\.  
**Mai:** It'd be nice if we saw them again\.\.\. but it's probably hard to do\.  
**Chie:** They did come from another world's future, after all\.  
**Yui:** I wish I could've had just one more day with them\.  
**Tsugumi:** Now then\.\.\. the real problem starts here\.  
**Yui:** Eh?  
**Tsugumi:** I already secured a budget for doing this research\.  
**Tsugumi:** And I know it's destined for failure\.\.\. so what now?
