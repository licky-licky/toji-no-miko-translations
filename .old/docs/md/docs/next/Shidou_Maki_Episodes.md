## 1: The Charismatic Toji
**Maki:** --Aradama sighted\! Engaging in combat\!  
**Subordinate A:** Shidou-san\! You're pushing too far ahead\! You're our captain, so please don't be so risky\!  
**Maki:** It's because I'm the captain that I need to take the lead\. I couldn't stand seeing any of my girls get hurt\.  
**Subordinate:** B: Shidou-san\! There's a giant aradama approaching from the northeast\!  
**Maki:** What\!? \.\.\.This one seems difficult\.  
**Maki:** I'll manage that one by myself\. The rest of you, get rid of the aradama in the surrounding area\.  
**Subordinate A:** Are you serious\!? That's too much for anyone to fight alone\!\!  
**Maki:** Don't worry\. Have faith in me\!  
**Maki:** Nice job\. It's thanks to all your efforts that we were able to finish this without casualties\.  
**Subordinate A:** We only stayed safe because you took care of that dangerous aradama all by yourself, Shidou-san\.  
**Subordinate B:** Your strength is on a completely different level than ours\. That's why I admire you so much, Shidou-san\.   
**Maki:** I have to be\. I'm the captain, after all\.  
**Subordinate A:** I love how humble you can be about your accomplishments too\.\.\.  
**Subordinate B:** Shidou-san's smoother than any guy, isn't she\.\.\.  
**Subordinate C:** Sigh\.\.\. You're such a ladykiller, Shidou-san\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** --Good work, Maki-san\. It seems you've accomplished quite a lot again today\.  
**Suzuka:** And you're as popular as ever among the girls of your unit\.  
**Maki:** It'd be bad if the captain wasn't popular, you know\.  
**Suzuka:** I believe it's a slightly different sort of popularity than you think, though\.  
**Suzuka:** (Maki-san can truly be dense about that sort of thing\. Fufufu\. Well, that may also be part of the reason behind her popularity\.\)  

## 2: Shidou Maki's Resolve
**Maki:** Excuse me, Yukari-sama\. It's Shidou Maki\. Starting today, I'll be in your care as the first seat of the elite guard\.  
**Yukari:** --Enter\.  
**Subordinate A:** --GYAAAA-\!\!  
**Subordinate B:** Somebody\.\.\. Somebody, help me\!\!  
**Maki:** Just hold on\! I'll stop the aradama--  
**Subordinate C:** Shidou-san\! It's too much for you to do anything about\! I hate it too, but we need to escape\!  
**Maki:** How can you say that\!? Those are our comrades at its feet\!\!  
**Maki:** As the captain, I refuse to leave any of them behind\!\!  
**Subordinate C:** Please, get a hold of yourself\!\! With the way that aradama struck them down, it's already too late for them\!\!  
**Subordinate C:** If you don't give the order to retreat now, the whole unit will be wiped out\!\!  
**Maki:** --Shit\!\! I'm supposed to be their captain\.\.\.\!\!  
**Maki:** But if I had the strength for it, this never should have happened\.\.\.\!\!  
**Maki:** --On that day, many from my unit were badly wounded\.  
**Maki:** They had such promising futures, and yet, with no hope of recovery, they had to be retired\.  
**Maki:** I'll never forget the helplessness I felt back then\. Not a moment has gone by that it hasn't agonized me\.  
**Maki:** Justice is meaningless without the strength to back it up- Without the power to protect\.  
**Maki:** To protect the people at your side\. If I can reach that power\.\.\. I don't care if it comes from heaven or hell\.  
**Maki:** Today, as the first seat of Yukari-sama's elite guard, I'll allow myself to be injected with noro\.  
**Maki:** I hate the idea of letting noro in my body, but it's better than losing my comrades again\. Than seeing the tears that were shed that day again\.  
**Maki:** Under Yukari-sama, I swear I'll purge every last aradama from the face of the earth\.\.\.\!\!  

## 3: Maki's Lecture
**Maki:** Yume\. We need to talk\.  
**Maki:** The other day, you were ordered to lead a unit on a mission\. But I heard you got carried away in battle and left them on their own?  
**Maki:** Without their captain around, your subordinates will fall into chaos\. Don't forget your duty as their leader\.  
**Yume:** But that's not my problem\! They should all be able to take care of themselves\!  
**Maki:** That's not what it means to be captain, you know\.  
**Maki:** I've received some complaints from the toji you worked with\. I'm going to read them now, so pay attention\.  
**Maki:** --Captain Tsubakuro abandoned us in the middle of battle chasing an aradama\. She didn't return for another hour\.  
**Maki:** --On top of abandoning us, Captain Tsubakuro did not respond to our attempts to contact her\. It was difficult to continue without being given orders\.  
**Maki:** --Please, Captain Tsubakuro, I'm begging you\. Don't go running off with aradama you don't know\.  
**Yume:** Well of course I didn't know that aradama\! I don't know any aradama\!  
**Yume:** Besides, those girls are way too needy\~\! If the captain's gone, then everyone can just be their own captain\!  
**Maki:** YOU COMPLETE IDIOT\!\!  
**Yume:** Hya\!?  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Even I've put people in danger by pushing too far ahead\.  
**Maki:** But that's no excuse not to reflect on your mistakes\. Don't try to pass your responsibility onto them\.  
**Maki:** If you're going to keep putting your unit in danger, then you won't be assigned missions anymore\.  
**Maki:** You always say you want everyone to remember how amazing you are, but at this rate they'll only remember you as a failure\.  
**Yume:** No\! I don't want that\!  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Everyone already knows just how strong you are, Yume\. You should show them what a capable leader you can be too\!  
**Yume:** \.\.\.Oh\.\.\. I got it\!  
**Yume:** Then, next time I'm in charge, I'll fight all the aradama myself\! Then they'll see how capable I am\!  
**Maki:** It's hard to even call that a unit at this point\.\.\.  

## 4: The Overworking Subordinate
**Watanuki Kazumi:** --Maki-sama\. I've finished writing the report you entrusted me with\. Would you like to go over it?  
**Maki:** Of course\. Sorry to keep relying on you like this\.  
**Kazumi:** Think nothing of it\. In fact, I'm grateful you would let me work on something Yukari-sama herself would read\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Hmm\. Alright, I'm done\. It's very well written\.  
**Kazumi:** Of course\. After you assigned it to me, I wouldn't settle for anything less than perfect\.  
**Maki:** Thanks\. You're so reliable, Kazumi\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.By the way, I couldn't help but notice the bags under your eyes\. Did you have to stay up late working on this?  
**Kazumi:** Please, pay it no mind\. I only went one night without sleeping\.  
**Maki:** You pulled an all-nighter\!? There's not much left to do today, so please, go back to your room and sleep\.  
**Kazumi:** No, I wouldn't have had to stay up all night if not for my inexperience\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Kazumi, don't overwork yourself\. It's a bad habit of yours to push yourself harder than you have to\.  
**Kazumi:** No, I can still--  
**Kazumi:** (I have to give everything I can\. It's the only way I can be useful to Maki-sama\.\.\.\)  
**Kazumi:** --We've been called to action\. Aradama have appeared, it seems\. Maki-sama, let's go\.  
**Maki:** Stay here, Kazumi\.  
**Maki:** If you won't rest, I'll have to punish myself for poorly managing you\.  
**Kazumi:** You'd punish yourself over me\.\.\.  
**Kazumi:** I understand\. If you insist, I'll get some rest\.\.\. You're so kind, Maki-sama\.  
**Maki:** You're my precious subordinate, after all\.  
**Maki:** Anyway, I'm going\. You be sure to get some sleep in your room\.  
**Kazumi:** Maki-sama\.\.\. I dream of one day being able to stand by your side the way Konohana-sama does\.  

## 5: Absolute Trust
**Maki:** --Hey, Suzuka\. Have you seen my phone anywhere?  
**Suzuka:** It's over on the desk\.  
**Maki:** Ah, you're right\. I guess I left it in the office\.  
**Suzuka:** I can't believe you\.\.\. You're too careless\. What if someone had taken for some wrongdoing?  
**Maki:** Wrongdoing? The only people allowed in here are those authorized by the elite guard\.  
**Suzuka:** Ara, but what if I decided to play a prank on you?  
**Maki:** You wouldn't do something like that\. After all the hardships we've been through together, I know I can count on you\.  
**Suzuka:** --There was that time we were separated from the others and had to fight off aradama together for quite some time, wasn't there\.  
**Maki:** Yeah\. We didn't even have enough provisions, so we had to share a meal\. I remember thinking at the time that, no matter what happened after, I could always trust you to watch my back\.  
**Suzuka:** Yes\. At the time, I also decided you were worth relying on as a fighter and a person\.  
**Suzuka:** --On a somewhat related note\. I did play a little prank on you, because of our closeness\.  
**Suzuka:** After all, I know you'll forgive me, Maki-san, if I get a little mischievous with you\.  
**Maki:** You shouldn't abuse someone's trust like that\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Fufu\. Anyway, are you aware I know the password to your phone?  
**Maki:** Eh-\!? How\!?  
**Suzuka:** You always hold your phone horizontally, so watching you input it was child's play\.  
**Maki:** I-I didn't know you were watching\.\.\. And hey, isn't it common courtesy not to watch someone put their password in?  
**Maki:** I mean, I don't know your phone's password, Suzuka\.  
**Suzuka:** You just aren't very observant, Maki-san\.  
**Maki:** That's still not a good reason\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Anyway, jokes aside, I wanted to show how you never know what risks you may be taking\.  
**Suzuka:** To begin with, an emergency call could come in at any time, so you ought to always keep your phone with you\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.You have a point there\. I'll be more careful from now on\.

## [VRS Equipment - Maki: Start\]: Just to Be Sure
**Yume:** Found you, Maki-onee-san\!  
**Maki:** Yume, what do you need? I thought you had the day off today\.  
**Yume:** Don't you have it off too, Maki-onee-san? Hey hey-, since we have free time, don't you want to play a game together?  
**Maki:** A game?  
**Yume:** Some toji onee-sans made a VR game in their lab, and people are saying it's super fun\.  
**Maki:** VR\.\.\. I think I'll have to turn you down this time\.  
**Yume:** Ehh, you should go-\. They said it's really easy to play too, so you'll be fine even though you're dumb with technology, Maki-onee-san\.  
**Maki:** I-I wasn't worried about that\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Then, Maki-san, since you have this opportunity on your day off, why not go and play with Yume?  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Doesn't seem like I have much of a choice\. If you don't mind me acting as a chaperone, then I'll go\.  
**Yume:** Yaay\! I get to go out with Maki-onee-san\! That makes me happy\. Let's get going then-\!  
**Tsugumi:** I'm surprised to see two of the elite guard arrive\. It might be unexpected, but I'm glad you're here\. I'll have two stations ready for you right away\.  
**Maki:** Hang on a minute, I'm only here to chaperone her\.  
**Yume:** Ehh-, but we're already here, so you should just do it too, Maki-onee-san-\!  
**Maki:** But\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** If you're concerned with the safety of it, you have nothing to worry about\. Fighting within the game should be safer than your ordinary battles with aradama\.  
**Maki:** Well, I can't argue with that\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** By the way, we're currently hosting an event\. Whoever can score highest in the battle stage will be given a prize of cream puffs from a popular store\.  
**Yume:** Ahh\! That's that store Suzuka-onee-san loves, isn't it\! Hey hey, Maki-onee-san, if you win, then won't Suzuka-onee-san be really happy?  
**Yume:** You should play for Suzuka-onee-san too-\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.I guess, if I have to\. Fine, if I'm doing this, then I'll aim for the top\!  
**Yume:** Hooray-\! Let's try our best, Maki-onee-san\!  
**Tsugumi:** There, now everything is ready\.\.\. Hm? Shidou-san, why are you holding your okatana?  
**Maki:** Since I'm going to a strange world fighting unknown enemies, I want to take every precaution\.  
**Tsugumi:** I see\. Though, in this game, you'll be battling with laser guns, so your okatana won't be necessary\.\.\. But, if it gives you peace of mind, that's okay\.  
**Tsugumi:** Now then, let's start the game\. Take care\.  
**Yume:** Wow-\! So this is the game world\! The city's all pretty and shiny\!  
**Yume:** Let's go on the roof of that building\! Juuump\!  
**Maki:** Yume, wait for me\! Okay, I'll do it too\.\.\. EII\!  
**Maki:** This is amazing\! The game world improved our jumping ability by this much\. I can leap from building to building like I were using hachimanriki\.  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san\! Let's go up to the top of that tower\!  
**Maki:** Sure, let's go\!  
**Maki:** Ahh, the city skyline at night really is beautiful\. I wish Suzuka and them could be here to see this\.\.\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Huh? Yume? Yume, where did you go?  
**Maki:** We must have gotten separated while I was looking at the skyline\.  
**Maki:** Heeey, Yume\! Where are you? If you're hiding, then say something\! Yume-\!  
**Maki:** \.\.\.No use\. She's not responding\. Ban Tsugumi said it was safe here, but it's still too dangerous to explore an unknown world on your own\.  
**Maki:** I need to calm down and deal with the situation\. At times like this, you need to\.\.\.  

## [VRS Equipment - Maki: End\]: What Suits Me Best
**Maki:** Heeey, Yume\! Where did you go? Say something back\. Yume-\!  
**Maki:** Hm, that sound\. The battle stage must be starting\. If I follow the enemies, maybe I'll join up with Yume\. I'll focus on the battle for now\.  
**Maki:** If I remember right, the command to bring out the laser gun was\.\.\. Okay, I got it\. Now I just point it at the enemies on the opposite building\.\.\.  
**Maki:** Kh, why can't I pull the trigger\!? The command to pull the trigger was\.\.\.  
**Maki:** Ah-- While I was working with it, the enemies got right in front of me\! Damn, how should I\.\.\.  
**Maki:** Ah--\! That's right, I still have that, don't I\! It might be tasteless of me to use my okatana in the game, but\.\.\.  
**Maki:** Here I come\! SERYAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Maki:** Good\! I can defeat them with my okatana too\. I'll keep this up and wipe them out\! HAAAAAAHH\!  
**Yume:** Ehh-- Hey, Maki-onee-san?  
**Maki:** Yume\! That's good, you're safe\! I'll finish them all off in a minute\! HAAAAAAHH\!  
**Yume:** Come on-, Maki-onee-san\! It's a game, so fight with your laser gun already-\.  
**Maki:** An okatana seems to be what suits me best after all\. Alright, this should finish them\! YAAAAAAHH\!  
**Maki:** Alright, battle stage clear\. Good work, Yume\.  
**Yume:** I wasn't working at all-\. You beat them all by yourself out of nowhere, Maki-onee-san\.  
**Maki:** I see, sorry about that\. Anyway, how about we enjoy a look around the city now?  
**Yume:** Okay\!  
**Tsugumi:** Welcome back\. Did you two have a good time?  
**Yume:** Yeah\! Maki-onee-san beat everything in the battle stage first, so I didn't get to do anything, but it was a lot of fun jumping around between the buildings-\.  
**Maki:** It was\. The virtual world was more detailed than I imagined, and it was satisfying seeing every nook and cranny of the city\.  
**Tsugumi:** That's good to hear\. Now then, as all challengers have finished their runs, the results of the battle stage will now be revealed\.  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san beat them all straight away, so there's no way she didn't take first place\!  
**Maki:** That's right, I got serious hoping for that\. Let's see the rankings\.  
**Maki:** What\!? We came in last place\!?  
**Yume:** Eh-\!? But why? We should've been first in beating the most enemies and beating them fastest\. Why are we last-?  
**Tsugumi:** At first, I was just as perplexed as to why you two didn't earn any points in the battle\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** When investigating the cause, we came to the conclusion that there was a problem with how you defeated the enemies\.  
**Tsugumi:** Did you use something besides the laser gun to defeat them?  
**Maki:** Kh\.\.\. So you don't get any points for defeating them with okatana\.\.\.  
**Yume:** We're back-\!  
**Maki:** \.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Welcome back, the two of you\. Oh, Maki-san, what's the matter? That's an awfully gloomy look on your face\.  
**Yume:** You still can't get over that we lost, Maki-onee-san? Cheer up, okay-\.  
**Maki:** Th-That's not it\. It's just\.\.\. I planned on coming back with Suzuka's favorite cream puffs, but instead\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Well now, is that why you're in such low spirits\. Fufu\. Maki-san, please lift up your head\.  
**Suzuka:** I would be happy to have those cream puffs, but your feelings alone are enough to satisfy me\.  
**Maki:** Suzuka\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Next time, I'd like for all of us to go play that game together\.  
**Maki:** Right, sure thing\. By that time, I'll master my way around a laser gun\.

## [SDDT - Maki: Start\]: Maki of the Special Defense Team
**Maki:** Hmph\! \.\.\.Hmph\!  
**Yume:** Ah, I finally found you, Maki-onee-san\!  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Nn? What do you need, Yume?  
**Yume:** Is it true you're going on a trip alone together with Suzuka-onee-san? Why am I the only one who has to stay behind\! It's boring here\!  
**Maki:** Who told you something that misleading\.\.\. We're not going on a trip; we're suppressing aradama\.  
**Yume:** That sounds even funner\! You two get to do all the good stuff\!  
**Maki:** Don't act so spoiled, Yume\. With us having only just been reorganized into the Special Defense Team, we're short on hands\.  
**Maki:** We can't afford to neglect our duty to guard the Origami family and escort Akane-sama\. Do you understand what I'm saying?  
**Yume:** \.\.\.Well, if I have to-\.  
**Yume:** But you better buy me a souvenir\!\! Get me an Ichigo Daifuku Neko they sell there\!  
**Maki:** Got it\. I'll buy you one, so long as I don't forget\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Why the troubled face? How about you have a drink of tea and relax?  
**Maki:** I'll take it\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** You don't have to be so nervous\. This will go fine\. We only have to do it like we normally do\.  
**Maki:** I'm not feeling nervous\. It's just\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Just?  
**Maki:** It's just a little hard to calm down\.  
**Suzuka:** Doesn't that mean you're getting nervous?  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Maybe\. I guess you're right\.  
**Suzuka:** That's how you are, Maki-san\.  
**Maki:** It's because we can't stop for anything until we atone for the past\.  
**Suzuka:** You aren't entirely wrong to think that way, but\.\.\. If you obsess over it, you'll only be making yourself suffer, alright?  
**Maki:** I know that, but, still\.  
**Suzuka:** You're very serious, Maki-san\.  
**Maki:** That's just how I am; I can't help it\.  
**Maki:** By the way\.\.\. Do you think they sell Ichigo Daifuku Nekos where the mission is taking place?  
**Suzuka:** Did Yume ask about it?  
**Maki:** Seems like she wants a souvenir\.  
**Suzuka:** Of course she would\. I'll look into it\.  

## [SDDT - Maki: End\]: Like a Hero
**Maki:** HAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** oooo\.\.\.  
**Maki:** There's more of them than I was expecting\.\.\. Was it a mistake to split up from Suzuka\.\.\.?  
**Maki:** It speeds up the rate we deal with them, but\.\.\.\!  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Maki:** YAAAH\!\!  
**Maki:** Damn, I can't even get time to catch my breath\.  
**Maki:** More of them are still coming\.\.\.?  
**Maki:** The situation'll just keep getting worse as it is\. I'll regroup with Suzuka so we can rethink our strategy\.  
**Suzuka:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** [pant, pant\]\.\.\. These numbers may be too much after all\.  
**Suzuka:** I should regroup with Maki-san for now\.\.\.  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Suzuka:** Kh\.\.\. For me to have let my guard down here\.\.\.\!\!  
**Suzuka:** So I'm surrounded then\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.What a mess I've put myself in\. Fatigue must have caused my concentration to slip\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Though, don't assume I'll be beaten so easily\!  
**Maki:** SUZUKA--------\!\!  
**Suzuka:** Eh?  
**Maki:** Are you okay\!?  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san\.\.\.?  
**Maki:** Can you stand? Are you hurt?  
**Suzuka:** I'm just fine\. Though\.\.\.  
**Maki:** Though?  
**Suzuka:** For you to arrive with such perfect timing to rescue me\.\.\. I'm a bit bewildered is all\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.You seem like you're fine enough to me\.  
**Suzuka:** Of course I am\. Just who do you think you're partnered with?  
**Maki:** The former second seat of the elite guard, Konohana Suzuka, if I recall\.  
**Suzuka:** That's right\. I won't have you looking down on me\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Let's take them all out at once\!  
**Suzuka:** Understood, Maki-san\!  
**Suzuka:** You saved me, back there\.  
**Maki:** I only did what needed to be done\.  
**Maki:** Anyway, did you look into whether they sell any Ichigo Daifuku Neko goods here?  
**Suzuka:** Why yes, of course I looked it up\.  
**Maki:** Oh, that's good\.  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, allow me to lead the way\.

## [Journey to the West - Maki: Start\]: A Different Way of Using It
**Maki:** \.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san? Why the troubled face?  
**Maki:** Oh, Suzuka\.  
**Maki:** There's a lot of toji using VR for training lately, right?  
**Suzuka:** It seems that way\.  
**Maki:** It's good broaden people's options for training\. But\.\.\. I'm wondering if there's anything else we can use VR for\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.  
**Maki:** Suzuka?  
**Suzuka:** I just never expected to hear that from someone as technologically inept as you\.  
**Maki:** I'll admit I'm a little bad when it comes to using gadgets\. But, it's impressive, wasn't it?  
**Maki:** So it just crossed my mind\.  
**Suzuka:** I do agree it's an interesting idea\. I'll see if I can think of anything too\.  
**Maki:** A PV?  
**Suzuka:** Yes\. A promotional video for toji, with a play staged in VR\.  
**Maki:** A play\.\.\.?  
**Suzuka:** I called it that, but we won't actually be acting out roles\.  
**Suzuka:** Something more of a staged sword fight, you could call it\.  
**Suzuka:** When I consulted with Ban-san, she said it would be feasible, so long as she recorded the fighting and edited the footage\.  
**Maki:** So she just needs us to fight then\.\.\. Alright, that plan sounds good\.  
**Maki:** We should be able to make it happen\.  
**Suzuka:** I've already given Ban-san the go ahead\.  
**Maki:** You always get things rolling\. Let's go see Ban Tsugumi then\.  
**Tsugumi:** Come to visit?  
**Maki:** Yeah\. Is everything coming along?  
**Tsugumi:** I have it ready for you\.  
**Tsugumi:** Just for a test, the current configuration is set to "Journey to the West"; will that be an issue?  
**Maki:** Not at all\.  
**Maki:** We just need to play characters from Journey to the West, right?  
**Tsugumi:** That's the case\.  
**Tsugumi:** Were there any you wanted to play in particular? If not, I can assign you to what fits\.  
**Suzuka:** That would be fine\. We'll be in your care\.  

## [Journey to the West - Maki: End\]: We'll All Do It Next Time
**Tsugumi:** Now then, we'll begin the action\. Is everyone ready?  
**Maki:** No problems here\. What about you, Suzuka?  
**Suzuka:** I'm fine as well\.  
**Tsugumi:** Then, I'll introduce enemies\. They'll begin moving as soon as you start, so please bear that in mind\.  
**Maki:** Sure, we've got it\.  
**Maki:** Alright, let's start\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** One thing before that, Maki-san\. Should we go over how we plan to fight?  
**Maki:** How? Aren't we going to fight like normal?  
**Suzuka:** There wouldn't be much appeal in that\. Given that we're in VR, I think we should use this opportunity to fight differently\.  
**Maki:** Differently from normal\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** If I can collect different combat data than your ordinary battles, I'd very much welcome that too\.  
**Maki:** Alright, I'll try coming up with something\. How about, using the buildings to fight?  
**Maki:** Suzuka\.  
**Suzuka:** To move about three-dimensionally? It sounds interesting\.  
**Maki:** We're going to move up to the top of this building, so start whenever you feel the timing's right\.  
**Maki:** Yoh, hoh\!  
**Villain:** \!\!  
**Maki:** Spotted the enemy\! Suzuka\!  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san\!?  
**Maki:** HAAAH\!\!  
**Villain:** \.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san, you're moving around too haphazardly\.\.\.  
**Maki:** Sorry about that\. I could just move my body so freely I couldn't help it\.  
**Suzuka:** Did it give you any nausea?   
**Maki:** My vision's spinning around\.\.\. I think I might be a little motion sick\.  
**Suzuka:** Ban-san, let's take a short break\.  
**Tsugumi:** I've finished recording the fight scene as we planned\.  
**Tsugumi:** This here is a sample of it\. Please watch over it to decide whether or not we should make a PV from it\.  
**Maki:** Sure, I'll give it a watch\. Thanks too; this was a good experience\.  
Several days later\.

  
**Yume:** This is so cool-\! It's like you onee-sans are really fighting around in Journey to the West\!  
**Yume:** And actually, that's no fair\! I want to do that too\! I want to film a whole bunch of me being cool\!  
**Maki:** Sure\. Then, next time, let's all do it\.

## [Xmas' 20 - Maki: Start\]: Looking for a Christmas Cake
**Maki:** \.\.\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Maki-onee-san, how long're you planning on doing this for-?  
**Maki:** Just give me a little longer, Yume\.  
**Maki:** This cake has to be a Christmas cake, but at the same time it also has to be Yomi's birthday cake\.  
**Maki:** Finding a cake that Yomi'll like\.\.\. It's tough\.  
**Yume:** Oh, okay\.  
**Maki:** Thinking about what Yomi likes, there's omusubi, but\.\.\.  
**Yume:** Then, can't we just go with a rice cake?  
**Maki:** A rice cake\.\.\. That's true; with a name like that, Yomi'd probably like it\.  
**Maki:** Okay, let's buy one\!  
**Maki:** This isn't good, Suzuka\!  
**Suzuka:** What's the matter?  
**Maki:** Rice cakes aren't actually cakes\!  
**Suzuka:** That's right, they aren't?  
**Maki:** \.\.\.You knew about that?  
**Suzuka:** Yes\. If you look up the word rice cake, you'll find mochi\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** That isn't what you ordered, is it, Maki-san?  
**Maki:** Yeah\. What I got was something like puffed up rice in a disc shape\.  
**Suzuka:** That sounds about right\.  
**Suzuka:** Honestly, why would you order something like that?  
**Maki:** I thought it'd make Yomi happy, as a Christmas cake\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** What am I going to do with you\.  
**Suzuka:** Rice cakes are something you can eat like crackers\.  
**Suzuka:** All we can do now is prepare a different cake for Yomi-san's birthday\.  
**Suzuka:** Fortunately, we still have time to spare\.  
**Maki:** Oh yeah\.\.\. You're right\.  
**Maki:** I'll look for another cake Yomi'll be happy with\.  

## [Xmas' 20 - Maki: Start\]: With a Special Someone
**Maki:** Still though, a different cake\.\.\. What can I get?  
**Ellen:** Makimaki\! You look like something's bothering you; what're you up to?  
**Maki:** Kohagura? Actually\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** I see, so you're worried over what to get for Yomiyomi's birthday cake\.  
**Ellen:** In that case, there's a shop I can recommend to you\!  
**Maki:** Really\!?  
**Ellen:** Yes\! It's been my favorite lately\!  
**Maki:** That sounds reliable\.  
**Ellen:** Though, I'll give you a bit of advice\. I'm sure that, whatever cake you get for her, Yomiyomi will be happy\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.Could you tell me why you think that?  
**Ellen:** Anyone would be happy with whatever someone tried so hard to pick out for them\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.  
**Maki:** You're right; maybe I've been overthinking this a little\. I'll pay that cake shop a visit\.  
**Ellen:** I hope it'll make your Christmas Day wonderful\!  
On Christmas Eve\.

  
**Maki:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.  
**Watanuki Kazumi:** Maki-sama\!  
**Kazumi:** There's no more readings on the spectrum finder\. That aradama seems to have been the last of them\.  
**Maki:** Alright\.\.\. Good work, everybody\.  
**Tojis:** Right\!  
**Maki:** It's Christmas Eve\. Some of you must have plans\.  
**Maki:** You should spend the rest of the night with the people special to you\.  
**Tojis:** Okay\!\!  
**Kazumi:** Err, Maki-sama, do you have any plans for later\.\.\.? If you wouldn't mind\.\.\.  
**Maki:** I have to be at a Christmas and birthday party for Yomi\.  
**Kazumi:** \.\.\.I see then\.  
**Kazumi:** I hope you'll enjoy yourself\!  
**Maki:** Thanks, Kazumi\. I hope you'll have a good Christmas Eve too\.  
**Kazumi:** \.\.\.Right\!
