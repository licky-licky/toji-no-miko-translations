## [Special Defense Team - Suzuka: Start\]: Suzuka of the Special Defense Team
**Suzuka:** Now then, I'll go about explaining our next mission\.  
**Maki:** We're suppressing aradama, right?  
**Suzuka:** Yes, it will be a bit of a trip\. It's been some time since you and I took an assignment together, Maki-san\.  
**Maki:** With both of us, it'd be extremely unlikely anything goes wrong, but\.\.\. It hasn't been long since we were put in the special defense team\.  
**Maki:** Let's keep ourselves focused\.  
**Suzuka:** Of course\.  
**Suzuka:** Even seen favorably, the special defense team is simply a re-organizing of the old Origami family elite guard\.  
**Suzuka:** There are still those keeping a harsh eye on us now, so all we can do is to continue producing results\.  
**Suzuka:** I don't see any\.\.\. responses to aradama\.  
**Maki:** Doesn't seem like there's any around here\. If we had Yomi with us right about now\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** She would have found them easily\.  
**Suzuka:** Yet\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Though we were re-assembled directly under Akane-sama\.\.\. If the four of us were to be acting together, it would invite needless suspicion\.  
**Suzuka:** We need to endure it for the time being\.  
**Maki:** We can't let pointless gossip make Yukari-sama's situation worse than it already is\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.I'm going to hang around here a little longer\. What about you, Suzuka?  
**Suzuka:** Let's see\.\.\. We should rest for the night\.  
**Maki:** Got it\. You go on back first, Suzuka\.  
**Suzuka:** No, you'll be coming back with me, Maki-san\.  
**Maki:** If you're worried about me, don't be\. An aradama's not going to get the better of me just because I lost one night of sleep\.  
**Suzuka:** I believe you\. But, what if it's two nights instead of one? What if we still haven't found the aradama then?  
**Suzuka:** Do you plan on keeping yourself awake all this time?  
**Maki:** Then I'll\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** It would be too much, even for you\. Wouldn't it, Maki-san?  
**Suzuka:** If all you do is stretch yourself thin, you'll break in no time\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.You're right\. Alright, Suzuka\.  
**Maki:** I'll go rest too\.

## [Special Defense Team - Suzuka: End\]: In Harmony
**Suzuka:** Nn\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** (It's still dark out, and yet I'm awake now\.\.\. Oh?\)  
**Suzuka:** (Maki-san is looking outside\.\.\.?\)  
**Maki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san?  
**Maki:** Suzuka\.\.\. Did I wake you?  
**Suzuka:** You didn't\.\.\. What time is it now?  
**Maki:** It just turned five\.  
**Suzuka:** Not much longer till the sunrise then\.  
**Suzuka:** Nnnh\.\.\.\.\.\.\! Have you been up like this the whole time?  
**Maki:** No, I only just got up myself\. If I didn't sleep properly, somebody'd get mad at me\.  
**Suzuka:** Oh my, is there someone so frightening as to get angry with the former first seat of the elite guard?  
**Maki:** Yeah, she's always around\. It's a real help\.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san\!  
**Maki:** Suzuka, get ready quick\! We're leaving\!  
**Suzuka:** YAAH\!  
**Aradama:** OOOOoooo\.\.\.  
**Maki:** There's more than expected\.\.\. HAAH\!\!  
**Suzuka:** We made the right choice to get a good night's rest\.  
**Maki:** That's for sure\.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san, feel free to move as you please\. I'll stay with you and cover your blind spot\.  
**Maki:** I'll be fine if you move freely yourself, Suzuka\. I can at least tell where your blind spot is\.  
**Suzuka:** Are you sure?  
**Maki:** Yeah, leave it to me\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Suzuka/Maki:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** GYOOOOoooo\.\.\.  
**Maki:** How's that?  
**Suzuka:** We've still only brought down two of them\. We'll keep going at this pace\!  
**Maki:** Of course\!  
**Suzuka:** (Honestly\.\.\. Your back is so warm\.\)

## [Journey to the West - Maki: Start\]: A Different Way of Using It
**Maki:** \.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san? Why the troubled face?  
**Maki:** Oh, Suzuka\.  
**Maki:** There's a lot of toji using VR for training lately, right?  
**Suzuka:** It seems that way\.  
**Maki:** It's good broaden people's options for training\. But\.\.\. I'm wondering if there's anything else we can use VR for\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.  
**Maki:** Suzuka?  
**Suzuka:** I just never expected to hear that from someone as technologically inept as you\.  
**Maki:** I'll admit I'm a little bad when it comes to using gadgets\. But, it's impressive, wasn't it?  
**Maki:** So it just crossed my mind\.  
**Suzuka:** I do agree it's an interesting idea\. I'll see if I can think of anything too\.  
**Maki:** A PV?  
**Suzuka:** Yes\. A promotional video for toji, with a play staged in VR\.  
**Maki:** A play\.\.\.?  
**Suzuka:** I called it that, but we won't actually be acting out roles\.  
**Suzuka:** Something more of a staged sword fight, you could call it\.  
**Suzuka:** When I consulted with Ban-san, she said it would be feasible, so long as she recorded the fighting and edited the footage\.  
**Maki:** So she just needs us to fight then\.\.\. Alright, that plan sounds good\.  
**Maki:** We should be able to make it happen\.  
**Suzuka:** I've already given Ban-san the go ahead\.  
**Maki:** You always get things rolling\. Let's go see Ban Tsugumi then\.  
**Tsugumi:** Come to visit?  
**Maki:** Yeah\. Is everything coming along?  
**Tsugumi:** I have it ready for you\.  
**Tsugumi:** Just for a test, the current configuration is set to "Journey to the West"; will that be an issue?  
**Maki:** Not at all\.  
**Maki:** We just need to play characters from Journey to the West, right?  
**Tsugumi:** That's the case\.  
**Tsugumi:** Were there any you wanted to play in particular? If not, I can assign you to what fits\.  
**Suzuka:** That would be fine\. We'll be in your care\.

## [Journey to the West - Maki: End\]: We'll All Do It Next Time
**Tsugumi:** Now then, we'll begin the action\. Is everyone ready?  
**Maki:** No problems here\. What about you, Suzuka?  
**Suzuka:** I'm fine as well\.  
**Tsugumi:** Then, I'll introduce enemies\. They'll begin moving as soon as you start, so please bear that in mind\.  
**Maki:** Sure, we've got it\.  
**Maki:** Alright, let's start\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** One thing before that, Maki-san\. Should we go over how we plan to fight?  
**Maki:** How? Aren't we going to fight like normal?  
**Suzuka:** There wouldn't be much appeal in that\. Given that we're in VR, I think we should use this opportunity to fight differently\.  
**Maki:** Differently from normal\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** If I can collect different combat data than your ordinary battles, I'd very much welcome that too\.  
**Maki:** Alright, I'll try coming up with something\. How about, using the buildings to fight?  
**Maki:** Suzuka\.  
**Suzuka:** To move about three-dimensionally? It sounds interesting\.  
**Maki:** We're going to move up to the top of this building, so start whenever you feel the timing's right\.  
**Maki:** Yoh, hoh\!  
**Villain:** \!\!  
**Maki:** Spotted the enemy\! Suzuka\!  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san\!?  
**Maki:** HAAAH\!\!  
**Villain:** \.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san, you're moving around too haphazardly\.\.\.  
**Maki:** Sorry about that\. I could just move my body so freely I couldn't help it\.  
**Suzuka:** Did it give you any nausea?   
**Maki:** My vision's spinning around\.\.\. I think I might be a little motion sick\.  
**Suzuka:** Ban-san, let's take a short break\.  
**Tsugumi:** I've finished recording the fight scene as we planned\.  
**Tsugumi:** This here is a sample of it\. Please watch over it to decide whether or not we should make a PV from it\.  
**Maki:** Sure, I'll give it a watch\. Thanks too; this was a good experience\.  
Several days later\.

  
**Yume:** This is so cool-\! It's like you onee-sans are really fighting around in Journey to the West\!  
**Yume:** And actually, that's no fair\! I want to do that too\! I want to film a whole bunch of me being cool\!  
**Maki:** Sure\. Then, next time, let's all do it\.
