## [Misogi - Kiyoka: Start\]: I'll Protect You\!
--This was something that happened on a mission a few months ago\.

  
**Kofuki:** This's the best\! There's aradama-chan whichever way you look\! I'm gonna cut 'em all up\!  
**Mirja:** Don't push ahead, Shichinosato Kofuki\!  
**Kofuki:** Shut up\! These're all mine\!  
**Mirja:** You're getting too excited\!  
**Mirja:** (Losing control of Shichinosato Kofuki will hurt us\. Asakura Mihono is\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** Geez, there's way too manyyy\! I chop one\.\.\. and another\.\.\. and there's just\.\.\. more\!  
**Mirja:** (She still has strength left\. What about Musumi Kiyoka?\)  
**Kiyoka:** [pant\.\.\. pant\.\.\.\!\]  
**Mirja:** (\.\.\.So Musumi Kiyoka is reaching her limit\.\)  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Could we talk for a moment, Setouchi Chie?  
**Chie:** \.\.\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Please listen to me, Setouchi Chie\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Eh-- Ah, what?  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono and I will move to concentrate the aradama around Shichinosato Kofuki\.  
**Mirja:** Please move with Musumi Kiyoka in a direction with less aradama\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.If that's the plan, then Kiyoka-chan and I will go with you\. The three of you can't handle this many aradama on your own\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.You and Musumi Kiyoka are showing heavy signs of fatigue\.  
**Mirja:** This is expected to be a lengthy mission\. So please recover your stamina for now\.  
**Mirja:** We can manage this fine\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Alright\. I'll look after Kiyoka-chan\.  
**Mirja:** I'll leave her to you\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Follow after me, Asakura Mihono\! We're taking out the aradama that escape from Shichinosato Kofuki\!  
**Mihono:** Okay\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\! HAAAAAAAAAAHHH\!\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.That should be the last of the aradama around here\.\.\. I think? Are you okay, Kiyoka-chan?  
**Kiyoka:** I'm almost exhausted from fighting on and on, but\.\.\. I didn't get hurt or anything\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.How do you think Hono-chan and them are doing?  
**Chie:** Mirja-san is with them, so I'm sure they're alright\. So, just rest a little\.\.\. When you get your energy back, we can go help them out, okay?  
**Kiyoka:** With all those aradama, we're probably going to have to fight some more\.\.\. Do you think we can meet up with them alright?  
**Chie:** Don't worry\. Your onee-san will keep you safe\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.When you say that, it feels like it'll really be okay\.  
**Chie:** But\.\.\. sorry\.\.\. right now\.\.\. I need some\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Chie-san?  
**Chie:** [pant\.\.\. pant\.\.\. pant\.\.\.\]  
**Kiyoka:** You're burning up\!?  
**Kiyoka:** (She was fighting like this\.\.\. Chie-san really is incredible\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.No, that's not it\. It's because I'm so weak\.\.\. Chie-san had to push herself so hard for me\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Ki\.\.\. yoka\.\.\. chan?  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Don't overwork yourself, Chie-san\. I'll try my best\.  
**Kiyoka:** Until we meet back up with the others\.\.\. I'll protect you\!  

## [Misogi - Kiyoka: End\]: A Little Confidence
**Kiyoka:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** Are you okay, Chie-san?  
**Chie:** Yes, thank you, Kiyoka-chan\.  
**Chie:** (But\.\.\. I can't keep going leaving everything to her\.\)  
**Chie:** Kiyoka-chan, thanks for protecting me\. I'm feeling better after a little rest, so I can fight too now\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Let me feel your forehead for a second\.  
**Chie:** Eh?  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Your hand feels nice and cool, Kiyoka-chan\.  
**Chie:** The reason it feels nice is because you still have a fever\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Ah\.  
**Kiyoka:** Do you understand? No matter what you say, Chie-san, I'm going to protect you until we meet up with everyone\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Are you listening\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.I am\. Then, please look after me, Kiyoka-chan\.  
**Kiyoka:** Please just rely on me\. I won't let them lay a finger on you\.  
**Aradama:** SHAAAAAAAA\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.HMPH\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Fufu\.  
**Chie:** (Having Kiyoka-chan protect me\.\.\. It makes me no good as an onee-san, but it also sort of gives me butterflies\.\)  
**Mihono:** Ah\! There's Kiyoka and Chii-nee\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, everyone\.\.\.\!  
**Mirja:** I'm glad to see the both of you are safe\. Setouchi Chie, how are you feeling?  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Could you tell I had a fever?  
**Mirja:** I can't tell that much\.  
**Mirja:** But, you were clearly responding sluggishly\. I decided something had to be wrong and focused the aradama on us\.  
**Mihono:** You had one\!? I didn't notice at all\!  
**Chie:** I'm your onee-san\. I can't go making you worry about me, can I?  
**Chie:** And, I had Kiyoka-chan making sure I was safe, so I was absolutely fine\.  
**Kiyoka:** [crying\]\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Kiyoka-chan\!? Why are you crying\!?  
**Kofuki:** Was it that scary being off alone with Chichie\!?  
**Kiyoka:** That's not it\.\.\. Since Chie-san wasn't feeling well, I-I had to protect her\.\.\. When it was over, I felt so relieved\.\.\. The tears won't\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Musumi Kiyoka\. You've done an excellent job\.  
**Mihono:** Thanks a bunch for keeping Chii-nee safe, Kiyoka\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Yeah\!

## [Furisode 21 - Mai: Start\]: Let's Make Our First Shrine Visit\!
**Mai:** By the way, do you all have any plans for New Year's?  
**Kaoru:** Just to sleep it off for now\.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru, if all you ever do is sleep, aren't you going to get fat? I'm planning on spending mine with my family\!  
**Ellen:** Or, I'd like to, but they're all busy, so it'll have to wait till after the first three days are over\.  
**Hiyori:** I haven't really made any plans in particular\.  
**Mai:** What about you, Kanami-chan, Sayaka-chan?  
**Sayaka:** I'm going to spend it at home with my family\.  
**Kanami:** I'm doing the same as Sayaka-chan\. Hey, since we're all together, want to do our first shrine visit together too?  
**Ellen:** Sounds good\! Let's do it in furisode\!  
**Kaoru:** Furisode?  
**Kaoru:** We don't really have to wear that stuff, do we? It's annoying\.  
**Ellen:** No\! That's no good, Kaoru\! If we're doing it, we all have to wear furisode\!  
**Mai:** I think I agree with Ellen-chan\. I'd like to make our first shrine visit all wearing furisode together\.  
**Sayaka:** I don't have a furisode\.  
**Mai:** Eh?  
**Kanami:** I don't think I've got one either\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Same here\. It's not that big a deal if we don't wear one, is it?  
**Ellen:** No way\! I want everybody wearing one\!  
**Kaoru:** How old are you\!  
**Mai:** Ahaha\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** In that case, how about this\! I'll get furisode for everybody\!  
**Hiyori:** Is that how badly you want us to wear them\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Ah, hang on, Ellen-chan\. Won't it be hard for you to prepare enough for everyone?  
**Mai:** I think I have one at home that should fit Sayaka-chan's size\. I might have one that fits Kaoru-chan too\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** It's fine; Ellen'll get one for me\.  
**Mai:** Okay\.  
**Ellen:** That's that then\!  
**Sayaka:** Thanks, Mai\.  
**Mai:** It's fine; this much is nothing\. I'm looking forward to our first shrine visit\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm\.  

## [Furisode 21 - Mai: End\]: Please Make it Happen\!
The day of their first shrine visit\.

  
**Mai:** Alright then, let's make our visit\.  
**Ellen:** What's everybody going to pray for?  
**Kaoru:** I did a lot of thinking, but I'm going with: "Give me a break\."  
**Ellen:** Did you really do a lot of thinking for that?  
**Kaoru:** Course I did-\.  
**Kaoru:** I came up with a bunch of other stuff, like, "Bring down divine punishment on the president", or "Make it so all my traveling is in first class\."  
**Kaoru:** What'd you come up with anyway?  
**Ellen:** "For lots of fun things to happen\!"  
**Mai:** That sounds like you, Ellen-chan\.  
**Hiyori:** We just get dragged along all the time though\.  
**Ellen:** Still, isn't that fun too, Hiyoyon?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Well, sometimes\.  
**Kanami:** So for me, I'll pray\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** To fight against tough opponents, right? You don't even have to say it\.  
**Kanami:** Close\!  
**Kanami:** The correct answer was, to fight people from schools of swordfighting I've never fought against before\!  
**Kaoru:** Nah, that's the same thing\.  
**Kanami:** Eh, is it?  
**Mai:** What are you going to pray for, Sayaka-chan?  
**Sayaka:** I'll\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Ah, we're the next ones up\!  
**Mai:** It's our turn\. Tell me after we pay our visit, okay?  
**Sayaka:** Okay\.  
**Mai:** (\.\.\.Our prayers\. Mine is, next year, for all of us to\.\.\.\)  
**Kaoru:** Alllright, that's over with\! Let's get something to eat\.  
**Kanami:** Is anywhere open on New Year's?  
**Ellen:** I know a great place we can go\!  
**Mai:** Fufu, they all look like they're enjoying this\.  
**Sayaka:** Mai, about before\. I prayed for all of us to come make our first shrine visit together again next year\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** Mai?  
**Mai:** You just surprised me a little, is all\. I prayed for the same thing as you\.  
**Hiyori:** Mai\! Sayaka\! What are you doing; we'll leave you behind\!  
**Mai:** Let's get going, Sayaka-chan\.  
**Sayaka:** Okay, Mai\.

## [Summer Dress - Sanae: Start\]: The Rain Comes Down
**Aradama:** GYAOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!  
**Sanae:** Konohana-san\! I cornered the aradama\!  
**Sanae:** Please finish it off\!  
**Suzuka:** You can leave it to me\!  
**Suzuka:** HAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Aradama:** OOoo\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** This was the last of them now\. You did well, Iwakura-san\.  
**Sanae:** Thank you\. You did well too, Konohana-san\.  
**Sanae:** We finished our mission before the rain started\.\.\.  
**Sanae:** \.\.\.Ah\.  
**Sanae:** It's pouring now\.  
**Suzuka:** Our expedition to Hokkaido coincided with the typhoon passing\. There's little we could do about it\.  
**Suzuka:** Let''s hurry on to our hotel before anything\. If we stay here in the rain like this, we'll catch a cold\.  
**Sanae:** Alright\!  
**Sanae:** Oh, the rain stopped\.  
**Suzuka:** Yes, the weather's nice out\.  
**Suzuka:** Are you feeling a cold coming on, Iwakura-san?  
**Sanae:**　I feel fine\.  
**Sanae:** It's all because of the plan you came up with, Konohana-san\. If we had been chasing down aradama in that rain, I might have caught one\.  
**Suzuka:** Really now, even without my strategy, I think you would have been able to suppress them quickly enough\.  
**Sanae:** Are you sure\.\.\.?  
**Suzuka:** What do you doubt about that?  
**Sanae:** It's just, with my skills, I'm not sure I'd be able to beat them in time\.  
**Sanae:** I'd probably still be out there even after the rain started\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** (She's sincerely concerned\.\.\. What a straightforward person\. Come to think of it, Iwakura-san is also from Heijou\.\)  
**Suzuka:** Fufu\.  
**Sanae:** ? \.\.\.What's the matter?  
**Suzuka:** Oh, it's nothing\.  
**Suzuka:** Anyway, before we stop in for the night, would you like to step out for a bit? We did manage to finish our mission earlier than planned\.  
**Sanae:** Ah, I'd love to\!  
**Sanae:** Since we came to Hokkaido, I was thinking I could try some of the jingisukan here, or their ice cream, or the seafood\!  
**Suzuka:** Well now, it's all food\.  
**Sanae:** Actually\.\.\. Whenever I have time on an expedition assignment, I go on a gourmet tour\.  
**Suzuka:** I think that's a fine interest to have\. In that case, could I ask you to escort me around?  
**Sanae:** Sure\! Leave it to me\!

## [Summer Dress - Sanae: End\]: Looking Good With Sunflowers
**Sanae:** I found it, Konohana-san\! That store's ramen is famous for its deliciousness\!  
**Suzuka:** Ramen?  
**Sanae:** Yeah\!  
**Sanae:** When it comes to noodles, I think mizusawa udon is the best, but I love ramen too\!  
**Sanae:** Every region does it pretty differently, so it's interesting to see\.  
**Suzuka:** What sort of ramen do they have in Hokkaido?  
**Sanae:** Miso ramen's definitely the most popular in Hokkaido, but they make tasty seafood flavored shio ramen too\!  
**Suzuka:** I'll look forward to it\.  
**Suzuka:** The ramen was delicious\.  
**Sanae:** Wasn't it? I wasn't sure what to pick first, but I made the right choice with shio ramen\.  
**Suzuka:** As a token of my thanks for the ramen, I'll show you to a place I recommend\.   
**Sanae:** Somewhere you recommend?  
**Suzuka:** That's right\.  
**Suzuka:** I thought I could also at least find one place to bring you, so I kept a special one in mind\.  
**Sanae:** Woww\.\.\. It's so pretty here\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** I'm glad to see it's to your liking\.  
**Sanae:** Why did you choose here\.\.\.?  
**Suzuka:** It fit the image I have of you, Iwakura-san\.  
**Suzuka:** Sunflowers do suit you after all\.  
**Sanae:** Sunflowers suit me\.\.\.?  
**Suzuka:** They do\. Sunflowers are a good fit for a toji with a straightforward, honest strength\.  
**Sanae:** \.\.\.Thank you\.  
**Sanae:** But, sunflowers really do suit you too, Konohana-san\.  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, that would be nice\.  
**Suzuka:** Anyway, it's about time we left\.  
**Sanae:** Ah, for the shinkansen?  
**Suzuka:** No, for the flight I chartered\. This will be faster than taking the shinkansen, won't it?  
**Sanae:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Th-That's true\.  
**Sanae:** (Instead of sunflowers\.\.\. maybe a more expensive flower would be better for Konohana-san\.\)  
**Suzuka:** What are you waiting for? We're going\.  
**Sanae:** R-Right\.\.\.

## [Race Queen - Mirja: Start\]: A Favor
**Yui:** My intuition's telling me she should be around here\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Ah, found her\! Miiirja-saaan\~\!  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui? As well as\.\.\.  
**Morishita Kihiro:** Really-, we've been looking all over for you\! Miss Kitora\!  
**Haji Keiko:** H-Hello\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Morishita Kihiro and Haji Keiko\. You three make a rare group\.  
**Kihiro:** You might be right there\!  
**Kihiro:** Though, despite myself coming from the equipment department and Miss Haji from the engineering preparatory department, we've long since deepened our friendship\!  
**Keiko:** Eh\!?  
**Kihiro:** But you're right that we have little in common with Miss Yamashiro here\! \.\.\.What seems to be the matter, Miss Haji?  
**Keiko:** I-It's\.\.\. nothing\.  
**Keiko:** (Deepened\.\.\. our friendship\.\.\.?\)  
**Mirja:** So then, did you need me for something?  
**Yui:** Yes\! Though, I'm not really the one looking for you; that's these two\!  
**Kihiro:** What are you saying, Miss Yamashiro\! With you offering your assistance, we're all of one heart and mind\!  
**Kihiro:** In short\! The three of us have one common cause\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Haji Keiko, please give me the essentials\.  
**Keiko:** R-Right\.\.\. Actually, we were thinking we wanted you to help with our assignment, Kitora-san\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Your assignment?  
**Kihiro:** As a matter of fact, we've been assigned to build one motorcycle\!  
**Kihiro:** Soon enough, we'll be unveiling it to the public-- but as reasons go, we're lacking staff on that day\! We'd very much like your help, Miss Kitora\!  
**Mirja:** I'm not against helping you, but, sadly, I don't know much about motorcycles\.  
**Mirja:** Why not ask someone more suited for this? Someone like Inago Akira should be up to the task\.  
**Yui:** Actually, we asked Boss, but she couldn't make it\.\.\.  
**Yui:** You're the only one we can turn to, Mirja-san\!  
**Yui:** And anyway, what we're missing is someone to help draw in visitors, so it's not like you even need to know about motorcycles\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**All 3:** Please help us\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Fine then\. If you're that set on it, I'll help you out\.  
**Yui:** Hooray-\! This is why I love you, Mirja-san\!  
**Mirja:** Morishita Kihiro, Haji Keiko\. Could you give me a specific schedule for the event?  
**Kihiro:** Sure thing\! We're glad to have you, Miss Kitora\! Really, what a stroke of luck, Miss Haji\!  
**Keiko:** Y-Yes\.\.\. But, err\.\.\. No, it is lucky\.\.\.  
**Kihiro:** We've done it, Miss Haji\! Now we're 100% prepared for the unveiling\!  
**Keiko:** Um, but\.\.\. Is this really okay? I feel like we didn't tell her the important part\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Don't worry about it, Keiko-san\! We don't have to tell her about "that" until just before we start\!  
**Yui:** Mufufu\~\! Ahh\~, now I don't know how I'll wait for the day after tomorrow\~\!  
**Keiko:** (Is this really fine\.\.\.?\)  

## [Race Queen - Mirja: End\]: Day of the Unveiling
**Yui:** Mirja-san\! Can I be next to you on the way there? You don't mind, right\!  
**Mirja:** Do what you want\.  
**Mirja:** More importantly, Morishita Kihiro\. Let's go over once more what will happen when we get there\.  
**Mirja:** Firstly, as I'm in charge of reaching out to visitors\.\.\.  
**Kihiro:** Ahh, we lied about that\.  
**Mirja:** Huh?  
**Yui:** Hey\!? It's too soon to spill the beans\!\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Too soon to spill the beans\. And what do you mean by that, Yamashiro Yui?  
**Yui:** Well, uh, we didn't lie so much, Mirja-san\. Loosely speaking, we do want you attracting visitors\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Haji Keiko?  
**Keiko:** M-Me\!?  
**Kihiro:** Please don't glare at Miss Haji like that, Miss Kitora\. She was saying we should give a proper explanation until the bitter end\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Right, I think I have an idea of what's going on\. Yamashiro Yui is behind this, isn't she?  
**Yui:** Teheh\.  
**Mirja:** "Teheh" doesn't make up for this\.  
**Kihiro:** To give a perfectly crisp and clear explanation, we'd like you to be a race queen for us, Miss Kitora\!  
**Mirja:** A\.\.\. race queen\.  
**Mirja:** So, what are you making me wear?  
**Yui:** Ehehe\! Take a look, Mirja-san\! This is it\!  
**Mirja:** To sum it up\.\.\. I wear this, sit on the motorcycle, and attract people\.\.\.  
**Kihiro:** As a staff member attracting visitors in the broadest sense, you're our billboard\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.  
**Keiko:** I-I'm sorry\.\.\. We were actually going to hire a professional to do this\.\.\.  
**Kihiro:** You see, while building the motorcycle, my gen\~ius instincts went and caught fire\.  
**Kihiro:** And, while remodeling here and there, we completely spent through our budget\.  
**Yui:** That's when I happened to hear about all this, and thought, why not ask Mirja-san?  
**Yui:** With your bombshell body, there's no way you wouldn't look great in it\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Unbelievable\.  
**Keiko:** Um\.\.\. Are you not going to do it afer all\.\.\.?  
**Mirja:** No, I will\. I wouldn't turn you down after coming this far\. I'm not happy about it, but all I can do is resign myself to this\.\.\.  
**Cameraman:** Excuse me-\. Would you mind giving a look over this way-?  
**Mirja:** Li\.\.\. like this?  
**Cameraman:** Thanks a lot\! That's perfect\!  
**Man:** Hey, check out the cowling on that bike\.\.\.\! The design, materials, functionality; they're all first rate\.  
**Woman:** I can tell\. And, the parts used here\.\.\.\! That's an interesting make, but what purpose does it serve? Hmm, I'd really like to find out\.  
**Kihiro:** Mmhm\! Just as we'd planned, Miss Haji\! Our motorcycle is the center of attention\!  
**Kihiro:** Now then\! Let's hurry over and give our guests an explanation\!  
**Keiko:** Right\.\.\.\! I'm very glad, that we worked so hard on this assignment\.\.\.\!  
Mirja： (\.\.\.From the sound of it, this motorcycle has incredible workmanship\. That at least makes it worth me enduring the shame of dressing as a race queen\.\)

  
**Mirja:** (Though--\)  
**Yui:** Hey, Mirja-saan\~\! Could you look over my way too\~\! And be extra sexy for me, please\~\!  
**Mirja:** (Sigh\.\.\. Instead of guiding visitors, Yamashiro Yui is just enjoying herself\. I'll have to lecture her thoroughly later\.\.\.\)
