## [Renpu High: Start\]: Marshmallows
**Minato:** Yukari, Kagari, morning-\!  
**Yukari:** Morning, Minato\.  
**Kagari:** Good morning\.  
**Minato:** You gotta hear this\! Last night, I had this awesome dream-\! In my dream, we were all a part of the tournament\.\.\.  
**Minato:** But the white gravel at the tournament grounds had all turned into marshmallows, so we couldn't do it, and then we just decided to eat them all\!  
**Kagari:** Sigh\.\.\. I shouldn't be surprised, Minato-senpai\. Even your dreams don't make any sense\.\.\.  
**Minato:** I mean, it was such a crazy dream that I felt like I had to tell you as soon as possible\! You know how it is, right? Hey, Yukari, what kinda dream did you have last night?  
**Yukari:** My dream last night\.\.\. I think I had one\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** Ah\.\.\.\!  
**Kagari:** Yukari-sama? What is it?  
**Yukari:** It's nothing\. Look, school is starting\. Let's go to our classrooms\.  
**Minato:** What that was about\. Yukari was acting a little weird, wasn't she?  
**Kagari:** Was she? Anyway, if we don't hurry, we'll be late\. Really now, this is all your fault for launching into some long and pointless story about your dreams, Minato-senpai\.\.\.  
**Minato:** Sorry about that\. But still, wouldn't it be funny if that dream ended up coming true\~?  
In a break between classes\.

  
**Minato:** Ah\~, I'm starving\. I can't believe it's still only 2nd period\.  
**Yukari:** Minato\. So you were over here\.  
**Minato:** Yeah, I was hungry, so I thought I'd buy some bread from the school store\. Why're you here, Yukari?  
**Yukari:** No reason, really\. We have music class next, don't we? Let's go together\.  
**Minato:** O-Okay\.\.\.  
After school that day\.

  
**Minato:** Ah\~, I can't be bothered today, so maybe I'll skip practice and take an afternoon nap\.  
**Yukari:** Minato, you came out here to skip practice again\.\.\.  
**Minato:** Sorry about that, Yukari\. I'll try extra hard in practice starting tomorrow, so give everyone my regards\~\!  
**Yukari:** Wait\. If you won't be coming to practice, I'll do self-training at my household too, so let's leave together\.  
**Minato:** Eh-- You will\!?  
**Kagari:** What's going on, Yukari-sama? You're skipping practice along with Minato-senpai?  
**Yukari:** There's no real reason for it\. I just thought it would be nice for us to walk home together for once\. Come on, Kagari, Minato\. Let's go\.  
**Kagari:** There's something strange about Yukari-sama today, isn't there?  
**Minato:** That's what I'm saying\. It always feels like I'm the one sticking close to Yukari, but today it's like it's the other way around\.\.\. I wonder what happened\.\.\. Nn-, I wanna know\!

## [Renpu High: End\]: Dream Come True
**Minato:** Ahh\~, the three of us skipping practice and going home together feels all fresh and exciting\! Want to stop by somewhere?  
**Kagari:** Yukari-sama and I will be practicing as soon as we return to the Origami household\. Please don't treat us like your accomplices, Minato-senpai\.  
**Minato:** Come on, don't be such a stick in the mud\~\. We never go home early together\! There's this super cool secret spot I found that I'll show you\.  
**Yukari:** Secret spot? And where is that?  
**Minato:** You'll have to wait and see\. C'mon, let's go\!  
**Minato:** You two are so slow\~\. If you keep it up, the sun's gonna go down\~\!  
**Kagari:** Pant, pant\. You're taking us up quite the mountain trail\.  
**Yukari:** Minato, can't we leave it at this and go home for today? I have a strange feeling about this\.  
**Minato:** Hey, Yukari, what's this feeling about anyway? You've been acting kinda weird since this morning\. Come on and tell us\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.  
**Minato:** If you just explain things, I'll hear you out, okay?  
**Yukari:** I might just be getting afraid over nothing, but, this morning, I had a strange dream\.  
**Yukari:** Up in a mountain, there was this mysterious shrine I had never seen before\. You went running up the steps to it, Minato\.\.\. And then, the moment I took my eyes off you, you vanished\.  
**Kagari:** As in\.\.\. She was spirited away?  
**Yukari:** I can't say that for sure, but I woke up with this feeling of unease, and it's worrying me\.  
**Minato:** Alright, I get it now\! It's true that, unlike my dream, this one sounds like it could actually happen\.  
**Kagari:** Minato-senpai, given what Yukari-sama is saying, can we not stop here today and go back?  
**Minato:** Hmm, you have a point\. If Yukari's that sure about it\.\.\.   
**Minato:** I know\! Won't everything be fine if I just don't go on ahead like I did in Yukari's dream?  
**Minato:** I'll stay right with you every step of the way, alright? Since we already came this far, you'll definitely be missing out if you don't see it now\! Okay?  
**Yukari:** If you insist, Minato\.\.\. Fine then, let's go see\.  
**Minato:** You've got to\! Don't worry; so long as the three of us are together, no matter where we go, we'll make it through\!  
**Minato:** Okaaay, here we are\!  
**Yukari:** This is\.\.\.  
**Kagari:** I didn't think cherry blossoms could still be in bloom somewhere at this time of season\.\.\.  
**Minato:** This place is hidden away on the north side of the mountain, so it doesn't get much sun, which means the cherry blossoms bloom later than usual\.  
**Yukari:** I'm surprised you managed to find a place like this\.  
**Minato:** I saw it in a dream I had\. There were all these cherry blossoms blooming on the north side of a mountain\. So I got interested, and when I came to check it out, I found this\!  
**Kagari:** You mean, your dream came true then?  
**Minato:** Yep\. If Yukari's dream came true, that'd be scary, but I'm glad a fun dream like this one was real\!  
**Yukari:** That's for sure\. I hope we can be spared Minato getting spirited away or the gravel turning to marshmallows, but I'm very glad to see a dream like this come true\.
