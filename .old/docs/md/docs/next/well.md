3\.5 years ago, I translated the first ten chapters of the story for practice and fun\. I'd never done anything remotely on that scale before\. I did about 5 editing checks (one just for Kofuki's dialogue to figure out how rude to get with it\)\. And in the end, I sat for a day or two unsure if I should even post the translations or just file them away never to be seen again\. 

  
I knew I'd made mistakes\. I didn't know if I could commit to this\. I could never have even guessed I'd still be doing this after all this time\. But I loved the anime more than anything, and the threads are part of what made it so memorable\. I wanted to give back to you all\. So I hit post\. I've never regretted it\.

  
The past year or so has been frustrating and depressing for me\. A lot's been going on personally, as I'm sure isn't unique to anybody\. Tojitomo helped me get away from it all\. The series is truly something special in my heart, something I didn't think could impact me so much after a decade of keeping up with the medium\. I'm glad this fanbase persisted, as small as it is\. I was especially happy when defenselessperson started uploading everything to Youtube\. It's how I wanted to do this to begin with, if I were a little more competent\. And Toji no Miko deserved to reach more people\.

  
But this also dragged me down at times\. I always said I did this for my own satisfaction, but I grew increasingly frustrated with my own work lately\. Call it growing pains maybe\. I could never be satisfied with how to express things, stupid mistakes ate me up, and I'd be consumed with feelings of pointlessness\. If I'm being honest, I often asked myself how many people really cared\. I tried to ignore it, but I think you can tell it began affecting my update schedule\. Even managing the art collection started feeling draining\.

  
Somehow though, this doesn't hurt as much as I thought it would\. Maybe I was resigned to it\. It's not like the signs weren't there\. Or maybe it's because I have hopes the franchise as a whole will outlive this\. As passionate as I am about Toji no Miko, I know other fans have contributed so much it's hard to wrap my head around\. I know some of the official creators would make it their life work if they could\. They'll do what they can to keep it going\.

  
I'll stay on\. I'd love to translate the reading play\. And there's some personal projects I always wanted to work on\. I do owe a re-subbing of the OVA\. And I always toyed with the idea of an in-depth analysis of the anime, maybe even complete with re-subbing that too as I work through it\. There's also a few pixiv fanfics that are surprisingly high quality, if you'll trust me on that\.

  
These are some long-term goals though\. I can't make any promises\. I'm sorry about all this\. But thank you for being there\.
