==================================

## [Misogi - Akira: Start\]: New Recruit
**Makoto:** I have something I'd like you to be in charge of, Akira-chan\. Please join this toji on an aradama suppression mission\.  
**Akira:** Fine by me, but, who's this chick? Don't think she's with us, is she?  
**Makoto:** President Maniwa introduced her to me the other day\.  
**Makoto:** Her name is\.\.\. Nitta Hirona\. Her okatana is the Mizuguchi Rapier\.  
**Makoto:** She's another victim of Origami Yukari\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Hmm\. You're asking me to go cause you want me to test her?  
**Akira:** Think there's something sketchy with her?  
**Makoto:** I did an investigation, though nothing came up\.  
**Makoto:** But\.\.\. I want to know, as a person, can we put our faith in her\. That's why I want you there\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.That's a big job\. Just leave her to me, Makocchan\.  
**Akira:** (That's what I told her, but\.\.\.\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Akira:** (Ever since we met up, she's just been standing around staring at nothing\. Is she\.\.\. actually gonna be able to handle her own with aradama?\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.? Is something wrong?  
**Akira:** You sure you're up for this? Think you'll be able to take out some aradama?  
**Hirona:** I'll be fiine\.  
**Hirona:** Though, strangely, I do get told a lot I should consider changing departments\.  
**Akira:** Probably cause you getting hurt on their watch'd give them trouble sleeping at night\.  
**Hirona:** Are you sure? Every unit I was assigned to always had their results improved though?  
**Akira:** Did they really? You sure they weren't fudging the numbers?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Fudging?  
**Akira:** I'm asking if you're just making shit up\!  
**Akira:** (Seriously, for somebody who keeps blanking out, she's weirdly in your face\.\)  
**Akira:** (But whatever, it's good she's not spooked by me\. Yeah, seems like she's got guts\.\)  
**Hirona:** I confirmed where the aradama are\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.What do you wanna do?  
**Hirona:** A surprise attack would be efficient\.  
**Akira:** (Didn't even hesitate\.\.\. That's good\.\)  
**Akira:** Cool, let's go with that then\.  
**Hirona:** Okaaay\.  
**Akira:** (Alright, now show me how you handle yourself\.\)  

## [Misogi - Akira: End\]: Nitta Hirona
**Hirona:** YAH\!  
**Aradama:** oooo\.\.\.  
**Akira:** That Mizuguchi Rapier\.\.\. You sure can fight with that thing\.  
**Hirona:** Everyone says that\. So\.\.\. the next one\!  
**Akira:** (She's not bad\.\.\. maybe better than Yuuki?\)  
**Akira:** (Well, it's enough if she can do that much\. Yuuki could use a practice partner\.\)  
**Akira:** (Though I'd love it if she were just a bit more capable\. But now's not really the time to be getting picky\.\)  
**Aradama:** GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Akira:** --\!?  
**Akira:** This one's\.\.\. Oi\! You can back off\! I'll take this one myself\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Inago-san, do you watch sports?  
**Akira:** The hell are you going on about now\!?  
**Hirona:** In baseball, they don't throw with the same strength at the top of the batting order as they do at the bottom\. In soccer, they don't run at full sprint the whole time\.  
**Hirona:** I think they play keeping the effort required in mind\.  
**Akira:** Oi\!\! Would you listen to me already--  
**Hirona:**ã€€And I think that can work for toji too\. Regulating effort depending on the opponent\.  
**Hirona:** With all that in mind, if they're strong, I'll put in everything\.\.\.\!\!  
**Aradama:** GUOHhh\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Wha\!? How the hell'd you move like that\!? Were you holding that back this whole time\!?  
**Hirona:** You can call it regulating effort\. I was just weighing the cost and benefits\.  
**Hirona:** Though\.\.\. It does sound slightly cool the way you said it\.  
**Akira:** Hah-\! You're pretty damn funny\!  
**Hirona:** Does this mean I passed your test?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.What makes you think that?  
**Hirona:** Someone as skilled as you paired with a beginner like me\. And also, the aradama we were assigned to defeat weren't strong enough to need someone like you here, Inago-san\.  
**Hirona:** Which means there's some other reason for it, isn't there? Otherwise there's no benefit to you being here\.  
**Akira:** (She figured it all out, and that attitude\.\.\. Pretty good\! I'm starting to like her\!\)  
**Akira:** Yeah, you passed\. No complaints from me\. We'd be glad to have ya, Hirona\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Please take care of mee\.  

## [Misogi - Hirona: Start\]: Cooking With No Regard for Efficiency
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Makoto-san, Akira-san\. Could you teach me how to cook?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Huh?  
**Akira:** You want me teaching you how to cook? I get why you'd ask Makocchan, but\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Ah, you're just for taste testing, Akira-saan\. It's more cost-effective asking you from the start\.  
**Akira:** Oh, so that's why\.  
**Makoto:** I wouldn't mind teaching you how to cook, though\.\.\. I thought you didn't have any interest in cooking for yourself, Hirona-san\.\.\.?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.That's right, it's a waste of effort to cook for myself\.  
**Hirona:** I think it's much better to have somebody else cook tasty food for me\.  
**Hirona:** But, there's a reason I want to cook a meal myself this time\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** What would that be?  
**Hirona:** Yuuki-san told me she wanted to try eating food I made\.  
**Akira:** You're real soft when it comes to Yuuki, aren't ya\.  
**Hirona:** My sense of efficiency doesn't apply for Yuuki-san, so I put in all my effort for her\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.That doesn't go for you though, Akira-san\.  
**Akira:** Didn't ask\.  
**Akira:** But hey, didja know Yuuki'll do anything I tell her? Hmm? You jealous?  
**Hirona:** Gununununu\.\.\. I'm extremely jealouss\.  
**Akira:** Ahaha\! I win this one\!  
**Makoto:** That's enough fooling around, you two\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Yuuki-san does almost anything Makoto-san asks too, doesn't she\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Ehh\!?  
**Hirona:** It makes me jealouss\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Look what you did to Hirona, Makocchan\.  
**Makoto:** Ehh\!? But, I can't make a comeback like Akira-chan can\!?  
**Makoto:** I'll make sure to teach you cooking, alright\!  
**Akira:** There ya go\.  
**Hirona:** I guess that's fine\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.Honestly, don't go teasing me like that, okay?  
**Hirona:** I meant it seriously when I said I was jealous, so please forgive me\.  
**Hirona:** Ah, but I'll get revenge on Akira-san\. You have to taste test until you get sick\.  
**Akira:** Fine by me, but do me a favor and at least make it edible\.  
**Hirona:** I'll do what I cann\.  

## [Misogi - Hirona: End\]: Greatest Efficiency
**Hirona:** I already knew, but\.\.\. she's skilled with her hands\.  
**Akira:** I mean, Makocchan's been cooking since forever\.  
**Hirona:** It's unusual for Makoto-san to be so good at cooking when she comes from such a wealthy family\.  
**Akira:** What started it was\.\.\. I guess it's kinda like you\. Her mom was real busy, and she wanted her to have something good to eat\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I never did meet the previous head of the Hitakami family\.  
**Akira:** She was really nice\. Back then, Makocchan's cooking sucked too, and\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** What are you two talking about?  
**Akira:** Just how you used to suck at cooking\.  
**Makoto:** Well of course I wasn't any good at first\.  
**Makoto:** Here, Hirona-san\. I'm finished with my example\. Now you should try doing it yourself\.  
**Hirona:** Okaaay\. I'll tryy\.  
**Makoto:** So, now that I've had you try making it\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Hey, it's good enough, right? You could serve this just fine\.  
**Makoto:** Yes, I think it's rather good too\. If you can make this, you shouldn't need me teaching you\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** No, this won't work\.  
**Akira:** Huh? What's the problem?  
**Hirona:** It doesn't taste the same as Makoto-san's\.  
**Akira:** Well duh, course it doesn't\.  
**Akira:** You started cooking like an hour ago; if you could make it taste the same, what'd that say about Makocchan? Yuuki just wants to eat your food; this'll be fine\.  
**Hirona:** But, if mine tastes worse than Makoto-san's, couldn't she eat Makoto-san's cooking instead?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.You can be a real pain in the ass, y'know\.  
**Hirona:** When it comes to Yuuki-san, I ignore the cost-benefits\.  
**Hirona:** What should I do, Makoto-san?  
**Makoto:** Let's see\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** I know; how about this?  
**Yuuki:** Just you wait, nee-samas\! We'll get some delicious udon ready for you\! Right, Hirona-san\!  
**Hirona:** I'll do my beeest\.  
**Akira:** Nice thinking, having them cook together\.  
**Makoto:** This way Yuuki-chan will surely be happy\.  
**Yuuki:** Hirona-san, you're not kneading it hard enough\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I'm not? Can you show me how?  
**Yuuki:** You do it\.\.\. like this\!  
**Hirona:** Like\.\.\. this? You're amazing at this, Yuuki-san\.  
**Yuuki:** Ehehe, thanks\!  
**Hirona:** (It's not exactly my cooking, but\.\.\. it's making Yuuki-san smile, so this is the greatest efficiency\.\)  

## [Another - Kanami: Start\]: No Matter When, Never Skip Training\!
This is a fragmentary vision as shown by a strange aradama, down a path Etou Kanami might have taken\.

  
**Mihono:** Kanami's gone and I wanna find her\!  
**Mihono:** But\.\.\. I can't just give up all my missions either; what do I do, Mai?  
**Mihono:** Back then\.\.\. when Kanami came and helped us out, I knew I should have done whatever it took to bring her back\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Mm\. I know exactly how you feel\.  
**Mai:** But, right now, I don't think we can do anything but look for her while finishing our missions\. There's been a few cases where aradama disappeared before toji got there, so maybe\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** You think it could be Kanami doing it\!?  
**Mai:** I do\. So let's find out more about it little by little, okay Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** Alright\. I think Juujou-san's coming up with something too, so we'll just have to do what we can\.  
Having separated herself from everyone, Kanami was now--

  
**Kanami:** Hmph--\! Hah--\! Yah--\!  
**Kanami:** Mm\. My body really does feel lighter\.  
**Kanami:** It's pretty fun when you can tell all the training you're doing's paying off\.  
**Kanami:** Wonder if I can use an even higher level of hachimanriki by now\. I can use it for longer too\.  
**Kanami:** And, if I tried putting everything I've got into jin'i, I could probably go deeper than I've ever gone before\.  
**Kanami:** Though it'd be pretty bad if I ended up in the netherworld and couldn't come back\.\.\. so I don't think I'll be trying anytime soon\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\!  
**Kanami:** There's that weird feeling again, like ripples in water\. There's an aradama close by\.  
**Kanami:** (Lately, it's been like I can see the world around me so clearly\. Or maybe, it's more like I can feel it?\)  
**Aradama:** GGGGIIIII\!  
**Kanami:** Ah, there really was one here\. You can't go running wild all over, alright?  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.\!  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.uuu\.  
**Kanami:** It happened again\. Sometimes, when I get close to aradama, they get all quiet and calm down\. But why though?  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** When they get like this, even if they're aradama, it's pretty hard for me to cut them down and exorcise them\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** It doesn't look like it's going to be aggressive anymore, so maybe it's fine now\. It's weak enough that spectrum finders probably wouldn't pick it up either\.  
**Toji's Voice:** The aradama should be just up ahead\.  
**Kanami:** Ah-- Somebody's here on a mission\.\.\.\! Crap, I've gotta hide\.\.\.\!  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.The hell; there's no aradama-chan anywhere\! You sure this was the right place?  
**Tsugumi:** The coordinates point to right here, but maybe it moved elsewhere\.\.\. Though, even the spectrum reading's disappeared\. That's odd\.  
**Kofuki:** Forget it; I'm just gonna go find it already\!  
**Tsugumi:** Please try not running off on your own-\. Sorry about her, could you all follow after Shichinosato-san?  
**Kanami:** (Sorry everyone\.\.\.\)  
**Kanami:** (You've got a job to do, and it just gets more complicated if you can't find the aradama\.\.\. I'll have to be more careful\.\)  

## [Another - Kanami: End\]: Looking Back to a Familiar Voice
**Aradama:** GSSHAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Kanami:** I'll purify you right away, okay\. --HAHH\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Phew\.  
**Kanami:** Training up here in the caves and mountains has totally turned into an everyday thing for me, huh\. Though, I run into aradama like this sometimes\.  
**Kanami:** It's not so bad, living like this\. I just wish I'd explained things to Mai-chan and Mihono-chan\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** (That was\.\.\. I think it was about half a year ago now\. When I beat those aradama they were having a hard time with--\)  
**Mai:** Don't go, Kanami-chan\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah, we spent all this time looking for you\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.I'm sorry\.  
**Kanami:** I'm definitely\.\.\. making them worry about me\.  
**Kanami:** (Even if I did tell them why I ran away, I wasn't sure I could explain it all that well back then\.\)  
**Kanami:** (I can kind of understand why the people in the government would think my powers are dangerous\.\)  
**Kanami:** (I get why there'd be people out there afraid these toji powers could be used on something besides aradama\.\)  
**Kanami:** (I wouldn't have considered it myself, but hearing that sort of made sense\.\)  
**Kanami:** (If I'm around, then everyone from them to Akane-sama and Yukari-sama might get caught up in all kinds of trouble\.\)  
**Kanami:** (--When I kept thinking like that, at some point I just wanted to forget everything and do nothing but swordfighting\.\)  
**Kanami:** I wanted to be free to keep doing this, exorcising aradama and polishing my skills\.\.\. but I still don't know if it's the right thing to do\.  
**Kanami:** For now, I'd better get today's shopping taken care of\.  
**Kanami:** Thanks for always giving me some extras\.  
**Clerk:** Don't mention it\. Kanami-chan, you go camping up that mountain a lot, don't you?  
**Kanami:** Uh, yeah\. I'm camping there\.\.\. or something like that\.  
**Clerk:** Did you ever see anything like a tengu or god of the mountain up there?  
**Kanami:** Eh\!? Is that a thing?  
**Clerk:** From what folks say, it's thanks to something like that that the aradama round here disappeared\.  
**Kanami:** (Wait\.\.\. are they talking about me?\)  
**Kanami:** A-Ahaha\.\.\. I guess that explains it\.\.\.  
**Clerk:** Toji come by here less and less on missions too, so there's got to be something to it\.  
**Kanami:** I-I hope I get to see that tengu someday-\. Ahaha\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Who'd have thought they'd start talking about me like I'm a tengu\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** I got all the tings I need, so I'll just stay up here for a while\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Now my usual routine\.\.\. First to let your mind be one\. Cast off the teachings of the art of war, drink of the river Xi\.\.\. Let nothing be in your heart, and be one with nature\.\.\.		[Kanami is directly quoting teachings in Yagyu-ryu, signifying becoming one with the world\.\]  
**Kanami:** And then, 10,000 practice swings\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Found you\. \.\.\.Seeing you still just swordfighting even out here; in a way, it's actually a relief\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Hiyori-chan\!
