## 1: The Type I'm No Good With
**Mimi:** Hirona-onee-san\! Come play with Mimi-\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Sigh, this again\. [muttered\]  
**Mimi:** Huh? Maybe she didn't hear me? Are your ears feeling stuffed up? Hey, Hirona-onee-san?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I can hear youuu\.  
**Mimi:** I'm glad you can hear me then\!  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Sigh\. Because of Kagami-san, I haven't been able to do things according to plan lately\.\)  
**Mimi:** Hey hey hey hey\! Come play with Mimi, Hirona-onee-san\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** (Why exactly is she so attached to me\.\.\. It's not like I did anything with her\.\.\. Hmm\.\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I have an aradama suppression mission today, so we can't play\.  
**Mimi:** Really? That's too bad\.\.\.  
**Mimi:** Then, when'll we get to play, Hirona-onee-san\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.It's hard to sayyy\.  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.Though, I don't think that day is ever cominggg\.\)  
**Mimi:** Hirona-onee-san, let's make sure to play tomorrow\!  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.She's even doing this in the dormmms?\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Kagami-san, do you not have friends?  
**Mimi:** Huh? I do?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Then I think it would be better if you left me alone and played with them\.  
**Mimi:** You're my friend too, Hirona-onee-san, so it's all alright\!  
**Mimi:** And anyway, you can just call me Mimi, Hirona-onee-san\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.No thank youuu\.  
**Mimi:** Why not\!?  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.Because if I'm looking after you, my efficiency will go down\.\)  
**Hirona:** (I don't want to get any less efficient\.\.\. I'll alter my routine tomorrow so I won't run into Kagami-san\.\)  
**Hirona:** Yawn\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** I might have woken up too early after allll\.  
**Mimi:** But it feels great waking up early, doesn't it\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Do you normally eat breakfast at this time, Kagami-san?  
**Mimi:** Nope\.  
**Mimi:** I just had a feeling you'd be here right now, Hirona-onee-san\!  
**Hirona:** Ugh\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** (Is it on instinnnct\.\.\.? I have a sort of bad feeling about this\.\.\.\)  
**Mimi:** Fooound you, Hirona-onee-san\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Kagami-san, your voice is too loud\.  
**Hirona:** (I thought that I wouldn't see her if I adjusted my time in the library\.\.\.\)  
**Hirona:** Why did you think I would be here?  
**Mimi:** When you weren't in the classroom, I just looked everywhere around school\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Didn't you think I could have gone home early?  
**Mimi:** Nope\! Cause, you're Hirona-onee-san after all\!  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.That's not a reasonnn\.\)  
**Hirona:** (Still\.\.\. Kagami-san's impulsiveness is completely outside my ability to plan around\.\)  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.Instead of being indirect, it might be faster to to say it straight here\.\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Kagami-san\. Please don't come up to me anymore\. You're bothering me\.  
**Mimi:** Yeah, I hear that a lot\! Like, Mimi, you're a little troublemaker\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Didn't I say you were bothering me?  
**Mimi:** But, I still like you, Hirona-onee-san, so I'm gonna come see you\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** (Calling it "innocence" sounds better, but\.\.\. this girl just doesn't listen to people\.\.\.\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Sigh\. Fine then, do what you want\.  
**Mimi:** You mean it\!?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Trying to get rid of you was less efficient\.  
**Mimi:** Hooray\! Then, starting today, call me Mimi\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.No thank youuu\.  

## 2: The Four of Us Shopping
On a day off\.\.\.

  
**Kiyoka:** Our goal today is\.\.\. to pick out clothes for Nitta-san\!  
**Mihono/Yui:** Yeah-\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Yeah-\.  
**Mihono:** What kind of clothes do you think would look good on Hirona?  
**Kiyoka:** I get the feeling anything would work on her\. She could wear something cool or something cute just fine\.  
**Yui:** The more lightly dressed the better\!  
**Kiyoka:** That's rejected\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Awww\.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha\!  
**Mihono:** Hmm, which would look good on Hirona\.\.\. Ah, I bet Kohime'd like this one\!  
**Mihono:** I'm going to go buy it real quick\!  
**Yui:** You're totally in love with Kohime-chan, aren't you, Mihono-chan\! It's so precious it hurts though\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.It sure is\.  
**Mihono:** I'm back-\. Okay, so what should we do?  
**Kiyoka:** I want to have a short strategy meeting first, so how about we find something to eat?  
**Yui:** Like crepes?  
**Kiyoka:** Crepes\.\.\.  
**Yui:** What's wrong, Kiyoka-chan?  
**Kiyoka:** I've been a little worried about my waistline recently\.\.\. You know, it'll be summer soon, and then\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ahh, cause of swimsuits\.  
**Yui:** But I'd still like you if your belly's a little soft, Kiyoka-chan\.  
**Kiyoka:** I don't care if you'd like it\.\.\.  
**Yui:** That's so mean\!? But I like that too\!\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ah, sorry, Hirona\! We sort of got off-topic, didn't we\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.No, it's fun just listening to you three talk\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Is it though?  
**Hirona:** It is\.  
**Mihono:** (Still, we came to hang out with the four of us, so I want Hirona to be having a good time too\.\)  
**Mihono:** (Okay, I'll come up with something for Hirona to talk about\!\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Ah, Musumi-san\. I really like that outfit thereee\.  
**Kiyoka:** Oh, it's so cute\. I think I like it a lot too\.  
**Yui:** You two should try it on\! I'll be waiting for you\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.But you're planning on peeping, aren't youuu?  
**Yui:** She found me out\!?  
**Mihono:** Wait, huh\!? Hirona naturally worked her way into the conversation\!?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.What do you take me for? I know the flow of your conversations, so I can join in\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Actually, Asakura-san, were you thinking of looking out for meee?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.You noticed?  
**Hirona:** It seemed like something you'd dooo\. But changing the flow of the conversation would leave odd pauses, so isn't that less efficient?  
**Hirona:** That's why I tried joining in now and thennn\.  
**Mihono:** Then you could've just joined in from the start\!?  
**Hirona:** Sorrrry about that\. Even when I wasn't talking, the conversation was still moving smoothly, sooo\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Does anybody ever tell you you're strange, Hirona?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.How did you knowww? For some reason, I get told that sometimes\.  
**Mihono:** No, I think the reason's pretty clear\!  

## 3: My Hero
**Yuuki:** Hirona-san, are you busy later?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.I'm availableee\.  
**Yuuki:** Then, let's make an appointment to go shopping in half an hour\!  
**Hirona:** Okaaay\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.  
That evening\.\.\.

  
**Akira:** Yo, Hirona\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Oh, Akira-san\. Did you need somethiiing?  
**Akira:** You go along with whatever Yuuki asks you, don't you\.  
**Hirona:** I do?  
**Akira:** Yeah\.  
**Akira:** But you're all about efficiency\. And you actually had some plans today, didn't you?  
**Hirona:** I did, but Yuuki-san took higher priority\.  
**Akira:** Hmm\.  
**Akira:** I never asked, but, did something happen between you and Yuuki?  
**Hirona:** Something with\.\.\. Yuuki-saaan?  
**Hitakami Toji 1:** Huh\!? Nitta-san's in the same unit as us for this mission\!?  
**Hitakami Toji 2:** Didn't the last unit Nitta-san was part of break up after she stabbed them in the back?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.It's not like I turned on them because I wanted to stab them in the back\.\)  
**Hirona:** (It was just more efficient that way\.\.\. Though I doubt they would listen if I explained that\.\)  
**Hitakami Toji 1:** Hey, Nitta-san\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Yes?  
**Hitakami Toji 2:** Do you think we could work separate from each other? So long as we suppress the aradama, it doesn't matter\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Alriiight\. That would be more efficient, wouldn't ittt\.  
**Hitakami Toji 1:** Thanks\.  
**Hirona:** (You don't have to sound so relieved\.\.\. I wouldn't turn on anyone in a normal suppression assignment\.\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Well, I can do this more efficiently on my own thoughhh\.  
**Hirona:** [pant pant\]\.\.\.  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Hirona:** --\! HAAHH\!\!  
**Aradama:** GYOHHHHHHHHHH\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.More of them, againnn\.  
**Hirona:** (This is as hard as you'd expect\.\.\. I wonder how those two are doing\.\.\.\)  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOO\!  
**Hirona:** Kgh\!?  
**Hirona:** [pant pant\]\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** This isn't the time to worry about others, is ittt\.\.  
**Hirona:** (I really won't be able to keep fighting any longer\.\.\. I'd like to find some way of escaping, but\.\.\.\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.The problem is, which do I go withhh\.  
**Hirona:** (If I stay here, things will only get worse\.\.\.\)  
**Hirona:** All or nothing\.\.\. Is that what it comes down tooo\. Sigh, how inefficient\.\.\.  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.This was a bust, wasn't it\.  
**Aradama:** GAOOOOOOOOOOO\!  
**Hirona:** Grgh\.\.\.\!?  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Hirona:** (Is this it\.\.\.\!?\)  
**Yuuki:** HAAAAAAAAAAH\!\!  
**Yuuki:** Are you okay\!?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Yuuki-san? Why are you here\.\.\.?  
**Yuuki:** When you were the only one who didn't come back, I asked the other two what happened, and they said you were acting on your own\.  
**Yuuki:** So I came looking for you\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Thank you very much\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.And that's how it happened\.  
**Akira:** Huh, way to go, Yuuki\.  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.Well, that story should be enough to satisfy Akira-san-\.\)  
**Hirona:** (Though, the truth is I owe her something much harder to repay\.\.\. But that's not something I'd tell anyone\.\)  

## 4: Determination
**Aradama:** GYAOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Toji A:** The aradama are attacking\!\!  
**Toji B:** Why're there so many aradama\!? Wasn't this just a noro retrieval mission\!?  
**Toji A:** Worry about that later\! We're pushing them back\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Toji C:** Nitta-san\! Quit spacing out and draw your okatana\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Understoood\.  
**Toji:** \.\.\.Get ready, Nitta-san\. Aradama\.\.\. they won't go easy on you cause you're new\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Got it\.  
**Toji A:** Here they come\!  
**Hirona:** Gh\.\.\. Urkh\.\.\.  
**Rescue Party:** There's another toji collapsed over here\!  
**Rescue Party:** Hey, are you okay\!?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.My body hurts\.  
**Rescue Party:** We'll get you to a hospital right away\! Just hang in a little longer\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.What about my senpais?  
**Rescue Party:** \.\.\.You had the least severe injuries\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.That's not efficient at all\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Being hospitalized suuure is boring\.  
**Miyako:** In that case, mind if I borrow some of your time?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.You're my senpai, aren't you? Who are youuu?  
**Miyako:** Sasano Miyako, from the research course\. Good to meet you, Nitta-san\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.It's nice to meet you\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Oh? Am I wrong, or is your left arm\.\.\.  
**Miyako:** It is\. It happened\.\.\. a long time ago\.  
**Miyako:** Your mission this time, it was difficult for you all, wasn't it\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.It was\.  
**Miyako:** The kind of thing you'd call inefficient, right?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Yes\. Actually, it's because nothing about that mission was efficient\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Ah\. Does that count as criticizing the head of the Origami family?  
**Miyako:** Maybe\. I think it'd be best not to say much about that\.  
**Miyako:** Though\.\.\. It was interesting talking to you\. Anyway, I'll see you around\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Goodbye\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.What was that about, anyway?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.After being away from school for so long, I get called right away by the president\. Sasano-san might have reported me\.  
**Hirona:** Excuse me\.  
**Sana:** You're here\.  
**Miyako:** It's been a while\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Sasano-san, did you report meeee?  
**Miyako:** If I had to say one way or the other, I guess I did?  
**Miyako:** Though, it's not in a bad way\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Ah, then you aren't mad at me\. In that case, it's alllright\.  
**Sana:** She's a funny one\.  
**Miyako:** I thought you might like her\. \.\.\.What do you think?  
**Sana:** Sure, I don't see why not\.  
**Sana:** I'm going to get straight to the point\.\.\. Nitta, do you want to join Mokusa?  
**Hirona:** Mokusa?  
**Sana:** Mokusa opposes Origami Yukari\.\.\. It's an organization formed to oppose the revisionists led by Origami Yukari, with the intent of restoring okatana and toji to the state they should be\.  
**Sana:** Nobody's going to force you, but\.\.\. You want to change the way things are now too, don't you, Nitta?  
**Sana:** What do you say?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Alright thennn\.  
**Hirona:** Toji being injured is inefficient, sooo\. If it improves our situation, I'll joiiin\.  
**Sana:** \.\.\.I had a feeling you'd say that\.  
**Sana:** Nitta, there's somebody out there with similar opinions to yours\. Do you want to go meet them now?  
**Hirona:** With similar opinions to mine\.\.\. I want to meet them\. Could you tell me their name for nowww?  
**Sana:** Sure\. Her name is\.\.\. Hitakami Makoto\.  

## 5: An Inefficient Method
**Makoto:** Have you finished preparing for your trip to Okinawa?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Yeeep, I'm ready to go-\. I have my summer clothes and swimsuit with meee\.  
**Akira:** Your swimsuit? You know you're not going there for fun, right?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I know thaaat\.  
**Hirona:** But, I won't know what I'll need, and couldn't the target I'm observing say she wants to go to the beach?  
**Yuuki:** This great aradama the Sword Administration Bureau is safeguarding\.\.\. Her name was Kohime? Would great aradamas really be interested in things like going to the beach?  
**Makoto:** If it were Tagitsuhime, surely she wouldn't\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I think she might because of Asakura-san's influence\. She became attached to Asakura-san\.  
**Akira:** Cause of Mihono then\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Damnit, now that Mihono's started showing those powers, I really don't want to be giving up somebody trustworthy\.  
**Makoto:** This observation mission in Okinawa is also something we could only leave to someone we can trust\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Please leave Okinawa to meee\.  
**Akira:** I get all that, okay\.  
**Akira:** Ahh, fuck it\! Things just can't go our way, can they\!  
**Makoto:** Akira-chan?  
**Akira:** I'm going for a ride to clear my head\!  
**Makoto:** I suppose that's the end of that\.  
**Yuuki:** What are you going to do now, Makoto-nee-sama?  
**Makoto:** I'm sure that Akira-chan will be back in time for dinner, so I'll get the food ready\.  
**Makoto:** Hirona-san, you should stay and eat with us today\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Thank you very muuuch\.  
**Hirona:** It's the two of us now\. What will you do, Yuuki-san?  
**Yuuki:** I'm going to do my secret training\. You should join me, Hirona-san\!  
**Yuuki:** HAAAAAAAAAAH\!\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.  
**Hirona:** (Once I'm in Okinawa\.\.\. I won't be able to join Yuuki-san for a while\.\)  
**Yuuki:** YAAAAAH\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Oh, I lost, didn't I\.  
**Yuuki:** Hirona-san\! Please stay focused\! I have to\.\.\. I have to train to be even stronger\!  
**Yuuki:** Please go another round with me\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Okaaay\.  
**Hirona:** (If Yuuki-san wants to be stronger\.\.\. Becoming a tamayori toji would be the efficient thing to do\.\)  
**Hirona:** (But\.\.\.\)  
**Yuuki:** YAAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Hirona:** Nh\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** That was a good strike just now\.  
**Yuuki:** You mean it\!?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I wouldn't want that, would I\.  
**Yuuki:** Hirona-san?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Just talking to myseeelf\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.More importantly, let's go another round, before you forget the feeling of that strike\.  
**Yuuki:** Okay\! If you'll have me\!  
**Hirona:** (It might be inefficient\.\.\. but I think training like this is what's right for Yuuki-san\.\)  

## [Hirona Joins: Start\]: Time For a Contest\!
**Yuuki:** The three of us haven't gone on a mission for a while, have we, Akira-nee-sama, Hirona-san\!  
**Akira:** Yeah, now that you mention it, that's right\.  
**Akira:** It's mostly the same for me, but Hirona's not around a lot\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Were you talking about meee?  
**Akira:** You seriously move at your own beat, y'know that?  
**Yuuki:** We were just saying, it's been a while since the three of us were on a mission together\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I think you're right\.  
**Hirona:** But, it's mostly Akira-san's fault that I'm busy, isn't it-?  
**Akira:** I'm just the one telling you your missions\!  
**Hirona:** Ehh, but there's missions from you too, aren't there?  
**Akira:** They're not from me, they're from Makocchan\!  
**Yuuki:** That's just proof that they trust you\! And I trust you too, of course\!  
**Akira:** That's how it is\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.It all depends on how you put it\.  
**Hirona:** Well, since Akira-san is here today, I'm going to take it easy\. That'll be most efficient\.  
**Akira:** Quit trying to make things easy just for yourself\!  
**Hirona:** I'd like to save my energy for when it really matteeers\.  
**Akira:** Hahh\!? Then I'm gonna work you whether you like it or not\!  
**Akira:** Yuuki, Hirona\! We're making this a competition to see who gets the most aradama\! Last place buys dinner\!  
**Yuuki:** We're competing\!? Bring it on\!		[Yuuki uses Akira's catchphrase\]  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.If Yuuki-san is fine with it, it's okay with me too\.  
**Akira:** No backing out then\!  
**Akira:** I'm not about to let you beat me, Yuuki\! Hirona\!  
**Yuuki:** I won't lose either\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.  
**Akira:** ORAAH\! Onnne\! Twooo\! Threee\!  
**Yuuki:** HAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Hirona:** You two are working very hard\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Then, I'll go at it efficiently too\.  

## [Hirona Joins: End\]: Fighting Efficiently
**Hirona:** \.\.\.The aradama readings sure are going away surprisingly quickly\.  
**Hirona:** Though\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** The biggest reading is this way\.  
**Hirona:** I don't think I'll be able to beat Akira-san in numbers, but I can hunt big game efficiently hereee\.  
**Large Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Hirona:** That's a big one-\.  
**Hirona:** Then\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** I'll just defeat you-\.  
**Large Aradama:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.  
**Large Aradama:** OOAA\!?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Are you surprised I avoided that? That slow attack won't hit me\.  
**Large Aradama:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Hirona:** HMPH-\!\!  
**Large Aradama:** GYAAAAAAAAAAAAA\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.That's all there is to it\. Now, I can go back\.  
**Akira:** Huhh\!? You just got a single one\!?  
**Hirona:** Yes\. Though, I beat the one that seemed strongest\.  
**Yuuki:** So Hirona-san was big game hunting\!  
**Hirona:** I worked hard efficientlyyy\.  
**Akira:** So you went for quality over quanity\.\.\.? Damnit, what do we do now\.  
**Yuuki:** Nee-sama had quanity, Hirona-san had quality\.\.\. Either way, I came in last\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Judge, please decide\. Which of us won?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Sigh\. You're saying that cause you know how I am, aren't ya?  
**Akira:** No matter how many weak aradama you beat, they're all just the same\!  
**Hirona:** Hooray-\. In that case, you'll buy dinner for Yuuki-san and meee\.  
**Akira:** Hah\!?  
**Yuuki:** Hirona-san\!? But I'm the one who came in last\!?  
**Hirona:** The one who came up with it didn't come in first, so it's the same as coming in last\.  
**Akira:** You've got some real nerve\.\.\. No other way around it\! You two eat whatever you want\! It's on me\!  
**Hirona:** Got iiit\. Fufu, let's have something tasty, Yuuki-san\.
