======================

## 1: Prologue: The Illusory Aradama
**Mihono:**ã€€A strange acting\.\.\. aradama?  
**Mirja:** Yes\. An aradama that causes people to see visions\.\.\. There's been reports of a fair number of toji coming in contact with it\.  
**Yui:** Visions? Like what happens in manga, where they're like, "Where are you aiming; that's an illusion\!"  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Or something\.  
**Kiyoka:** (I don't think they'd call that visions though\.\.\. It's probably more like\.\.\.\)  
**Mai:** They say it shows you the future\.  
**Sayaka:** The future?   
**Ellen:** Like seeing yourself even better at swordfighting than you are now, or seeing yourself caught in a tough situation\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** That's apparently why they keep saying, "I saw my future\!"  
**Kanami:** Huh, so there's aradama like that out there\. That actually sounds kinda fun\.  
**Yume:** I wanna try seeing those visions once\.  
**Maki:** This isn't all fun and games\.  
**Maki:** Things are alright for now, since none of the toji have been directly hurt yet, but\.\.\. we have no idea what that aradama is trying to do\.  
**Maki:** We need to suppress it as fast as possible\.  
**Suzuka:** That's right\. Which is why so many toji have been gathered to find it, us included\.  
**Yomi:** Everyone, I've located the aradama\. The nearest unit is\.\.\.  
**Illusory Aradama:** \.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** So it showed up for us\! We're going to start suppressing it\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Wait, it's gone?  
**Hiyori:** There's a good chance it's still around here\. Let's search for\.\.\. Nn? Where's Kanami?  
**Illusory Aradama:** \.\.\.  
**Suruga:** You brought yet another in? It's impressive how you never tire of this\.  
**Illusory Aradama:** \.\.\.  
**Suruga:** You do understand? What you show them are no more than illusions\.  
**Suruga:** However many illusions you show, it will bring you no closer to your objective\.  
**Illusory Aradama:** \.\.\.  
**Suruga:** Hmph\. You shouldn't waste the effort; simply kill them\. It would be better for you\.  
**Illusory Aradama:** \.\.\.  

## 2: Kanami's Disappearance
**Mihono:** Hey, Mai\. Did Kanami\.\.\. message you or anything?  
**Mai:** She didn't\.\.\. I haven't heard anything today either\.  
**Mihono:** She's already been gone for a week, hasn't she\!? Aghh, what if she got in an accident or something\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** If she had, we'd have heard about it from the bureau\.  
**Mihono:** But then\.\.\. did Kanami really run off somewhere by herself?  
**Mai:** I think\.\.\. that's pretty likely\.  
**Mai:** Actually, it seems like there was some kind of proposal from people in the government to monitor and put restrictions on Kanami-chan\.  
**Mihono:** No way\!? Why though\!?  
**Hiyori:** Because of her strength\.\.\. isn't that it?  
**Mai:** They gave up on it after Akane-sama and the others pushed back, but there's still plenty who think she could be dangerous\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** But, that's all messed up\. Sure, lately Kanami's been really strong, and she totally outplays me a lot, but\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Still, Kanami's been protecting everybody this whole time, so I know she's not dangerous or anything for anybody\.  
**Mai:** That's true\. I feel the same way\. But, if someone has powers\.\.\. the kind of strength they don't understand, there's people who would feel afraid of that\.  
**Mai:** And that's why, Kanami-chan might have\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** She does tend to pick up on things pretty well\. So, what happened is\.\.\. she didn't want to cause trouble for the rest of us, so she ran away?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Kanami\.  
**Hiyori:** Are you kidding me\.\.\.\! You're just going to disappear like that\!?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** (Today\.\.\. what Mai said is probably right\. I heard something similar from President Gojou and Origami Yukari\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (But\.\.\. I get the feeling there's more to it, something else that made Kanami leave\.\)  
**Hiyori:** I'm going to find you and bring you back, Kanami\.  
**Hiyori:** (I won't leave you all on your own\.\.\. So, there's something I have to do here\.\)  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.HAAHH\!  
**Kaoru:** You sure are pushing yourself\.  
**Kaoru:** Couldn't you at least take a break when you come out here on an expedition?  
**Kaoru:** Knowing you, you've probably been at this every single day the last half a year she's been gone\.  
**Hiyori:** I make sure to take breaks\. It's not going to be an issue\.  
**Kaoru:** I guess I'll take your word for it\. Though, it's pretty important, finding time to relax-\. Here, take this\.  
**Hiyori:** This brand of chocomint ice cream; they just started making it\. That's actually thoughtful of you\.  
**Kaoru:** Right? By the way, did you hear from Mihono and Mai? Seems like they ran into Kanami\.  
**Hiyori:** They told me\. She came to help when they were struggling with an aradama going wild\.  
**Kaoru:** But then she tried to bail right away, and even though they chased after, there was no way they could keep up\.  
**Kaoru:** Just when it's been forever since they saw her, she goes and ditches them again; she's a real pain in the ass, isn't she?  
**Hiyori:** Must have been\.\.\. her jin'i\. And she's got to be able to go very deep with it by now\.  
**Kaoru:** Well, that's how she is, Hiyori\. You've gotta take care of her for us\.  
**Kaoru:** Anyway, I'm going to bed\. Don't go staying up too late, alright-\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Sure\.  
**Hiyori:** (I have this feeling\.\.\. If I can cross okatana with her, I'll understand what's going through Kanami's head\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (I'm sure I'll get this across too\. How badly I-- How much everyone wants you back with them\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (And when I beat you, I'm dragging you right back here\.\)  

## 3: Even if You Reach Even Greater Heights
**Hiyori:** I see\. So you're saying, on the mountain up ahead, whenever people encounter aradama, they disappear right after\.  
**Local Resident:** Well, it's been happening for about a year now I think\. We thought maybe it was a toji helping us, but we never saw sight of one\.  
**Local Resident:** It's happened so many times now that folks are saying there might really be a god of the mountain up there\.  
**Hiyori:** Thanks a lot for telling me all this\. I'll try looking into it\.  
**Hiyori:** (Exorcising aradama in an instant and never letting anyone see her; who else would be pulling that off?\)  
**Hiyori:** Just a little longer, Kanami\.  
**Hiyori:** Found you\. \.\.\.Seeing you still just swordfighting even out here; in a way, it's actually a relief\.  
**Hiyori:** (Kanami\.\.\. It's been a while since I saw her, but she definitely feels different from before\. Like there's an air of purity to her\.\)  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** (Though even with that, she's still Kanami\.\)  
**Hiyori:** You're going to be coming back with me\.  
**Kanami:** So that's why\. Alright then\.  
**Hiyori:** Let's go\!  
**Kanami:** Hahh\~\.\.\. You really are strong, Hiyori-chan\.\.\. It's sorta hard dealing that "hitotsu no tachi" of yours\.  
**Hiyori:** Does that mean you're admitting I beat you?  
**Kanami:** Hmm\. Sure, you beat me this time\. You're even faster than I was imagining you'd be\!  
**Hiyori:** Well, I spent as much time as I could to show you just how strong I can be\.  
**Hiyori:** (Though, I don't know how serious Kanami was about our fight just now\.\.\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (The way she's gotten, if she used kongoushin or went all out with jin'i, could she have defended against me?\)  
**Kanami:** Hehe, that makes me kinda happy\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** "Kinda happy"-- That's all you have to say? Honestly\.\.\. Don't go running off to be all alone again, you idiot\.  
**Kanami:** Mm, thanks\.  
**Hiyori:** If I said all the things I wanted to, we'd be here all day\. We're going home\. Everyone's waiting\.  
**Kanami:** I think this is the first time took me by the hand like this, isn't it?  
**Hiyori:** There's no way that's true\. Probably\.  
**Kanami:** That day when we first fought each other, back at the tournament\. I was the one who grabbed your hand and we ran away together\. Now it's totally the other way around\.  
**Hiyori:** And just like back then, I'm still always the one getting swept up in whatever you do\.  
**Kanami:** Hey, Hiyori-chan\. I don't think\.\.\. I'll ever be able to give up on training with the sword\.  
**Hiyori:** What's wrong with that? I couldn't imagine you giving up swordfighting anyway\.  
**Hiyori:** And besides, it's not like I'm planning on giving up training anytime soon either\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Yeah\! Let's spar again then\!  

## [Another - Hiyori: Start\]: I Want It to Be Me
Several days after Etou Kanami disappeared\.

  
**Hiyori:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAH\!\!  
**Ellen:** Uwah\!?  
**Kaoru:** Gh\.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** Is that the best both of you have got\!?  
**Kaoru:** Is that how you want to play this\.\.\. Don't blame us if you get hurt then\!  
**Ellen:** You'd better be ready, Hiyoyon\!  
**Sanae:** She's really intense about this\.\.\.  
**Sanae:** (Seeing her like that\.\.\. It's like Juujou-san's back to when I first met her\.\)  
**Sayaka:** I think Hiyori feels like that's not enough\.  
**Sanae:** Even though they're fighting so fiercely?  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan can copy the schools of swordfighting of people she's faced against\.  
**Sanae:** She copies them\.\.\. so it's like fighting against multiple toji at once\.\.\.?  
**Mai:** That's right\.  
**Sanae:** So, in order to beat Etou-san, she'd need more than just the thunder god's power, she'd have to have the skill to fight multiple schools at the same time?  
**Sanae:** And that's why Juujou-san's fighting them all at once\.\.\.  
**Mai:** I'm not sure if doing it this way will actually get her her powers back\. Still\.\.\. this training won't be for nothing though\.\.\.  
**Sanae:** Juujou-san really is incredible, isn't she\. Wait, what are you making that face for?  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Even still, this training is just too much\. It's only a matter of time before she hurts herself\.  
**Sanae:** \.\.\.I know\.  
**Hiyori:** Next, come on\!\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.Oi, don't you think you should be taking a break?  
**Ellen:** She's right, Hiyoyon\. You're going to get yourself hurt before you manage to get your powers back\.  
**Hiyori:** [pant pant\]\.\.\. I'll be fine\.  
**Sayaka:** What should we do, Mai?  
**Mai:** Let's take a little break, okay, Hiyori-chan?  
**Sanae:** (\.\.\.Juujou-san when I first met her, she would never take breaks\.\.\.\)  
**Sanae:** In that case, let me fight you\.  
**Hiyori:** Thanks, Iwakura-san\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Are you sure about this, Iwakura-san? If she keeps wearing away at herself like this, her body's going to give out first\.\.\.  
**Sanae:** \.\.\.Etou-san is someone special to Juujou-san\. So I'm sure, no matter what anyone says, she won't stop\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.  
**Sanae:** Here I come\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Bring it on then\!\!  
**Hiyori:** Mihono, there's something I want to ask you\. Could you face off sparring with me?  
**Mihono:** Sure, I'll do it\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.You're not going to ask why?  
**Mihono:** I can tell even if I don't ask\. It has to do with Kanami running away, right?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.It does\.  
**Hiyori:** I want to get back the power of the thunder god\. That's why, I thought it'd be best if I came to you, since you became an evil god once, like I did\.  
**Mihono:** Okay; I don't know how much I'll be able to help out, but I'll try\!  
**Hiyori:** Kgh, one more time\!  
**Mihono:** Nah, we should pause here\! Let's take a break\.  
**Hiyori:** Mihono, we don't have time for\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** You can't rush yourself, Juujou-san\. You have to make sure to rest too\.  
**Hiyori:** Still\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** It'll be fine\. I mean, there's a whole bunch of people looking for Kanami\.  
**Mihono:** So for what we can do, we've gotta make sure we do it right\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** I never thought I'd see the day Mihono turns logic on me\. But\.\.\. yeah, maybe you're right\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, see\!  
**Mihono:** If we all try convincing her, I know Kanami'll come back\!  
**Hiyori:** No, that's not going to work\.  
**Mihono:** Eh?  
**Hiyori:** Kanami's getting too strong\. That's why she left us\.  
**Hiyori:** Sure, if we talked to her, maybe she would come back\. But\.\.\. it wouldn't change anything\.  
**Hiyori:** Kanami needs a toji on her own level, someone as strong as her, to tell her she's not alone\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Maybe, yeah\.  
**Mihono:** So you want to be that person, Juujou-san?  
**Hiyori:** Yeah; I don't think it can be anyone but me\.  
**Hiyori:** Besides, if I couldn't do anything to Kanami, how frustrating would that be?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.I know what you mean\.  
**Mihono:** Breaktime's over\! Let's get back to it\!  
**Hiyori:** Sure\!  

## [Another - Hiyori: End\]: Surpass This Feeling
**Hiyori:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH\!\!  
**Mihono:** --\!\!  
**Mihono:** (Juujou-san's really passionate about this\.\)  
**Mihono:** (But\.\.\. it's not like I don't want Kanami back either\. I want to be able to help both Kanami and Juujou-san\!\)  
**Mihono:** Ah\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Mihono, that glow\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Looks like Kanayamahime's giving me her strength\.  
**Mihono:** Get your okatana ready, Juujou-san\.\.\. Here I come\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** Gh--\!  
**Hiyori:** (She's strong\.\.\. It takes everything I've got just keeping up with her\.\.\. This is what Mihono's like when she's using Kanayamahime's power\.\.\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (\.\.\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (With Mihono like this, I'm sure Kanami would\.\.\.\)  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.I guess that's enough\.  
**Mihono:** Huh?  
**Hiyori:** If you're this strong, you can get through to Kanami\. You could convince her, Mihono\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** We can't do that\!\!  
**Hiyori:** But\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I don't think I'll be able to use Kanayamahime's power any more than right here, right now\.  
**Mihono:** Kanayamahime's backing me up because of how much I want to help you, Juujou-san\.  
**Mihono:** That's why\.\.\. You have to do better than me\!\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.It shook my confidence, getting overtaken by you\.  
**Hiyori:** But, you're not the one that gets to stand with Kanami\.\.\. THAT'S MY PLACE\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! That's how it's gotta be, Juujou-san\!  
**Hiyori:** Come on\!\!  
**Mihono:** Here goes, Juujou-san\!  
**Hiyori:** Just now, that was\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Mihono: Here goes, Juujou-san\!  
**Hiyori:** I can see it, Mihono\!\!  
**Mihono:** --\!?  
**Hiyori:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH\!\!  
**Mihono:** You got your powers back, huh\.  
**Hiyori:** Because of you, Mihono\. Thanks\.  
**Mihono:** I'm glad I could do something to help you\! \.\.\.You have to bring Kanami back, okay\.  
**Hiyori:** Yeah, just leave her to me\.  
**Hiyori:** Alright, I'm going now\.  
**Sanae:** Are you really going to go by yourself?  
**Hiyori:** Yeah\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** Hiyori\! I want to go with you after all\.  
**Hiyori:** Sorry, but no\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Just bear with it\. Hiyori's the only one who can take on Kanami\. If we were there, we'd be in their way\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.I don't like this\.  
**Kaoru:** It's not like I do\.  
**Mai:** We might not be able to go with her, but we can give her our support\.  
**Ellen:** Feel free to call us for anything\! We all feel the same as you do, Hiyoyon\!  
**Hiyori:** Sure, I'll keep it in mind\.  
**Sanae:** If we hear anything, we'll let you know right away\. \.\.\.Have a safe trip\.  
**Hiyori:** I'll be going then\!  
A few weeks later\.

  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** That's it?  
**Woman:** Thank you, you've saved us\!  
**Hiyori:** No, this much was nothing\.  
**Woman:** You're awfully strong, aren't you\. Almost like that tengu they keep talking about\!  
**Hiyori:** Tengu?  
**Woman:** Right\! There's this rumor lately, whenever an aradama appears, the tengu comes from nowhere to take care of them\!  
**Woman:** Let me find it\.\.\. Ah, here it is\! Here's a picture someone uploaded\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Looks like I'll finally get to see you\.  
**Woman:** Eh?  
**Hiyori:** Nothing; thanks\. I've finally found what I'm looking for\.  
**Hiyori:** Just up ahead\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Wait for me, Kanami\.  
**Hiyori:** I'll be there with you soon\. And then\.\.\. I'm going to beat you\.
