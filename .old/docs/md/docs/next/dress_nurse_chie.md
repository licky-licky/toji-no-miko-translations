## [Dress - Chie: Start\]: Taking a Breather
**Chie:** Nnn\.\.\.\! They're finally done drawing raffle tickets-\. I can take a break at last\.  
**Chie:** I wonder if there's any food left?  
**Ellen:** Thanks for helping out, Chie\!  
**Hashi Keiko:** Yes, thank you, Setouchi-san\.  
**Chie:** You two worked hard yourselves\.  
**Chie:** I'm happy the raffle competition went off without a hitch\. Though, Kaoru-san\.\.\. It's too bad about her\.  
**Ellen:** That's just business as usual for Kaoru, so it's fine\! More importantly, you must be feeling hungry, right?  
**Ellen:** We went and got food just for you, Chie\!  
**Keiko:** H-Here you go\!  
**Chie:** Thank you\. I was actually starving\.  
**Chie:** An assortment of cakes from Ellen-san, and pizza from Hashi-san\.  
**Keiko:** W-We didn't know what you liked, so we picked safe choices\.\.\.  
**Keiko:**ã€€Ah, I made sure the pizza was good too\. Like this Genovese here, or this cheese\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Hmm, are they? Let me have a taste\.\.\. Mm, this sauce is perfect\.  
**Keiko:** I'm glad you're happy with it\.  
**Keiko:** \.\.\.Thanks for everything you did, Setouchi-san\. I was very nervous, and\.\.\. it's because of you I managed to do my job in the executive committee\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Mm-mm, I didn't do anything special\.  
**Chie:** And besides, if you hadn't been there, Hashi-san, I think we would have been in more trouble, like with setting up the stage\.  
**Chie:** It was a real help having you along with us, alright?  
**Keiko:** Setouchi-san\.\.\.\!  
**Ellen:** Chie\! The cakes I got are excellent too\! These had to have been made by a first-class patissier\!  
**Ellen:** Hurry up and have some\!  
**Chie:** H-Hang on, Ellen-san\.\.\. I-I can't eat that quickly\!  
**Keiko:** U-Um, Setouchi-san, what foods do you like? I'll go get some\.  
**Chie:** Thank you\. But, that sentiment alone is enough\.  
**Chie:** I'm sure they wouldn't have any hoba miso\.\.\. And I don't think grilled fish would go very well with pizza, would it?  
**Keiko:** You're probably right\.  
**Chie:** I'll have the cake now, Ellen-san\. \.\.\.Oh, this is tasty\.  
**Chie:** The cream's so fluffy\.\.\. I feel like I could just keep on eating these\.  
**Ellen:** Yes\! It's like it melts in your mouth\!

## [Dress - Chie: End\]: Because I'm Her Onee-san
**Chie:** Phew\.\.\. I think I overate a tad\.  
**Mihono:** Heyyy\! Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan, and\.\.\. Etou-san? Is something wrong?  
**Kanami:** Ah, nothing like that, Mihono-chan and I were just going around trying the food on all the tables\!  
**Mihono:** Did you already eat, Chii-nee?  
**Chie:** Yes, I did\. Ellen-san and Hashi-san went and got me some pizza and cake to eat\.  
**Kanami:** Pizza and cake\! They both sound good\!  
**Chie:** They were\. I ate too much before I could help it\.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha, you're a real greedy eater like that, Chii-nee\.  
**Chie:** I don't want to hear that from you when you're the one still eating, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** Ah, I guess you've got me there\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Setouchi-san, you feel a little different when you're talking with Mihono-chan\.  
**Kanami:** Normally it's like, you're really adult\!  
**Chie:** We have been friends since we were little, after all\. Though\.\.\. Do I really seem that adult?  
**Kanami:** When you're wearing a dress that sexy, you look way more adult than me\.  
**Chie:** I-Is it too much?  
**Mihono:** No way, Chii-nee\! You look really good in it\!  
**Mihono:** Hey, Kanami\. You think we'll have that kind of sexiness in a few years?  
**Kanami:** That might be\.\.\. a little tough for us\.  
**Chie:** Come on, you two\. Those dresses look nice on you as well, you know?  
**Chie:** You look like proper young ladies\.  
**Mihono:** You mean it? Kanami, we're ladies now\!  
**Kanami:** Ladies\.\.\. It's kinda embarrassing, getting called that\.  
**Chie:** And besides, you two will be ready to wear a dress like mine before you know it\.  
**Mihono:** Ehh, are you sure about that\.\.\.?  
**Kanami:** Though, when Setouchi-san says it, it sounds like it really could happen\.  
**Mihono:** You're not wrong\.\.\. That's Chii-nee for you\!  
**Chie:** And what do you mean by that, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** I dunno? Ah, I guess cause you're Chii-nee and all, that's what I'd expect\!  
**Chie:** Because I'm me\.\.\. Is that why? Well thanks, Mihono-chan\.  
**Kanami:** That's enough for you?  
**Chie:** Of course\. After all, I am her onee-san\.

## [Nurse - Chie: Start\]: I'm Worried After All
**Mihono:** You're going to be in a practical exercise for medical courses?  
**Chie:** That's right\. It's part of a lecture I took that sounded interesting\. Which is why I won't be there for the investigation team on the day of the exercise\.  
**Mirja:** I understand\.  
**Mirja:** Everyone's shown considerable growth lately\. Even not having you with us, there shouldn't be any problems\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.I'm glad to hear it\.  
**Chie:** (That gives me some relief, but\.\.\. it makes me a little lonely too\.\)  
**Kiyoka:** What is it you'll be doing for a practical exercise in a medical course?  
**Chie:** It looks like we'll be acting as nurses\.  
**Yui:** Are you serious\!?  
**Yui:** Ah, I wanna see\. I wanna see it so bad\. Chie-san as a nurse; she'd be a real angel in white\!  
**Kofuki:** Huh? Like Chichie could ever cut it as an angel\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** She's more like a demon\! A demon in white\!  
**Kofuki:** You've never seen Chichie get pissed for real before\. You can totally see horns and everything\.  
**Chie:** Fufu, Kofuki-chan? Don't you think that might be the fault of the one making me upset?  
**Kofuki:** See, look at her\! She's freaky as hell, right\!  
**Chie:** Kofuki-chan? Get on your knees\.  
**Yui:** Look, that's what you get for making Chie-san angry\.  
**Kiyoka:** Yui-chan's completely right, Kofuki-san\.  
**Yui:** Forgetting about Kofuki-san, we all think you'd look great in it\. Chie-san in her nurse cosplay\!  
**Chie:** \.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Cosplay?  
**Yui:** Yeah, Mihono-chan\!  
**Yui:** Must be so nice, Chie-san in nurse cosplay\! I want her to nurse me gently inside and out\!  
**Chie:** Yui-chan?  
**Yui:** Yes, Chie-san\!  
**Chie:** On your knees\.  
**Yui:** Why me too\!?  
**Chie:** Honestly now\.  
**Chie:** Mirja, I'm sure it won't be easy on you, but do your best looking after them\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.I know, I will\.  

## [Nurse - Chie: End\]: It's Alright
**Sakura:** \.\.\.I'm Hamatsuka Sakura, from the medical department\. I'm glad to be working with you today\.  
**Chie:** And I am too, Hamatsuka-san\. I'm Setouchi Chie\.  
**Chie:** It's nice to meet you\.\.\. Though, this isn't the first time we've met, is it?  
**Sakura:** Yes\. I've seen you sometimes, at Ban-san's lab\.  
**Sakura:** Though, this is the first time we've had an actual conversation\.  
**Chie:** That's right\.  
**Chie:** As soon as you're done treating us, you always leave right away, Hamatsuka-san\.  
**Sakura:** \.\.\.I'm sorry\.  
**Chie:** Fufu, it's not anything you need to apologize for\.  
**Chie:** Though, I've always thought that I wanted to talk with you, so I'm glad\.  
**Chie:** No matter how small the injury, you always treat it with care, don't you, Hamatsuka-san? So I was curious what sort of girl you were\.  
**Sakura:** But, I'm not that\.\.\.  
**Nurse:** We're going to be starting the practical exercise soon\. Please gather around-\.  
**Sakura:** Ah, the exercise is starting\. We should go\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.She ran away\. Did I do something to make her not like me?  
**Patient A:** Thank you very much\.  
**Chie:** Not at all; please take care of yourself\.  
**Patient B:** Excuse me, I'd like to ask something\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Yes, what do you need?  
**Sakura:** (\.\.\.She's amazing\. So many people are just going over to Setouchi-san\.\.\.\)  
**Sakura:** \.\.\.  
**Chie:** Good work, Hamatsuka-san\. That was nerve-wracking, with how unfamiliar I was with everything\.  
**Sakura:** You didn't seem that way at all\. Um\.\.\.  
**Chie:** What is it?  
**Sakura:** There's something I'm having trouble with\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Mmhm?  
**Sakura:** \.\.\.No, I shouldn't be asking you after all\. I can't go into much detail about it\.\.\.  
**Chie:** (Was what's bothering her the reason she avoided me before?\)  
**Chie:** \.\.\.You said you're having trouble with something, but, do you know exactly what it is?  
**Sakura:** \.\.\.I do\.  
**Chie:** (If I had to guess\.\.\. She's avoiding getting involved with other people? But, she's trying to talk about it with me\.\.\.\)  
**Chie:** You'll be alright\.  
**Sakura:** Eh?  
**Chie:** You're a kind and earnest girl, Hamatsuka-san\. So long as you know what's causing it, I'm sure you'll get through it someday\.  
**Sakura:** \.\.\.  
**Sakura:** Thank you very much\. That makes me feel a little better\.  
**Chie:** No, I'm the one who should be thanking you\.  
**Chie:** After all, without people like you there for us, us toji wouldn't be able to keep on fighting\.  
**Chie:** So\.\.\. we'll keep being in your care in the future\.  
**Sakura:** Okay\!
