## [Heijou Jersey - Kiyoka: Start\]: Something That Needs to Be Done for the New Year
**Kiyoka:** I think that was the last of the aradama\. \.\.\.Even though the year's almost over, we still have to do the same amount of missions\.  
**Hiyori:** I wish they'd give it a rest this time of year, but they\.\.\. That kind of thing doesn't matter to aradama\.  
**Kiyoka:** If only there'd be a little less\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Have you not been able to go home and see your family in a while, Kiyoka?  
**Kiyoka:** Lately\.\.\. not so much\.  
**Kiyoka:** But, and it depends on what comes up, but I think I'll be able to go back home for 2 or 3 days during New Year's\.  
**Hiyori:** I'm sure your parents would be glad to see you\.  
**Kiyoka:** What about you, Juujou-san?  
**Hiyori:** I got invited to spend New Year's Eve with Kanami, Kaoru, and the rest\.  
**Hiyori:** We talked about going right after that to make our first shrine visit too\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, we did too\. I promised Hono-chan we'd all go together\.  
**Kiyoka:** We still aren't sure where we're going, but maybe to Hono-chan's home\.  
**Hiyori:** Oh yeah, Mihono lives at a shrine, doesn't she\.  
**Kiyoka:** I asked Hono-chan and she said she'd let me try on miko clothing, so I'm a little excited\.  
**Hiyori:** Thinking about it, there's not a lot of days left, but I guess we both can't wait for New Year's\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.\!  
**Kiyoka:** You're right, but\.\.\. there's something I have to do before that\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** ? We didn't have much homework over winter break, did we?  
**Kiyoka:** It's cleaning season\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** I still have to do a big cleanup of my dorm room\.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** It's just cleaning your room; it won't be that big a deal\.  
**Kiyoka:** I've been so busy lately, I haven't had time to tidy up\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** I still do basic cleaning, of course, but\.\.\. I just can't seem to get around to it\.  
**Hiyori:** Alright then\. If tomorrow works, do you want me to help you out?  
**Kiyoka:** Will you really\!?  
**Hiyori:** Sure\.  
**Kiyoka:** Thanks a lot\! That would help so much\! I have the day off tomorrow too\.  
**Hiyori:** Is it that bad that you have to grab my hands\.\.\.?  
**Hiyori:** (Could Kiyoka actually be bad at cleaning\.\.\.?\)  
**Kiyoka:** With that settled, when we get back to town, why don't we go eat something sweet to cheer ourselves up?  
**Hiyori:** I'm fine with that\.  
**Kiyoka:** Great\~\!  
**Hiyori:** You're just looking for a reason to go eat sweets, aren't you?  
**Kiyoka:** Actually, the other day, I found a shop that a lot of people are saying serves delicious fruit gratin\. I really wanted to try it, but it's hard to go there by myself\.  
**Hiyori:** So that's why\. Then, no point in wasting time here\.  

## [Heijou Jersey - Kiyoka: End\]: The Temptations That Sneak into Cleaning\!
**Kiyoka:** Phew\.\.\. I think that's enough vacuuming to start\.  
**Kiyoka:** I'm glad I finished before Juujou-san got here\.  
**Kiyoka:** Even though she's coming to help, I have to do this much first\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Umm\.\.\. Okay, I have all the cleaning supplies\. And enough strings to tie up magazines\.  
**Kiyoka:** I know\! Before we get started, I'll change into my jersey\.  
**Hiyori's Voice:** Kiyoka\. I'm here to help out\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, I'll get the door-\!  
**Hiyori:** Just from looking around, it doesn't seem bad enough you needed somebody else's help\.  
**Kiyoka:** For the end of the year cleaning, I just need to do things like the windows\.\.\. The big problem is sorting through all the books and magazines I subscribed to this year\.  
**Kiyoka:** I can send the books I'm not going to be reading back home\. It's just hard to get through all by myself\.\.\. I really appreciate you being here, Juujou-san\.  
**Hiyori:** ? If you're just deciding whether you need them or not, you don't need me, do you?  
**Kiyoka:** No no no\.\.\. I'll be in big trouble if you're not here\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.If you say so?  
**Kiyoka:** For now, let's change into our jerseys then get started\. I was just about to get changed myself\. I don't really like getting my uniform dirty when I'm not on a mission\.  
**Hiyori:** That's a good idea\. Give me a minute\.  
**Kiyoka:** Thanks for helping with cleaning the windows too\.  
**Hiyori:** I'm good at helping with cleaning, so that's easy for me\. And it's over quick when there's two people\.  
**Hiyori:** Anyway, what's that you've been reading?  
**Kiyoka:** It's the teens' fashion magazine I always buy\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** That says it's the April issue, doesn't it\.\.\.?  
**Kiyoka:** Uh, about that\.\.\. I remembered I bought the skirt the model on the cover is wearing\.\.\. and then I just started flipping through the pages\.  
**Hiyori:** Weren't you going to pick out the books you're done reading to send home, and tie up the magazines for recycling\.\.\.? Honestly\.  
**Kiyoka:** You're right\.\.\. Even if I look back through them at times like these, I can't go holding onto them forever\.  
**Kiyoka:** I really should throw them away every month when I buy a new one, but\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** They come in handy for things like tips on how to coordinate, so it's hard to get rid of them\.  
**Hiyori:** Let me see those\. I'll tie up the ones around here\.  
**Kiyoka:** Please go ahead\. I knew this would happen, which is why I wanted you to come\.  
**Hiyori:** Don't sound so proud about that\.  
**Hiyori:** How's it going over there?  
**Kiyoka:** Take a look at this, on the corner of this page\! Isn't this knitted scarf so cute? It looks so soft and fluffy\.  
**Hiyori:** It'd probably look good on you\.  
**Kiyoka:** And then, there's this too, I think this chic design would look great on you, Juujou-san\!  
**Kiyoka:** Once the new year starts, we can make it our first shopping trip\.\.\. or maybe not\. But, we should go take a look together\. And we can invite some others too\.  
**Hiyori:** Sounds good\. There's still plenty of time to use a scarf this season\.  
**Hiyori:** Wait, forget that\.\.\. hand that over here too\.  
**Kiyoka:** This one's this month's issue\.\.\. so I'm not done with it yet\.  
**Hiyori:** Sigh\.\.\. Then, what should I be doing next?  
**Kiyoka:** The books stacked in front of the bookshelf are going home, so it'd help if you could put them in those cardboard boxes\.  
**Kiyoka:** I'll look for other books I don't think I'll be reading\.  
**Hiyori:** Got it\.  
**Hiyori:** Still, even for paperbacks, there's a lot more than I was expecting\.  
**Hiyori:** Nn\.\.\.? This one\.\.\. Isn't this the sequel to the novel you let me borrow before?  
**Hiyori:** I guess I can take a quick break and take a look\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** This book, I bought it and never got around to reading it\. I must have tucked it away here\.  
**Kiyoka:** I'll just take a quick peek to see what it was about\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Wha\.\.\. It ends like that? Now I'm even more interested to see what happens next\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** If you want the 3rd volume, I think it was over here\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Here you go\.  
**Hiyori:** Sure\. Thanks for finding it\.  
**Kiyoka/Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.It's been a couple hours and we haven't finished sorting anything\!?  
**Kiyoka:** I can't believe it\.\.\. Even Juujou-san got sucked in, when I called her so this wouldn't happen\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Sorry, I couldn't help myself\.\.\. I couldn't put the book down\.  
**Hiyori:** Let's hurry up and finish this\. It'll be night at this rate\.  
**Kiyoka:** No more reading until after we're done\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Yeah, we should be fine with enough self-control\. I know it\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Yeah\!  

## [Renpu High Gym Uniform - Kagari: Start\]: Picking Up Trash
**Minato:** Volunteering?  
**Kagari:** That's right, Minato-senpai\. Please be there for the volunteer trash collecting this weekend\.  
**Minato:** Uhh\.\.\.\.\.\. Sorry\! I'm actually supposed to do something with Ema this weekend\.  
**Kagari:** Yes, I already know\.  
**Minato:** \.\.\.Eh?  
**Kagari:** But, it's strange\. I'm sure I didn't see your name on the suppression request Ema-senpai and the others were handling\.\.\.  
**Minato:** \.\.\.Urgh\.  
**Yukari:** Give it up already, Minato\.  
**Kagari:** Honestly\. You aren't a child, so please stop trying to fake your way out of whatever you find annoying\.  
**Minato:** Ahaha, sorry, sorry\. So, who else is going to be there?  
**Yukari:** Yuzuki-senpai is off with the others dealing with a suppression request, so it's only you, Kagari, and I\.  
**Kagari:** Please don't run away from it, Minato-senpai\.  
**Minato:** Fiiine\.  
That weekend\.

  
**Minato:** You think we could stop here?  
**Yukari:** It hasn't even been an hour since we started collecting trash, Minato\.  
**Minato:** But I already filled up the trash bag they gave us\. So can't I just be done now?  
**Kagari:** You can't\.  
**Kagari:** We still haven't finished walking the route they specified, so please give it a little more effort\.  
**Minato:** Ehhh\.\.\.  
**Kagari:** If you filled up your trash bag, you just have to go get another one\. That's no reason to stop here\.  
**Minato:** Alright fine, I'll go get another trash bag\.  
**Yukari:** Kagari\. Do you want to take a break until Minato comes back?  
**Kagari:** No, I'll collect up the trash\. It'll be more efficient that way when Minato-senpai gets back\.  
**Kagari:** You should rest though, Yukari-sama\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.  
**Yukari:** Alright then\. Try not to push yourself too hard\.  
**Kagari:** I won't\.  

## [Renpu High Gym Uniform - Kagari: End\]: A Promise
**Kagari:** Phew, I've picked up plenty of trash, but\.\.\. Minato-senpai still hasn't come back\.  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.She's skipping out, isn't she\.  
**Minato:** Heyyy, Kagari\!  
**Yukari:** Sorry we made you wait\.  
**Kagari:** Yukari-sama, Minato-senpai\.\.\.  
**Kagari:** You were skipping, weren't you, Minato-senpai?  
**Minato:** Hey hey, don't call it that\. Anyway, come and check this out\!  
**Kagari:** Ah, Minato-senpai\! My hands are dirty, so don't\.\.\.  
**Minato:** You were working hard cleaning up trash, weren't you? So don't worry about it\.  
**Minato:** Come on, let's go\!  
**Kagari:** Wait, but, where are we going to?  
**Yukari:** You'll just have to see when we get there\.  
**Kagari:** Don't you play along with her too, Yukari-sama\!  
**Minato:** Alright, we're here\!  
**Kagari:** Ah\.\.\. The sakura petals\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** They're pretty, aren't they\.  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.They are\.  
**Minato:** See, it's a really nice day today, isn't it? I was looking around to see if there might be a good place to take a nap, when I found this\.  
**Kagari:** A nap? Didn't you leave so you could get another trash bag, Senpai?  
**Minato:** Urgh\.\.\. Help me out here, Yukari\!  
**Yukari:** Not going to\. Sometimes, you deserve to get yelled at\.  
**Minato:** You traitor\!  
**Kagari:** Let's get back to volunteering\.  
**Minato:** Ehh-\!? But, look how pretty the sakura petals are\!  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.We can come back to see them when everyone is here\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.  
**Yukari:** Sure, that sounds nice\. Right, Minato?  
**Minato:** \.\.\.Yeah, it'll be more fun with everybody making some noise\.  
**Kagari:** Ah, but since Minato-senpai didn't take collecting trash seriously, she's not allowed to come to the flower viewing\.  
**Minato:** Ehh-\!? Don't be like that\! I'll start taking it seriously\!  
**Kagari:**　I don't care\.  

## [Valentines '21 - Sayaka: Start\]: Disconcerting Chocolates
**Sayaka:** I want to make chocolates\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Chocolates? Did you bump your head or something? Why bring that up here of all places?  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san might not have any interest in these things, but for the rest of the world, it is Valentines season\.  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, I know\! What I mean is, why'd she come to you of all people for advice\! Okay\!?  
**Sayaka:** I want to give back to Mai\. She's always giving them to me\.  
**Kofuki:** Oh yeah, she's got you hand fed now\.  
**Kofuki:** But still, I get that, but why'd you come to us?  
**Sayaka:** I didn't mean you, Kofuki\. I wanted Tsugumi\. I heard that Tsugumi can cook\.  
**Kofuki:** Are you sure? The stuff she makes, it's\.\.\. like that, alright?  
**Tsugumi:** Don't worry, Shichinosato-san\. Even I know to mind the TPO\.	[Time, place, and occasion\]  
**Kofuki:** Do you\.\.\.?  
**Tsugumi:** I'll help you, Itomi-san\. Let's give it our best attempt\.  
**Sayaka:** I'll be in your care\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Guess if that's how it's going to be\.  
**Kofuki:** Oi\! I'm helping out too\! Don't go starting this on your own\!  
**Tsugumi:** First, we need to gather ingredients\.  
**Sayaka:** Okay\.  
**Tsugumi:** Now, I'll stop by the fresh fish corner\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** You're not going anywhere near there\!  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan, you're with Shichinosato-san and Tsugumi-san? That's a bit of an odd combination\.\.\. or maybe not? You're all Renpu toji, after all\. Were you out shopping?  
**Sayaka:** We were going--  
**Kofuki:** Yeah we were\. Just helping with this one's research\. Right?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes, that's how it is\.  
**Mai:** Is that why? Do your best with them, Sayaka-chan\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Mm\.  
**Sayaka:** Kofuki, why did you do that?  
**Kofuki:** Why'd I make something up? Cause, you don't want Mai to know till you give it to her, right?  
**Tsugumi:** Hmm\.\.\.?  
**Kofuki:** What's that look for\! Before, Kiyoka kept going on about how girls need surprises or whatever, and I just remembered it is all\!\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Thank you, Kofuki\.  
**Kofuki:** So make some good chocolate and give her a surprise\.  
**Sayaka:** Mm\.  

## [Valentines '21 - Sayaka: End\]: Normal Chocolates
**Tsugumi:** It should be fine now\. Test chocolate #1 is complete\.  
**Sayaka:** It's ready\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Hmm, it looks okay at least\.  
**Sayaka:** I tried my best for Mai, since she works hard every day\.  
**Tsugumi:** Now for the taste testing\. \.\.\.[chew chew\]\. Mm, it turned out well\.  
**Sayaka:** Really?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes, you could proudly serve this anywhere\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** I guess I'll give it a taste too then\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** With its nutritional value\.  
**Kofuki:** Pffpphhtt\!? This tastes like shit\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san\.\.\. That's disgusting\.  
**Kofuki:** Hey, I didn't do anything wrong here\! What the hell happened to TPO; remember TPO\!?  
**Tsugumi:** You see-, Itomi-san told me she wanted to make it nutritious-\. So yes, I provided some nutritional ingredients from my own private stockpile\.  
**Sayaka:** It would be great for Mai if she's tired\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Sigh\.  
**Kofuki:** Oi, Sayaka\. What're Mai's cookies like?  
**Sayaka:** Mai's cookies are normal cookies\. But, they're really tasty\.  
**Kofuki:** Right? So, quit thinking about nutrition and all that crap and make some normal tasty chocolates too\.  
**Sayaka:** But\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** No buts\. She's absolutely gonna be way happier if you give her that instead of something weird\.  
**Sayaka:** It'll make Mai happy\.\.\. Okay, I'll make normal chocolates\.  
**Tsugumi:** I think that would be a good idea too\. They say that cooking comes down to love, after all\.  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.You can just stop talking\.  
Valentines Day\.

  
**Mai:** Ah, Sayaka-chan\! Here you go; I made you Valentines chocolates\.  
**Sayaka:** Thank you, Mai\.

**Mai:** Eh? Sayaka-chan, you made your own chocolates for me\.\.\.?  
**Sayaka:** Mm\. Tsugumi and Kofuki helped me, and I tried my best\.  
**Sayaka:** I tried tasting it lots of times\. I made sure it was normally tasty chocolate\.\.\. I think\. Do you want to try it?  
**Mai:** Thank you, Sayaka-chan\.  
**Mai:** I'd be glad to have a bite\.\.\. Mmm, it's so good\!  
**Sayaka:** I'm happy\.\.\. Thank you for always helping me, Mai\.
