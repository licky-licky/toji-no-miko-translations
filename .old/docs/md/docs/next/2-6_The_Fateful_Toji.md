## 1: What Must be Done (1\)
**Hiyori:** HAAAAAAHH---\!  
**Yukari:** Fast\. However--  
**Hiyori:** Nng-\! She can block a storm armor powered swing one handed\!?  
**Yukari:** What, is that all you can manage?  
**Kanami:** Haah-\!  
**Kanami:** Amazing\.\.\.\! She blocked everything\!  
**Hiyori:** You monster\!  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.Hm\. The storm armor constructed for my vanguard\.  
**Yukari:** If it could contend with the elite guard infused with noro, I'd have to say it's passable\.  
**Hiyori:** That's right\! The things you created have been turned against you\!  
**Yukari:** Heh\.\.\. How amusing\.  
**Hiyori:** What\!?  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.It should be a good distraction from this tedium\.  
**Hiyori:** I'm here to finish what my mother started\! I'll destroy you\!  
**Yukari:** Give it a try\.  
**Hiyori:** This is the last thing I'll ask: Are you Origami Yukari? Or are you Tagitsuhime?  
**Yukari:** Do you have time to waste asking questions? The operational limit of your storm armor is fast approaching\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Ngh\! Kanami\! Give it everything you have\!  
**Kanami:** Right\!  
Stepping back in time a little--

  
**Yui:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.That sound\!  
**Mirja:** The final battle must be beginning\.  
**Kiyoka:** The great aradama\.\.\.  
**Yui:** What should we do, Mirja-san?  
**Mirja:** The toji who noticed what's going on may attempt to reconvene with Origami Yukari\.  
**Mirja:** We cannot allow them to interfere with their battle\. We'll need to eliminate any toji heading toward the shrine\.  
**Yui:** Got it\! Then, this is the home stretch\!  

## 2: What Must be Done (2\)
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.Go on, Maki-san\. To Yukari-sama's side\.  
**Maki:** Suzuka, you regained consciousness\.\.\.? Can you still fight?  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.Unfortunately, I no longer have the strength for it\. I'll deal with Yume's remains here\.  
**Maki:** Deal with\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** If we leave her as she is, Yume will become an aradama\.  
**Maki:** That's right\.\.\. If we just wait, Yume will get back up\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san\!  
**Suzuka:** You know better\. That's not Yume anymore\.  
**Suzuka:** All that's left of Yume is a vessel with an aradama developing inside\. If that happens, Yume will have to be killed again\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** I'll be the one to take the necessary precautions\. It would be too much for you\.  
**Maki:** Yume couldn't\.\.\. We can't even be given a normal death anymore, can we\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** We were prepared for that from the start\. From the day we accepted the aradama\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** Now, go\! First seat of the elite guard\!  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  

## 3: A Curse Called Farewell (1\)
**Hiyori:** Ngh\.\.\.\!  
**Kanami:** She's tough\.\.\.\!  
**Yukari:** What's the matter, is it over already?  
**Hiyori:** The storm armor's operating time will only last another 20 seconds-- We have to act now\!  
**Hiyori:** Kanami, we have to finish it here\!  
**Kanami:** I know\!  
Stepping back in time a little--

  
**Yukina:** I may have gotten wrapped up in Origami Akane's worthless little drama, but I'm glad I forced my way back here\. I got to see you, Sayaka\.  
**Yomi:** Pant, pant\.\.\.  
**Yukina:** You've finally grown interested in receiving Yukari-sama's power too, haven't you? In light of that, I'm willing to forgive your selfishness these past few days\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\!  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Sayaka-chan won't be going back to you\.  
**Yukina:** What's the matter, Sayaka? Fufu, there's nothing to be afraid of\. In your case--  
**Yomi:** Ugh\.\.\. Ah\.\.\.  
**Yukina:** In no way will you end up like this failure\. So there's nothing to worry about\.  
**Yukina:** Now, Sayaka, come here\. You can be Yukari-sama's faithful toji\.\.\. Rather, her okatana\.  
**Yukina:** The same as I once wielded that Myoho Muramasa you're holding\.  
**Yukina:** That's the way-- That a tool ought to behave, isn't it?  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\!  
**Mai:** How can\.\.\. How can you say that\! Sayaka-chan isn't a tool for you to use\!  
**Sayaka:** Please\.\.\. Stop\.\.\.  
**Yukina:** \.\.\.What's that?  
**Sayaka:** Please, stop doing\.\.\. Such mean things\.\.\. Otherwise\.\.\. I'll\.\.\.\!  
**Yukina:** Kill me? You will? Me? Fu, fufu\.\.\. Fufufufu\.\.\. Ahahahahaha\!  
**Yukina:** Don't get ahead of yourself\! Quit running your mouth and do as you're told\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\!  
**Mai:** You're the one who needs to stop talking, President Takatsu\. I can't approve of the way you treat people like objects\.  
**Yukina:** Huh\!?  
**Mai:** Whether it's you or Origami Yukari, I'll never\.\.\. I'll never let you do anything to Sayaka-chan\!  
**Yukina:** You're speaking nonsense\. Anyone who carries an okatana does so for Yukari-sama's sake\.  
**Yukina:** --Even this failure here understands that\!  
**Yomi:** Ah\.\.\.\!  
**Mai:** What are you\.\.\.\!?  
**Yukina:** \.\.\.Honestly, you make my skin crawl\. Ever since I chose to fool around with you in my experiments, not a day has gone by that I've had any idea what goes through that head of yours\.  
**Yukina:** Stand, Yomi\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yukina:** Well? Aren't you going to say a single thing to defend yourself?  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.I'll capture the traitors\. That's my duty, as a part of the elite guard\.  
**Yukina:** Hmph\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Satsuki-san\.\.\. Why would you go so far\.\.\.  
**Yukina:** If that's how it is, Yomi\. I'll give you this\.  
**Mai:** That's\.\.\. An ampule of noro\.\.\. Don't you care about what it'll do to your body\!?  
**Yomi:** I don't mind\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** Mai\!  
**Mai:** Okay\.\.\. Let's go, Sayaka-chan\!  
**Yukina:** Leave Sayaka alive\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.Understood\.  

## 4: A Curse Called Farewell (2\)
**Mai:** Pant\.\.\. Pant\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.It's not over yet, not yet, not yet, not yet\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.If you lose that much blood, you're going to die, you know\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.You'll be finished before then\.  
**Yukina:** Keep going, Yomi\. Their storm armor must be reaching its limit soon\.  
**Mai:** Our time is\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan\. Hold back the aradama, even for just a moment\. I'll-- Take her down\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Okay\. This power, I'll use it the way I want to\. I'll clear the way for you, Mai\.  
**Yukina:** That's\.\.\. Munen Musou\. Ahh\.\.\. Sayaka\.\.\.  
**Mai:** I see it\! The path Sayaka-chan opened up for me\. I won't waste this chance\!  
**Mai:** HYAAAAAAH-\!\!  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.Well done\.  
**Storm Armor:** Remaining battery zero, ceasing functions\. Armor will be forcibly purged\.  
**Mai:** Pant\.\.\. Pant\.\.\. We did it, Sayaka-chan\.  
**Sayaka:** Yes\.  

## 5: Tagitsuhime
**Hiyori:** Third layer-- Jin'i\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.TAAAH-\!  
**Kanami:** You did it\!?  
**Yukari:** Isn't that unfortunate\.  
**Kanami & Hiyori:** Ugh\!\!  
**Storm Armor:** Remaining battery zero, ceasing functions\. Armor will be forcibly purged\.  
**Yukari:** The limit of your storm armor\.\.\. This is as far as it could take you\.  
**Hiyori:** What happened\.\.\. I know I hit you\.\.\. Why are you still moving?  
**Hiyori:** No\.\.\. Utsushi? An aradama using utsushi\.\.\.?  
**Kanami:** The elite guard could do it too; it's not unthinkable\.  
**Yukari:** Shall we continue?  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Of course\!  
**Hiyori:** Kh\.\.\.\!  
**Kanami:** I'll take the lead this time\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Okay\!  
**Kanami:** HAAAH-\! HAH-\! HA-\!  
**Kanami:** Kh\.\.\. I can't break her guard\! But--  
**Hiyori:** Now\! HAAAAAAAH-\!\!  
**Yukari:** How futile\.  
**Hiyori:** I don't believe it\.\.\. How did she stop that\!? Our timing was perfect\!  
**Kanami:** What\.\.\. Yukari-sama's eyes are glowing yellow\!?  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.I've re-evaluated you two\. Without your armor, you're still on the level of the elite guard\. Maybe greater\.  
**Hiyori:** How\!? It's like she's--  
**Kanami:** Predicting all our moves\!  
**Yukari:** That's right\. I can see it-- The future\.  
**Kanami & Hiyori:** \!?  
**Yukari:** My eyes see all\. Your strength, your secrets, your thoughts\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** I can see all outcomes, and from there, create the best one\.  
**Yukari:** Am I Origami Yukari? Am I Tagitsuhime? I will answer what you asked before\.  
**Yukari:** I am Tagitsuhime\.  
**Yukari:** Yet, I am also Origami Yukari\. We have become one\.  
**Kanami:** Tagitsuhime\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan\!  
**Kanami:** Mai-chan, and Sayaka-chan\!  
**Sayaka:** That's, the great aradama\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** Kanami\.\.\. I'm\.\.\. Scared\.\.\. This is the first time I've felt scared of my opponent\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Me too\. I'm scared too\.  

## 6: The Truth Told
**Maki:** That's impossible\.\.\. All the noro stored here is gone?  
**Ellen:** Are you starting to figure out what's going on?  
**Maki:** You\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.What's this place?  
**Ellen:** A bunker for storing all the noro the Origami family collected\. Twenty years of noro were stored here\. Until a few hours ago\.  
**Kaoru:** So all of it came together and brought back that monster, huh\.  
**Kaoru:** Oi, you\. You're with the elite guard, right? Take responsibility for this\.  
**Maki:** By running a continuous electric current through it, noro doesn't appear on the spectrum\. Compared to isolating it as offerings across the country, this was a much safer method of management\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.Sorry, but that's all false info\. All that happened was Tagitsuhime had the noro under her control playing dead\.  
**Maki:** Wha\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** For the last 20 years the country's been getting duped; everyone out there working hard gathering noro for her\.  
**Maki:** But, since the Origami family took control, there's been a sharp decrease in aradama related incidents\. And the number of deaths among toji\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** All of it was an act leading up to today\.  
**Maki:** \.\.\.But every year, there were still victims\. No matter how much we kill them and kill them, impurities keep forming aradama that seep out of the shadows\.  
**Maki:** To fight that, we needed the same power\. To fight poison with poison\.\.\. To harness that impurity was the only way to stop it\.  
**Ellen:** And that's a reason to accept the aradama?  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.You're just scared\.  
**Maki:** \!  
**Kaoru:** It's thanks to cowards like you that aradama started getting hated as impure in the first place\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Kaoru:** What?  
**Ellen:** Watch out; the ceiling's collapsing\!  
**Kanami & Hiyori:** Pant\.\.\. Pant\.\.\.\!  
**Kanami:** Ughh\.\.\. The floor fell through\.\.\. What is this\.\.\.? This is what was under the shrine\.\.\.?  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Oh? Over there\.\.\. Kaoru-chan, Ellen-chan\!  
**Sayaka:** Pant, pant\.\.\. Mai, are you okay?  
**Mai:** Yes, I managed somehow\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.Our enemy's wielding six swords\. That's just perfect, cause there's six of us\!  
**Kaoru:** And one pet\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Yukari:** That's Yukari-sama\.\.\.? No, that's\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Everyone, get in sync\. Remember our group fighting at the village\!  
**Kanami:** Look sharp, listen close, and follow your instincts\.  
**Sayaka:** I'll put everything that came before into my sword\.  
**Ellen:** And when we win, it's happily ever after\!  
**Kaoru:** This time for sure we're getting a long vacation\.  
**Yukari:** The ones who birthed aradama were you humans\.  
**Yukari:** You are who tore apart what was once one\. You would call me impure, fear me, despise me\.  
**Yukari:** Tamahagane and noro\. Okatana and aradama\. Pure and impure\. All began as one, all are the same\. The distinction only exists because humans decided they had the right to separate them\.  
**Yukari:** Even amidst the spreading disaster, my intelligence continued to evolve\. Before long, I could see there was only one outcome\.  
**Yukari:** I, who had been transformed into a god of calamity, would one day be destroyed by human hands\.  
**Kanami & Hiyori:** \!  
**Yukari:** I sought a way to survive\. And twenty years ago I made my attempt, during the "Great Disaster of Sagami Bay"\.  

## 20 years ago\. Enoshima Shrine Okutsumiya--
**Tagitsuhime:** If I must have a name, you may call me Tagitsuhime\.  
**Yukari:** You mean, confining you here in Enoshima\.\.\. And sending in the Special Task Team\.\.\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** Correct, Origami Yukari\. All of it, only an act to draw you here\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** For the greatest chance of my survival\. I did it on your behalf\.  
**Fujiwara Minato:** Yukari, don't listen to a word that thing says\! We're going to beat it\! That's all we have to do\!  
**Yukari:** But\.\.\. To do that\.\.\.  
**Hiiragi Kagari:** Yukari-sama, please give the order\. To fulfill my duty\.  
**Minato:** Duty?  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.Please, Kagari\. Seal Tagitsuhime\.\.\.  
**Kagari:** Understood\. \.\.\.I'm sorry you had to make such a painful decision\.  
**Kagari:** The days in school we all shared, they're a treasure I wouldn't trade for the world\.  
**Yukari:** Kh\.\.\.  
**Kagari:** Minato-senpai\.\.\. To tell the truth, I had a hard time dealing with you\. However, in this moment, I'm so\.\.\. So grateful to you\.  
**Minato:** Kagari\.\.\.?  
**Kagari:** Tagitsuhime\.\.\.\! I will seal you away\! That is what I'm here to do\!  
**Kagari:** HAAAAAAAAH-\!\!  
**Minato:** Kagari's single sword connected with Tagitsuhime\.\.\.\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** Meaningless\. A scratch like that will not--  
**Kagari:** I'll drag you down with me, to the ends of the netherworld-\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** OOOOOOOOOHHH--\!  
**Minato:** \.\.\.Kagari\!  
**Kagari:** Minato\.\.\. Senpai\.\.\.?  
**Minato:** Take\.\.\. My hand\!  
**Kagari:** \.\.\.I can't\. If I do, you'll\.\.\.  
**Minato:** Just take it\! Kagari\!  
**Kagari:** Minato-senpai\.\.\.\!  
**Minato:** In exchange\.\.\. I'll take on half of it\! So just let me\.\.\. Let me save you, Kagari\!  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.Kagari\.\.\. Minato\! Why\.\.\. Why\.\.\.\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** Origami Yukari\. I propose a deal\.  
**Yukari:** A deal\.\.\.?  
**Tagitsuhime:** Dragged to the netherworld like this, my sense of self will be extinguished\. When that occurs, I will be unable to return for decades\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** Nevertheless, while I will lose my self, my existence is undying\. One day I will seep from the netherworld and return to this one\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** As one of the Origami family, who has long repeated this course, you must know\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.And what do you propose?  
**Tagitsuhime:** Become one with me\. If so, Hiiragi Kagari and Fujiwara Minato's lives will be spared\.  
**Yukari:** What\.\.\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** While we are one, I will lie in the shallows of the netherworld and cure my wounds\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** Greater than these decades, my recovery will be prolonged\. If you can destroy me in the time that gives you, you will have won\.  
**Yukari:** That offer is insane\.\.\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** The likelihood of your accepting is decisively high\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** The only way to suppress a great aradama is to sacrifice yourself by dragging it to the netherworld with you\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** That was Hiiragi Kagari\.\.\. That was my mother's mission\. But, my mother returned to this world\.  
**Hiyori:** You're saying that was all thanks to Kanami's mother, Fujiwara Minato, and the contract formed between Origami Yukari and Tagitsuhime?  
**Tagitsuhime:** The Origami family had passed this duty down unfailingly\. However, Yukari chose to have those two returned\.  

## 7: Conclusion (1\)
**Mihono:** There's the head of the family, and\.\.\. Kanami\!?  
**Chie:** It looks like we made it in time\.  
**Hana:** That's the great aradama\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Ahh, it's crazy\! Never felt anything like this pressure\!  
**Yukari:** Regardless of how many you bring, the outcome will be the same\. Be crushed by despair\.  
**Kanami:** Gghh-\!  
**Mihono:** Kanami-\!\!  
**Kanami:** Ugh\.\.\. Ughh\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** You truly were Fujiwara Minato's daughter\. One day you might have grown fearsomely skillful\.  
**Yukari:** But you are only a fledgling\. Far from the likes of Minato\.  
**Yukari:** Now-- What will you do\. Use the same technique as your mother? If you can strike me with that okatana\.\.\. That is\.  
**Hiyori:** Kh-\!  
**Yukari:** Resign yourself\. Your sword cannot reach me\. There is no toji in this world capable of surpassing Origami Yukari--  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Kanami\!?  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** Oh, you still have the strength to stand, at least--  
**Kanami:** Yukari\! Long time no see\!  
**Yukari:** Minato\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Fufu\.  
**Hiyori:** Kanami\.\.\.?  
**Yukari:** Impossible\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** Impossible\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Totally possible\!  
**Hiyori:** Kanami\!  
**Yukari:** Impossible, Fujiwara Minato is dead\!  
**Kanami:** Seems like it\!  
**Kanami:** But, I'm still fighting here\!  
**Mihono:** Amazing\.\.\. It's completely one-sided\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** This future shouldn't exist\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** Ghh\.\.\.\!  
**Chie:** There's fire coming from where she's been cut\!  
**Kofuki:** I've got no clue what's going on, but that's awesome\! She's on fire\!  

## 8: Conclusion (2\)
**Yukari:** Nngh\.\.\. For this to happen\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** It's now or never\!  
**Yukari:** Fourth stage\.\.\. Jin'i\.\.\.?  
**Hiyori:** This is\.\.\. My true single sword\!  
**Yukari:** Well done\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** HAAAAAAAHHH----\!  
**Hiyori:** You will descend with me to the depths of the netherworld\!  
**Kanami:** Don't, Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** Let go, let go of me, Kanami\!  
**Kanami:** No\! I'm never letting go\!  
**Mihono:** Look\! From where Kogarasumaru came through her back\.\.\. She's cracking open\.\.\.\!  
**Kofuki:** The hell's going on\!? All the aradama is gushing up like a geyser\!  
**Chie:** The aradama blowing out is splitting across the sky\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Tagitsuhime's\.\.\.\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Disappearing\.  
That night, as Tagitsuhime fled to the netherworld, the aradama she discarded shot up into the sky\.

  
As it flew, it began to rain down across all of Kanto\. Like shooting stars it shone\.
