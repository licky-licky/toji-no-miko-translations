## [Police Officer - Kofuki: Start\]: A Risky Pick for an Officer for a Day
**Kofuki:** Sighhh, even if it's all just police work in the end, I'm bored out of my mind not getting any aradama-chan to beat around\.  
**Kofuki:** I mean, we're only here for this "aradama safety awareness campaign", so why do we gotta work on all this stuff besides that?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.There's nothing we can do about itt\. We're still civil servants too\.  
**Police Officer:** Sorry to keep you waiting\. We were thinking over who you could help out with\.\.\.  
**Police Officer:** If there's any kind of job you'd like to try, you can go ahead and volunteer yourselves\.  
**Kofuki:** You'll let us do whatever we want\!? Then I want to fire off a gun, like, blam blam\!  
**Kofuki:** If I'm not gonna get to beat any aradama, then shooting the crap outta something'd still make me feel way better\!  
**Police Officer:** Shoot the crap out of something\.\.\. You know\.\.\. We don't really do that here\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Sigh\. Shichinosato-san, there's no way they would make temporary helpers like us do something so dangerouss\.  
**Kofuki:** Why not; that's so lame\. Then, lemme tear around town in a cop car\!  
**Kofuki:** I've always wanted to blast the sirens and run red lights and all that\.  
**Kofuki:** That's gotta feel real cool, right?  
**Police Officer:** \.\.\.That's only something we do during emergencies, when there's no other choice, not for joyriding\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I'm sorry; Shichinosato-san might need traffic laws explained to her all over from the very basicss\.  
**Police Officer:** Maybe you're right\. Actually\.\.\. I know\! Let's have you be a crossing guard\.  
**Kofuki:** A crossing what?  
**Police Officer:** It's to keep the kids going to and home from school safe; you stand at road crossings on the school route and make sure people drive safe\.  
**Kofuki:** Huhh\!? Why do I gotta do a lame job like that\.\.\.   
**Hirona:** Isn't it be cause you keep saying you want to do dangerous things, like shooting a gun, or racing a carr?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.You get to help the police while they're shorthanded and learn the importance of traffic safety; that's a great logical place for youu\.  
**Police Officer:** Now that that's decided, let's get you over there quickly\. The kids have morning classes today, so they should be going home right around now\.  
**Hirona:** Do your bestt\.  
**Kofuki:** Wait, you're not coming either\!? What the hell\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** The station sent me over, I'm Shichinosato Kofuki\.  
**Traffic Officer:** I've been waiting for you\. Alright, you can stand here at the corner of this intersection\.  
**Traffic Officer:** The kids should be coming home along this road any minute, so give them a good greeting and make sure they watch out for the lights, okay?  
**Kofuki:** Yeah sure\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Ughh-, if I skip on this, Mirja and Chichie'll be pissed later, so I guess I'll just half-ass it\.  
**Kofuki:** Ahh-, I miss my aradama-chan\.\.\.  

## [Police Officer - Kofuki: End\]: A Reliable Officer for a Day?
**Kofuki:** Hey-, the brats finally made it\. C'mon, c'mon, get over there already-\. It's gonna be red soon-\.  
**Kofuki:** (Sigh\.\.\. This job's so boring\. Like, there's not even any cars coming through here\. What's the point in making me stand around here?\)  
**Elementary Schooler 1:** Good morning, miss police lady\!  
**Kofuki:** P-Police lady\!?  
**Kofuki:** (Oh yeah, I'm still wearing the police uniform, so they just think I'm an officer\.\)  
**Elementary Schooler 2:** Police lady, are you a new police lady? You're not very good at saying hello\.  
**Elementary Schooler 1:** The usual police lady is always really nice when she says hi to us-\.  
**Kofuki:** Huhh\!? What'd you\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** (Wait, crap\. If they find out I lost it at a couple of kids, Mirja and Chichie are gonna flip out\.\)  
**Kofuki:** (Alright fine, just for this, I'll play along and put on a nice police lady act\.\)  
**Kofuki:** Sorry 'bout that-\. I'm just a new police lady, so I still haven't got the hang of this\.  
**Kofuki:** See, the light's green\. So take care and go on over-\.  
**Kofuki:** Not like any cars are coming anyway\.   
**Kofuki:** Nn? I guess a bike's coming up though\. Tch, they must be having fun, both of them riding together talking about whatever\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Nn\.\.\.? What're they doing coming into the intersection\!? It's red right now\.  
**Kofuki:** Shit, they're gonna crash into the kids crossing over\!  
**Kofuki:** Oi, hold it\! STOP THE BIKE, WOULD YA---\!  
**Kofuki:** I said stop, damnit\!  
**Kofuki:** Sigh, now you stop\. Could you at least look where you're going\!? And you're not allowed to double up on a bike, y'know\!?  
**Kofuki:** This is a school road, okay\!? What're you gonna do if you ran over some kid\!? How're you gonna make up for that\!? Huhh\!?  
**High School Girl 1:** We're sorry\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Don't let me catch you ever sharing a bike again\! And you better watch the lights next time\. Even the freaking elementary schoolers know this stuff\!  
**High School Girl 2:** Yes ma'am, we'll be careful\.  
**Elementary Schooler 1:** You did it, police lady\!  
**Elementary Schooler 2:** It was really cool how you scolded them\.  
**Kofuki:** What, you saw all that?  
**Elementary Schooler 1:** Those onee-sans never pay attention to the lights\. We tell them, you shouldn't do that, but they never listen to us\.  
**Kofuki:** Seriously\.\.\.? They're repeat offenders, huh\.  
**Elementary Schooler 2:** Thank you for scolding them, miss police lady\.  
**Elementary Schooler 1:** I'm glad you're here\. Thank you\.  
**Kofuki:** I-It's not anything you've gotta thank me for\.\.\. Look, the light's still green, so look both ways and walk across already\.  
**Elementary Schooler 1:** Okaaay, see you later, miss police lady\!  
**Elementary Schooler 2:** Good luck with your work-\!  
**Kofuki:** S-Sure\. Thanks\.  
**Kofuki:** (I thought this job'd be all boring, but maybe it's not so bad\.\)

## [Police Officer - Ellen: Start\]: You Won't Get Away With Any Parking Violations\!
**Ellen:** Our first job for the aradama safety awareness campaign went smoothly, but what should we be doing next?  
**Police PR Official:** From here, we'd like you to help with each of the other departments, so could you go see what the traffic department needs, Kohagura-san?  
**Ellen:** I'm on it\!  
**Ellen:** I'm Kohagura Ellen, here to help\! I'll be in your care\!  
**Traffic Officer:** That's a nice upbeat attitude\! Then, if I could get right to it, I'll explain what we need your help with\.  
**Traffic Officer:** There's a lot of cars parking on the streets around here, so we're stepping up our regulation of parking violations\. Do you think you could come around as my assistant today?  
**Ellen:** Sure thing\!  
**Traffic Officer:** Ah, looks like I've already spotted a parking violation there\. Let's go over\.  
**Ellen:** Okay\! I see, so that's a parking ticket\.  
**Traffic Officer:** If you get one of these, you'll have to pay a fine and points get deducted from your license\. There's no good that comes from it\.  
**Driver:** Ah-\! Hang on a minute\! I was only parked here for a second, so could you overlook it?  
**Traffic Officer:** Sorry, but those are the rules\. There's signs that clearly state this is a no parking zone\.  
**Driver:** I was back in no time though; I just had to do a little shopping\. Was I bothering anybody?  
**Traffic Officer:** This is a vital location in case an emergency vehicle needs to make a stop here\. Even if you weren't here for long, it still isn't allowed\.  
**Driver:** Tch\.\.\. You want to fill your quota that bad? You're just tax thieves\! Who do you think's paying your salaries\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Traffic Officer:** Okay, thanks for your cooperation\. Please drive safely now\.  
**Ellen:** They just left\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** I can't believe how rude they were\! They're the ones who broke the rules, so how can they act like that\.\.\.  
**Traffic Officer:** It's just the way it is\. We hear that stuff all the time, so I'm fine with it, but are you alright, Kohagura-san?  
**Ellen:** I'm fine\. It was kind of a sucker punch, but\.\.\. I can tell just what you police officers have to go through\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.\.\.\.?  
**Traffic Officer:** What's wrong? Did you notice something?  
**Ellen:** Just now, I thought I saw somebody watching us from behind that building\.\.\.  
**Traffic Officer:** Oh dear, do you think it's trouble?  
**Ellen:** I must have imagined it\. Anyway, we have a job to do\!  
**Traffic Officer:** We managed to crack down on a lot of cars in such a short period of time\. You've been a real help, Kohagura-san, since you catch on so quick\.  
**Ellen:** Thanks a lot\. Though, I'm surprised how whenever we give someone a ticket, they're always so insulting to us\.  
**Traffic Officer:** From their perspective, we're more like sworn enemies coming out of nowhere to hit them with a fine\.  
they're suddenly getting hit with a fine, 

  
**Traffic Officer:** But, even if they hate us for it, we have to keep the town safe around here\.  
**Ellen:** It sure sounds like a tough job\.\.\. Hm\.\.\.? I think someone's watching us after all\.\.\.  
**Traffic Officer:** I could tell just now too\. Like someone's watching from behind the trees on the side of the road\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Someone stubbornly watching us from afar\. I wonder who would do that\.\.\.  

## [Police Officer - Ellen: End\]: The Source of the Suspicious Gaze\.\.\.
**Ellen:** Do you think it's maybe someone holding a grudge against us for giving them a ticket\.\.\.?  
**Traffic Officer:** I can't deny the possibility\. But, even if someone holds a grudge against us, we're just doing our job\.  
**Ellen:** That's right\! I'll do what I can to help out too\. And, if it comes down to it, I'll keep you safe too\.  
**Traffic Officer:** I feel safer already\.  
**Traffic Officer:** \.\.\.\! They're watching us again\! From inside that car this time\.  
**Ellen:** In a car? Which one?  
**Traffic Officer:** There, the car that just stopped at the parking lot on the corner\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Wait, that car\.\.\.\!?  
**Traffic Officer:** We'd better not wait for them to try anything; let's question the driver\.  
**Ellen:** Wow\! Please hang on a minute\! I know that car\.\.\.\!  
**Traffic Officer:** Could I have a word with you, sir?  
**Traffic Officer:** Can you tell us what you were doing parking your car here?  
**Ellen:** Wow\! I knew it\! I'm sorry about all this, officer\!  
**Traffic Officer:** What's wrong, Kohagura-san? What are you apologizing for?  
**Ellen:** This is my\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Grandpa\!  
**Traffic Officer:** Grandpa\.\.\. He's your grandfather\!?  
**Friedman:** I am\. Nice to meet you\. I'm Ellen's grandfather, Richard Friedman\.  
**Ellen:** Grandpa, what are you doing here\!?  
**Friedman:** I was having a look at you on your police duty\.  
**Ellen:** Were you also the one watching us from behind the building before too?  
**Traffic Officer:** And from behind the trees by the side of the road\.\.\.?  
**Friedman:** That was me\. I thought that I shouldn't go coming up to talk to you while you were working\.  
**Traffic Officer:** Is that all it was\.\.\. That's good to hear, right, Kohagura-san?  
**Ellen:** It's a relief, but\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Don't go doing something so misleading, Grandpa\!  
**Friedman:** Sorry, sorry\. Though, I have to say, Ellen, you look very good in that police uniform\.  
**Friedman:** And you were on top of your work too; it was like watching a real police officer go about their business\.  
**Ellen:** Grandpa\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** But still, secretly peeping on someone is against the rules\!  
**Ellen:** If you do that again, I'm giving you a ticket, Grandpa\!  
**Friedman:** Now that would be bad\. I'll get permission beforehand next time\.

## [Police Officer - Kaoru: Start\]: Police and a Mountain Hunt\!?
**Police PR Official:** Mashiko-san, something came up we want your help with, so could you head out to the mountains out back as soon as you can?  
**Kaoru:** The mountains out back? We're doing police work in the mountains now?  
**Police PR Official:** You'll hear the details from the officers at the scene, so if you could hurry\.  
**Kaoru:** Anyway, I'm here to help\. Toji Mashiko and Nene here\.  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Police Officer:** Good, you made it\. I'll get right to explaining the details of this mountain hunt here\.  
**Kaoru:** M-Mountain hunt\!? Did aradama show up out there or something\.\.\.?  
**Police Officer:** No, it's nothing like that\. We got a call saying someone who went hiking out here went missing\.  
**Police Officer:** All available investigators were asked to help with the search\.  
**Kaoru:** I see\.\.\. That makes sense then\.  
**Kaoru:** Though, they told us toji we were here today to help with an "aradama safety awareness campaign"\.\.\.  
**Police Officer:** We didn't think we'd be bringing a toji into this either\.\.\.  
**Police Officer:** But, when we checked with your superiors, Mashiko-san, they said mountain hunts are your specialty, and offered by all means to let you come along\.  
**Kaoru:** My superiors\.\.\. It's that old hag again\.\.\. Even when she's sending me to work for somebody else, she's still got to give me extra work\.\.\.  
**Police Officer:** For now, we want you to walk around the mountain and search with a police dog\. Make sure you've got a good grip on the leash and follow along\.  
**Police Dog:** Woof woof\!  
**Kaoru:** Ohh, the doggie's looking ready to go\. Don't make me work too hard then\.  
**Police Dog:** Woof woof\!  
**Kaoru:** Wait, wait up\.\.\.\! [pant\.\.\. pant\.\.\.\] Do they not teach police dogs about taking breaks or what?  
**Nene:** Neneee\.\.\.  
**Police Dog:** Woof woof\! Woof woof\!  
**Kaoru:** Nn? What'd you suddenly stop and start barking for? Did you smell something in the brush here\.\.\.? Anybody in there-? If you're there, say something-\!  
**Police Officer:** Hm? Just another tanuki, huh\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Oi, doggie, if you're gonna be running us all over the place, you're sure you're actually sniffing out the trail, right?  
**Police Dog:** Whine\.\.\. Whine\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** The heck; you're not exactly sounding confident now\.  
**Police Officer:** Hmm, now this is an issue\. Since we're not finding anything, I think the police dog's started losing motivation\.  
**Kaoru:** I understand exactly how the doggie feels\. My motivation's dropping real close to zero too\.  
**Kaoru:** But, if you don't find this hiker, we're never getting off this mountain\. Think you could give it one more shot\.\.\.?  
**Kaoru:** Guess talking wouldn't do any good\. Sigh, what can we do\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Nene-\! Nenee\!  
**Kaoru:** Hm? What's up, Nene? Did you come up with some kinda idea\!?  

## [Police Officer - Kaoru: End\]: Racing Around With a Police Dog\!
**Nene:** Nenee, nenene\! Nee, nene\!  
**Police Dog:** Whine\.\.\. Whine\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Nenee, nenene\! Nee, nene\!  
**Kaoru:** Nene, you managing to cheer up the doggie?  
**Nene:** Nenee, nenene\! Ne, nenee\!  
**Police Dog:** Woof\!  
**Kaoru:** Ohh\! The light's back in its eyes\!  
**Police Officer:** Now they should be up to it again\. Thank you, Nene-chan\.  
**Nene:** Nenee\!  
**Kaoru:** Alright, before the doggie gives up again, guess we'll have to put in a little more effort\.  
**Police Dog:** Woof\!  
**Police Officer:** Let's get the search back underway\. Ready\! Go\!  
**Police Dog:** Woof woof woof\!  
**Kaoru:** Whoa; they suddenly got a burst of energy\. If I let go of the leash, they'd be gone in no time\. You keeping up alright, Nene?  
**Nene:** Nenee\!  
**Kaoru:** Hey--\! Since when did you get a free ride on the doggie's head?  
**Kaoru:** Lucky you; if I were that small too, then\.\.\. pant, pant\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Crap, I don't have the stamina to go running from reality too\. Pant, pant\.\.\. What do you think now, doggie?  
**Police Dog:** Woof\! Woof woof\! Woof woof\!  
**Police Officer:** What is it? Is there something on the other side of that thicket?  
**Police Dog:** Woof\!  
**Police Officer:** Anybody, is anybody there-?  
**Missing Person:** Please help meee\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** They're here\!  
**Nene:** Neneneee---\!  
**Police Officer:** We managed to safely find them because of your help\. Thanks for being here\.  
**Kaoru:** If you're thanking anybody, thank Nene and the doggie\. All I did was get dragged along\.  
**Police Officer:** Well, we only had Nene-chan here thanks to you, Mashiko-san\. We really are grateful\.  
**Police Officer:** I'll make sure to send back a good report to your superior who recommended you to us as well\.  
**Kaoru:** Gegh, do me a favor and don't\. I don't want her doubling down on giving me a reputation for dealing in mountain hunts\.\.\.

## [Police Officer - Hiyori: Start\]: Aim to Be a Charismatic Interrogator\!
**Detective:** Juujou-san, sorry to spring this on you, but could you act as an aid in an interrogation now?  
**Hiyori:** An aid in an interrogation? Wasn't our job today to help with the "aradama safety awareness campaign"?  
**Detective:** That's what we'd planned, but the female officer in charge of this had to leave on urgent business\.  
**Detective:** I've been looking for another female officer to take her place, but I'm having trouble finding any available\.  
**Hiyori:** Why does it need to be a female officer?  
**Detective:** The higher ups have said we need to have a female aid present when interrogating female suspects\. Do you think you could help with that?  
**Hiyori:** Still\.\.\. I'm just a toji\. Is it really okay to put me in charge of an interrogation?  
**Detective:** Don't worry about it, the toji are still a part of the police\. And besides, the suspect is around your age, so maybe she'd be more willing to talk to you\.  
**Hiyori:** If you're sure about it, then\.\.\. I'll do what I can\.  
**Detective:** Great\. There's a summary of info on the suspect and her case in these papers, so once you're finished reading over it, come to the interrogation room next door\.  
**Hiyori:** Will I really be able to handle this\.\.\. If I'm being honest, I'm not all that confident, but I already said yes, so I might as well do whatever I can\.  
**Hiyori:** First off, I should read the papers on the suspect\. Hmm\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** The suspect is a member of a fraud group\.\.\. She calls elderly people over the phone, pretending to be their daughter or granddaughter, and tricks them into transferring large sums of money to her\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** How could you scam the elderly like that\!? On top of that, during interrogations, she remained silent and denied any involvement\!?  
**Hiyori:** This seems like a tough person to go up against, but I'll try whatever I can to make them confess\.  
**Hiyori:** Excuse me, I'm Juujou, taking over for the aid\.  
**Detective:** Right, good to have you\. You can take that seat\. We'll be continuing with the interrogation now\. You say you're sure that you aren't committing any kind of fraud?  
**Suspect:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** (Hm, just like the papers said, she's adamant about staying silent\.\)  
**Detective:** Hmm\.\.\. If you stay silent throughout all this, we're never going to be able to settle anything\.  
**Detective:** We're at a stalemate\.\.\. Juujou-san, you're about the same age as her, could you try saying something to her?  
**Hiyori:** Wh-What should I talk about though\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** (Mmm, at times like these, what would a natural interrogator do\.\.\. A natural interrogator would\.\.\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (Ah--\! I know; I'll give that a try\. First, I'll go over to the window\.\.\.\)  
**Detective:** Hm? What's the matter? Why are you playing with the blinds?  
**Hiyori:** The sun sure is bright today\.\.\. What a beautiful blue sky\. Somewhere out there, back where you're from, your family must be living under that same sky\.  
**Detective:** What's this all of a sudden?  
**Hiyori:** If your mother back home found out you'd been scamming people, don't you think she'd be heartbroken?  
**Hiyori:** If you're going to pay for your crimes, you'd better do it sooner than later\. Why don't you tell us the honest truth?  
**Suspect:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** (Kgh\.\.\. Why? Why isn't she giving any kind of response? In the detective drama I saw with Kanami and everyone the other day, that got the suspect to talk\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (Gh\.\.\. What else could I do to make her open up\.\.\. What seems like it could work\.\.\.\)  
**Hiyori:** Ah--\! I've got it; how about this then\!  

## [Police Officer - Hiyori: End\]: The Secret Plan to Get Her Talking is\.\.\.\!?
**Detective:** Juujou-san, did you come up with something?  
**Hiyori:** Yes, I was just thinking, maybe she's feeling hungry now?  
**Hiyori:** If someone's hungry, it doesn't matter who they are, they start to close themselves off and don't feel like talking\.  
**Hiyori:** Let's take a break and order some food\. If she could have something like katsudon, she'd probably be feeling better\. What do you think? Do you like katsudon?  
**Suspect:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** (Ohh\! She nodded\. She's still not talking, but this tactic looks like it's working\.\)  
**Hiyori:** Detective, let's order some katsudon soon\.  
**Detective:** Um, Juujou-san, could we talk outside?  
**Detective:** There's nothing wrong with ordering food during the interrogation, but the suspect will have to pay for their own expenses\.  
**Hiyori:** W-Wait, really\.\.\.\!? In the drama I saw, it made it seem like the police paid for it\.\.\.  
**Detective:** That's how it used to go\. Nowadays, if you don't give the suspect a clear explanation first and order it with their understanding, it can  cause issues later\.  
**Hiyori:** I had no idea\.\.\. She was just starting to open up too\. I can't just tell her now, "but you'll have to pay for it, okay?"  
**Detective:** I know what you mean\. Though, if it's absolutely necessary, the police doing the interrogation will pay for it themselves\.  
そうだよね。あとは、どうしてもって事ならば取り調べる側が自腹を切ることになるんだが。

  
**Hiyori:** Pay for it ourselves\.\.\. Hmm, I've been spending a lot this month, so I don't have much left over\.\.\.  
**Detective:** It's not realistic to expect a confession because of a bowl of katsudon anyway\. We should come up with something else\. Let's go back into the interrogation room\.  
**Hiyori:** Hang on a moment\. If that's how it is, then please let me get her something else\.  
**Hiyori:** Sorry for making you wait\. Some things happened, and we couldn't get you any katsudon\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Don't look so disappointed though\. Maybe having this would make you feel better instead?  
**Suspect:** \.\.\.\!\!  
**Hiyori:** For lunch, I brought natto rice today\. There's warm miso soup too, so eat your fill, and then we can talk\.  
**Detective:** (This isn't something so simple that a bowl of natto rice would get her talking though\.\.\.\)  
**Detective:** (Ah--\! The suspect started scarfing it down\. The look on her face, it's completely different from before\.\)  
**Hiyori:** So? It's good, isn't it? I pay extra attention to how many times I mix it, to bring out more umami\.  
**Suspect:** \.\.\.It tastes just like mom makes\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** (Alright\.\.\. she spoke\! Okay, just stay calm\. Don't rush it, wait for your chance\.\.\.\)  
**Hiyori:** I see\.\.\. We have all the time you need here\. Savor it all you want\.  
**Suspect:** Uuuu\.\.\. It's good\.\.\. It's good\.\.\. Mom\.\.\. I'm sorry\.\.\. I'm really sorry\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Wh-What's gotten into you? Here, take my handkerchief\. You can wipe your tears\.  
**Suspect:** Uuuu\.\.\. Thanks\.\.\. I'm sorry\.\.\. I\.\.\. I did it\.  
**Detective:** W-We finally got a confession\! Thank you, for being honest with us\. But, what made you feel like talking all of a sudden?  
**Suspect:** Because, this flavor\.\.\. it reminded me of my mom\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Is that right\. I'm just glad this natto was good for something\. You'd better not try scamming someone ever again\.  
**Suspect:** Uuuu\.\.\. I won't\. I'm really sorry\.  
**Hiyori:** (I never expected it to go so smoothly, but all's well that ends well\.\)  
**Hiyori:** (I'll just keep quiet about how her katsudon turned into natto because of budget reasons\.\)
