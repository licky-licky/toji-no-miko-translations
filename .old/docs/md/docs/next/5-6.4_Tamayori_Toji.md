## 12: Chie and Makoto (1\)
**Ellen:** From what you told me, I had my guard up, but they let us through like it's no big deal\.  
**Chie:** Y-You're not wrong\.\.\. But, last time, they wouldn't even let us enter the grounds\.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** This visit came with an official notice from Akane-sama\. Even Hitakami Makoto wouldn't have outright refused us\.  
**Friedman:** We'll have to give our thanks to Akane-sama then\.  
**Makoto:** I'm sorry to keep you waiting\.  
**Makoto:** It's a pleasure to meet you, Dr\. Friedman\.  
**Friedman:** Right, it's good to meet you\. You did turn me down when we were going to debate on TV\. So I was looking forward to today\.  
**Makoto:** I had hoped to hear your advice in a more worthwhile environment, not something like that\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.Would you lend us your knowledge, in order to treat the toji who assisted with the experiments?  
**Friedman:** I would be glad to\.  
**Makoto:** Thank you very much\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.Chie? Is Makoto really a bad guy? She sure doesn't seem like it\.\.\. (whispered\)  
**Chie:** I-I know\.\.\. She isn't any different from the Makoto I remember\.\.\. (whispered\)  
**Makoto:** In that case, we'll lead you to the research facility\.  
**Lab Worker:** Dr\. Friedman, if you'd come with me\.  
**Friedman:** Sure, lead the way\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.  
**Friedman:** Oh? You won't be coming with us, Hitakami-kun?  
**Makoto:** No, I'm afraid I'd only get in the way of a more technical discussion\.  
**Suzuka:** \.\.\.I'll be going along with Dr\. Friedman\.  
**Suzuka:** Setouchi-san, Kohagura-san, you should hear what you need to from Hitakami-san\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.Makoto\.  
**Makoto:** It's been too long, Chie-san\. I'm glad\.\.\. to meet with you again\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.I'd rather something else brought us back together, if I could help it\.  
**Makoto:** You mean what happened with Asakura Mihono-san, don't you\.  
**Makoto:** I would like to apologize for the somewhat aggressive methods we took with her\.  
**Makoto:** However, Chie-san\. I don't believe we were entirely wrong\.  
**Makoto:** If we consider Asakura-san's circumstances, it's a fact that she would be better situated here with us\.  
**Chie:** You're not the one who gets to decide that\.  
**Makoto:** If you only follow your emotions, you won't be there in time for her\.  
**Chie:** Makoto\!  
**Ellen:** Please calm down, Chie\.  
**Ellen:** Makoto, I think you've already realized, but we came here to ask you to stop using tamayori toji\.  
**Makoto:** That would be the only reason for you to come meet with me now, wouldn't it\.  
**Makoto:** However\.\.\. I have no reason to follow your request\.  
**Makoto:** The research into tamayori toji could not be going better\. It's nearly every day we come across new data we never could have achieved before\.  
**Makoto:** As of now, only a select few can make use of it\.\.\. But, before long, I'm sure it will be possible for every toji to become tamayori toji\.  
**Ellen:** And you'd sacrifice Akira and Yuuki for that?  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.What are you getting at?  
**Chie:** Inago-san and Toribane-san are having negative side-effects, aren't they?  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.I haven't received any reports about that\.  
**Ellen:** But you're hearing about it now, aren't you?  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** These are all things we've prepared for\.  
**Chie:** Why go this far, Makoto? In the past, you wouldn't have\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Dirtied my hands with these experiments?  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.No matter when you're thinking of me, I haven't changed, Chie-san\.  
**Chie:** Is this because of what happened back then? After that, you\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** I won't deny that it's one of the causes\.  
**Makoto:** I simply\.\.\. don't want there to be any more toji like Miyako-san\.  
**Makoto:** I don't anyone else to experience the things we have\.\.\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Chie:** I understand that feeling\. But still, I'm against you using noro for that\.  
**Makoto:** I wouldn't stop no matter who's against me\.  
**Makoto:** When Inago and Toribane\.\.\. became tamayori toji in my place, I resolved to that\.  
**Ellen:** We're not going to be convincing her\. She seemed very determined to me\.  
**Chie:** Right\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** I know about what happened to Miyako\. You and Makoto were\.\.\.  
**Chie:** We were in the same unit\. Makoto and Miyako especially were paired up\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.So that's why\.  
**Chie:** Yes\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** What do you think we should do, Chie?  
**Chie:** I understand what Makoto is thinking now\. But, even still\.\.\. I can't think tamayori toji are the right answer\.  
**Ellen:** Neither can I\.  
**Ellen:** I'd like it if aradama and humans could coexist, but this isn't what that should look like\.  
**Ellen:** If it can't make everyone happier, there's no point to it\!  
**Chie:** Ellen-san\.\.\.  
**Chie:** --\!? Is that an alarm\!?

## 13: Chie and Makoto (2\)
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\! Where are you\!? Say something\! Chii-nee\!\!  
**Akira:** I was wondering what all the noise was about; it's you guys\.  
**Mihono:** Akira-san\! Please give me back Chii-nee\!  
**Akira:** Give her back? What're you talking about, Mihono? They're free to leave whenever they're done with their inspection\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.This morning, Asakura Mihono was attacked by one of your associates\.  
**Akira:** Huh? What do you mean? I don't know a thing about that\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Maybe you didn't know, Boss, but are you sure that Hitakami-san person didn't order them to?  
**Akira:** Makocchan wouldn't do something like that either\! Only ones who would are\.\.\. So that's how it is\.  
**Kofuki:** What's the deal then? Didn't Chichie get kidnapped?  
**Kiyoka:** I'm not sure, but\.\.\. this all feels weird, doesn't it?  
**???:** Don't let Asakura Mihono get away\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Figures\.  
**Akira:** What the hell are you going off starting on your own\!?  
**???:** Asakura Mihono is the one who came to attack us\.  
**Akira:** Cause you went and baited her, right? Or\.\.\. Not you, but the group of heads backing you\.  
**Hitakami Faction Head Group Toji:** \.\.\.We followed our own judgment\. If you're going to get between us\.\.\. We won't have a choice\.  
**Hitakami Faction Head Group Toji:** You're up\! Bring down Inago-san with them if you have to\!  
**Tamayori Toji:** \.\.\.  
**Akira:** What're you in that for\.\.\.  
**Tamayori Toji:** I was only able to become a proper tamayori toji like this thanks to you, Inago-san\.  
**Akira:** "Proper"?  
**Akira:** Get the fuck out of here\! Nobody besides me and Yuuki can get the noro off of them\!  
**Tamayori Toji:** I'm prepared for whatever comes\. Regardless, I believe this is what's necessary for the future of toji\.  
**Akira:** You goddamn idiots\! Mihono\!  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah\!?  
**Akira:** I'm backing you up\!  
**Akira:** I'm gonna smash their faces in, till they never think of doing something this stupid again\!

## 14: The Scheme's Consequence (1\)
**Tamayori Toji:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Mihono:** Kgh\.\.\.\!  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan, stay behind me\!  
**Mihono:** O-Okay\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.A tamayori toji with their consciousness intact is that much more troublesome than the one we faced before\.  
**Kofuki:** It's not like we can ignore the other ones either; what do we do, Mirja\!?  
**Mirja:** Do not fight the tamayori toji head on\! Move to create an opening\!  
**Yui:** That's easy to say, but, like this\.\.\.\!  
**Hitakami Faction Head Group Toji:** YAAAAAH\!  
**Yui:** Uwah\!?  
**Akira:** Don't you touch Yui, asshole\!  
**Hitakami Faction Head Group Toji:** Urgh\.\.\.  
**Akira:** You alright, Yui\!?  
**Yui:** Th-Thanks a lot, Boss\!  
**Yui:** Or, wait, Boss\! Can't you become a tamayori toji too\!? Wouldn't that make this way easier\!  
**Akira:** No can do\! I haven't got noro on me now\!  
**Mihono:** (Everybody's struggling\.\.\. If I had some way to use Kanayamahime's power without going berserk\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Rrgh\!?  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan\!?  
**Mihono:** But, ghh\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Is she losing control\!? You can't, Mihono\! You've gotta\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** AAAAAAAARRRGGGHHHHHH\!\!  
**Chie:** Everyone\! \.\.\.Mihono-chan\!?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Chie:** No\.\.\. Mihono-chan\! Hey, can you hear me\!?  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.Chie\.  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.We have to stop Mihomiho's from rampaging before we can do anything\.  
**Ellen:** Kaoru told me all she had to do was cut through her utsushi\.\.\.  
**Akira:** That's right\.\.\.  
**Hitakami Faction Head Group Toji:** We did it\! We actually did it\! Now, we can\.\.\.  
**Akira:** You think this is the time for that\!?  
**Hitakami Faction Head Group Toji:** Ugh\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Akira-chan\!  
**Akira:** \.\.\.I'm sorry\. I couldn't stop things from going to shit\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.It's not your fault\.  
**Chie:** Makoto\! Is this what you wanted\!?  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.Right now, we need to take care of Asakura-san\.\.\.  
**Chie:** I don't need you to tell me that\.\.\.\! I'll be the one to bring Mihono-chan back\!

## 15: The Scheme's Consequence (2\)
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\! Please, just go back to normal\.\.\.\!\!  
**Mihono:** Rrgh\!  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Chie:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hitakami Faction Head Group Toji:** Go now; capture Asakura Mihono\!  
**Makoto:** You mustn't let them have Asakura-san\!  
**Kofuki:** Like you have to say it\!  
**Mirja:** Setouchi Chie, take care of Asakura Mihono\! Musumi Kiyoka, Yamashiro Yui, protect Setouchi Chie\!  
**Chie:** I'm on it\! Cover us, you two\!  
**Kiyoka/Yui:** Right\!  
**Akira:** These are\.\.\. Yomi's\!  
**???:** Everyone, this is your chance now\!  
**Mirja:** --\! Run towards the sound of that voice\!\!  
**Friedman:** It looks like we all made it out safe\.  
**Ellen:** You're safe too, Grandpa\!  
**Friedman:** That's because, as soon as the alarm went off, she got in contact with us\.  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** You were here too, Senpai?  
**Suzuka:** I had her come along, should worse come to worst\.  
**Suzuka:** Though\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Suzuka:** The Special Defense Team will be taking custody of Asakura-san\. Is that clear?  
**Other:** A Request  
**Akane:** I'm sorry to call you here on such short notice\.  
**Kanami:** That doesn't matter; is it true Mihono-chan went berserk\!?  
**Akane:** \.\.\.It's the truth\.  
**Hiyori:** Did Kanayamahime wake up?  
**Akane:** \.\.\.Not yet\.  
**Kanami:** What made all this happen\.\.\.  
**Akane:** The heads of the Hitakami faction acted out of control\.  
**Hiyori:** Their faction's infighting now\.\.\.\!? Don't drag Mihono into something so stupid\.\.\.\!  
**Akane:** \.\.\.  
**Akane:** Asakura-san will be placed in confinement at a Ministry of Defense facility\. And, that's where\.\.\. I have a request to make of you\.  
**Kanami/Hiyori:** A request?
