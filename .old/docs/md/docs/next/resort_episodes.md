## [Resort Dress - Chie: Start\]: Choosing Souvenirs
**Chie:** Hmm, what kind of souvenir should I get everyone?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Is that you, Setouchi-san?  
**Chie:** Eh?  
**Chie:** Oh, Hirona-chan\! What a surprise, running into you here\.  
**Chie:** Were you on vacation here too?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.So you're on vacation, Setouchi-san\. I'm jealous\.  
**Hirona:** I'm here on a mission\. Though, we already finished it\.  
**Hirona:** If you're on vacation, does that mean you came here by yourself?  
**Chie:** Mm-mm, I came with Mihono-chan and Mirja\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.So then you're here to get souvenirs for the others left back home?  
**Hirona:** Then, can we pick them out together?  
**Chie:** Eh?  
**Hirona:** I actually came to get souvenirs for the people who've helped me too\.  
**Hirona:** But, picking out souvenirs is very inefficient\.  
**Chie:** Fufu, I know what you mean; there's a lot to decide on\. You want to make the person you're giving it to happy, after all\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Right\.  
**Chie:** Well, how about we choose some together then?  
**Hirona:** I would appreciate itt\.  
**Hirona:** What were you going to buy, Setouchi-san?  
**Chie:** Let's see\.\.\. I had a rough idea I'd get baked sweets\. Everybody will eat those\.  
**Hirona:** Sweets are very efficient like that\.  
**Chie:** Mmhm, sweets are the greatest for gifts\.  
**Chie:** But\.\.\. a part of me also wonders, would that be boring?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.That's true\.  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.I could see this taking a while\. This might not actually save me any time\.\.\.\)  
**Chie:** Aradama\!?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Did they get away? I was sure we suppressed them all though\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Setouchi-san, I'll go take care of this\.  
**Chie:** Wait\! I'll go with you\!  

## [Resort Dress - Chie: End\]: Old People Charmer
**Hirona:** Now they're\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Finished\.  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.  
**Chie:** You did great, Hirona-chan\.  
**Hirona:** The after-service is overr\.  
**Hirona:** Let's go back to the souvenirs\. I feel like just going with sweets\.  
**Chie:** You're right; how about we pick some tasty looking sweets\.  
**Hirona:** Okay\.  
Local Citizen A： Thanks, miss toji\! Here, take these\!

  
**Local Citizen B:** These too, as souvenirs\!  
**Chie:** U-Um\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Thank you very muuuch\.  
**Chie:** I feel bad, taking this much\.\.\.  
Local Citizen A： It's fine, it's fine\!

  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.  
**Hirona:** You're a real old people charmerr\.  
**Chie:** Old people charmer\!? That's the first time anyone's told me that\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** There's nothing wrong with it\. Now we won't have to worry about souvenirs\.  
**Chie:** That's true, but\.\.\. Oh?  
**Chie:** These clothes, Kiyoka-chan would look nice in them\.\.\. And these are for Kofuki-chan\.  
**Chie:** These ones\.\.\. Maybe for Mirja? She doesn't need a souvenir though\.\.\. Oh well, I'll give her them anyway\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.You sure think a lot about other people, Setouchi-san\.  
**Chie:** Eh?  
**Hirona:** Instead of Kitora-san, I think these clothes would look even better on you\.  
**Chie:** You think so?  
**Hirona:** I doo\.  
**Hirona:** Ah, I'll take these sweets here\. Mm, that went efficiently\.  
**Chie:** Honestly, Hirona-chan\.  
**Chie:** Though\.\.\. they do seem just fine as a gift\.  

## [Resort Dress - Mihono: Start\]: It's Not There\!\!
**Mihono:** This'll definitely look good on you, Akira-san\!\!  
**Akira:** Huhh\!? Quit screwin' with me\! Like hell I'd wear that\!\!  
**Mihono:** I'm not screwing with you\! I want you to try on some cute clothes too\!  
**Akira:** How dumb are you\!? It's not gonna look any good\! I'm into rough and ready kinda clothes, okay\!  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka says just cause you like something doesn't mean that's all you look good in\! There could be a bunch of clothes you'd like but won't try just cause you think they won't work\!  
**Akira:** What does that have to do with anything\!?  
**Mihono:** What's wrong with trying\!  
**Mihono:** We're here on vacation, so you should try on some clothes you've never tried before\!  
**Akira:** I only came here cause I had a mission to\!  
**Mihono:** But you already finished with that, right? And you even came shopping with me now\!  
**Akira:** Yeah, but\.\.\. Look, just forget about me and pick your own clothes\! Like here, wouldn't this look good on you\!  
**Mihono:** Ugh\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Nn? Why'd you get all quiet\.\.\. Something wrong?  
**Mihono:** I don't have all that much money\.\.\. Only enough to buy one thing, but I can't pick just one\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** So I'm stuck on this\.  
**Akira:** Don't be\. I know you'd look great in any of these\. Just buy whichever you want\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.You want to get this over with already, don't you?  
**Akira:** Oh yeah I do\.  
**Mihono:** I knew it\! You have that same look Fukki gets when she doesn't care anymore\!  
**kira:** Oh yeah, her, she has that feeling like she just puts on whatever too\.  
**Mihono:** She might seem like that, but even Kiyoka says Fukki's got great fashion sense\!  
**Akira:** What're you looking proud about that for\.  
**Mihono:** Ehehe\.\.\. But still, what do I do\. I want this\.\.\. I want it, but\.\.\.  
**Akira:** (Phew, I somehow got out of that one\.\)  
**Akira:** (Though\.\.\. those clothes from before were pretty cute\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** Wait?  
**Akira:** What now?  
**Mihono:** Huh? Huhhh? My wallet's\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Your wallet? What about it? Didn't have as much cash as you thought?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.It's gone\.  

## [Resort Dress - Mihono: End\]: Don't Make Me Say It\!
**Mihono:** It's gone? It's gone\! It's gone\!? No matter where I look, my wallet's goneeee\!\!  
**Akira:** Huhh\!? You had it at lunch, didn't you\!?  
**Mihono:** But now I can't find it anywhereee\.\.\. Arghh, where could I have dropped it\.\.\.  
**Akira:** No point in standing around asking that here\.  
**Mihono:** But\.\.\.  
**Akira:** I'm gonna go check the police box, you go check the way we came\.  
**Akira:** We'll meet up later\.  
**Mihono:** O-Okay\! Thanks\!  
**Akira:** Alright, before I hit up the police box\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** It wasn't where we ate lunch either; where'd I even drop it\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Mihono\!  
**Mihono:** Akira-san\! Was it at the\.\.\.  
**Akira:** They didn't have it\. What about you?  
**Mihono:** I couldn't find it here either\.\.\. I even went to all the places we stopped by\.\.\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Oh\.  
**Mihono:** Where did you go after the police box, Akira-san\.\.\.?  
**Akira:** I went to buy this, then I went looking for your wallet too\.  
**Mihono:** This? \.\.\.Ah, that's one of the outfits I wasn't sure if I should buy\.\.\.  
**Akira:** I picked this out of all of them\. Not gonna complain about it, are ya?  
**Mihono:** But why\.\.\.?  
**Akira:** It's bad enough you lost your wallet, not getting to buy what you wanted's even worse\. So here, cheer up\.  
**Mihono:** Thanks a lot\.\.\. I feel a little better now\. But\.\.\. we still haven't found my wallet, so I feel kinda mixed up\. Ehehe\.  
**Akira:** Well sure\. Let's trace our steps again; we'll go together this time\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Nn? Hirona? Hey, what're you calling for?  
**Hirona:** Akira-san, you're with Asakura-san today, aren't you?  
**Akira:** Mihono? Yeah, she's here, why?  
**Hirona:** I tried calling her over and over, but she won't answer\. I guess she's panicking since she lost her wallett\.  
**Akira:** Yeah, probably\.\.\. Why do you know about that?  
**Hirona:** Actually, I picked up Asakura-san's wallet\. I'll bring it to you right awayy\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Sure, that'll be great\.  
**Akira:** Oi, Mihono\. Hirona found your wallet\. Says she'll bring it right here\.  
**Mihono:** Hirona did\!? Thank goodness\.\.\. Ah, when I get my wallet, I'll pay you back for\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Don't need it\.  
**Mihono:** Eh, but\.\.\.  
**Akira:** I went and got you a present, so don't go saying something dumb like that\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Alright\!\! Thanks a lot\!\!  

## [Resort Dress - Mirja: Start\]: Scouted
**Mirja:** We were lucky we found that shop earlier\.  
**Mirja:** The whipped creme they had for dessert was especially well made\.  
**Chie:** It was; I thought they were a bit expensive just for lunch, but I can understand why now\.  
**Mirja:** Yes\. Before our vacation is over, I'd like to bring Asakura Mihono back there\.  
**Chie:** Fufu, we should\.  
**Chie:** Do you think Mihono-chan's finished having lunch with Inago-san by now?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Oh, she's sent us a message\.  
**Chie:** Ah, she did\. Looks like she went with Inago-san to a family restaurant\.  
**Chie:** Maybe we should have uploaded pictures of our food too?  
**Mirja:** I don't think we should\. I can already imagine how annoying Yamashiro Yui would be, after missions kept her from coming along\.  
**Chie:** You know Mirja, I've been thinking this for a while, but don't you think you're too hard on Yui-chan sometimes?  
**Mirja:** Am I?  
**Mirja:** Maybe that's in large part due to her being my direct kouhai at Ayanokouji Martial Arts Academy\.  
**???:** Excuse me, do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about this\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Hm? You're a magazine reporter? Did you need something from us?  
**Magazine Reporter:** Do you have any interest in becoming a model?  
**Mirja:** A model\.\.\.?  
**Magazine Reporter:** Ahh, you don't have to look so suspicious\! We're a small-time local magazine\!  
**Magazine Reporter:** I'll come right out and say it, I want you to be a model for us\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.  
**Chie:** Don't give them that look, Mirja\. Let's hear them out first\.  
**Magazine Reporter:** Thank you very much\.  
**Magazine Reporter:** The girl I'd asked to model for us suddenly couldn't make it, so I've been looking for a substitute\.  
**Mirja:** But, why me?  
**Magazine Reporter:** You're exactly the type of model I had in mind\!  
**Chie:** So they say\. It looks like they're in a pinch, so why not help them out?  
**Mirja:** Still\.\.\.  
**Chie:** I'm sure it'll be a nice experience for you\.  
**Mirja:** Acting as if it's someone else's problem\.\.\. Fine then\. I'll take your offer\.  

## [Resort Dress - Mirja: End\]: Model Debut\!
**Mihono:** I can't wait, Chii-nee\!  
**Chie:** I know how you feel, Mihono-chan\.  
**Mihono:** Did you already see what Mirja-san's wearing, Chii-nee? What'd it look like? She must have looked really good, right?  
**Chie:** No, I haven't gotten to see yet\. That's why I'm excited too\.  
**Mirja:** I'm glad to hear that, but it's not all that different from what I typically wear\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.  
**Mirja:** What's wrong?  
**Mihono:** Mirja-san, you look so super pretty, all the words left my mouth\.\.\.\!  
**Chie:** I know, she really does\.\.\. I'm surprised\.  
**Mirja:** Do I really?  
**Mirja:** I didn't think I looked that different from usual\.\.\. Ahh, it must be because of the makeup\.  
**Mihono:** But she's still the same old Mirja-san inside; the gap's making my brain hurt\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Mihono-chan\!? Mirja, you have to help Mihono-chan; start talking more like how you're dressed\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Stop getting so worked up over this, you two\.  
**Mihono/Chie:** Okaaay\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Huh?  
**Yui:** What am I doing here instead of there? I don't get it\. Huh?  
**Yui:** Why is this happening; isn't that like an event made for me?  
**Yui:** Huhh?  
**Mihono:** Yui's making this really awkward\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.That must have been so nice\. I wish I could have been there to watch her model too\.  
**Mihono:** Even Kiyoka's doing it\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Damnit\.\.\.  
**Yui:** What's wrong with me; why didn't I skip my missions to be there\.\.\.\!?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Why are you crying over this?  
**Yui:** WHY WOULDN'T I BE CRYINGGGGGGGGGG\!\!  
**Chie:** Now now\.  
**Chie:** They said they would send us copies once the magazine is finished, so can you wait until then?  
**Yui:** They'll what\.\.\.\!? I still have something to live for\!  
**Kiyoka:** Mirja-san, if you do work as a model again, please take me along next time\!  
**Yui:** You have to bring me too\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.I see I should have never taken the modeling job in the first place\.  
**Kiyoka/Yui:** MIRJA-SAN\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Sigh\. I'll consider it\.
