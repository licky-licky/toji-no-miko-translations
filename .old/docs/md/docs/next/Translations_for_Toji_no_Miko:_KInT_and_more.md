If you're here for game translations, above are links to a youtube playlist subbing everything, and a better formatted site than pastebin to read the raw text\. It also links out to individual youtube videos\. I highly recommend watching those, especially in the case of the fully voiced main story\.

  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
First off, a visual overview of Toji no Miko as a series (as of June 2020\) to give you an idea of how everything fits into place\.

"On a certain day, in August 2017, Asahina Hokuto, third year middle school student of the Heijou Institute, and Inami Suu, first year middle school student of Renpu Girls' School, land at Naha Airport\. They are here to participate in an operational test of the newly developed Storm Armor, produced through the collaborative efforts of both the Sword Administration Bureau and United States military\. On that same day, another toji arrives in Okinawa: Tsubakuro Yume, sixth year elementary school student of Ayanokouji Martial Arts School\. The girls have no knowledge of and share no connection with each other\. For now\. This is a record of the hidden conflict these girls encounter, caught in a scheme involving the Storm Armor, as Hokuto, Suu, and Yume, as well as the elite guard and Mokusa, cross swords\. This story, taking place one year before the events of the anime, is Toji no Miko's first novelization\!"

**Now for the real reason you're here, translations for the the saga of the coolest toji, "Toji no Miko:** Kizamishi Issen no Tomoshibi\."   
The main story is fully voiced, though events and character episodes typically aren't\. Ideally, you watched the anime beforehand, and while the game covers a similar timeline up to a point, it's worth reading all the way through for the new perspectives and changed events\.

  
**[-----Part 1:** Formation  
Trusting in her friend, the meeting waiting as she gives chase is--

  
A "promise" is born\. A story begins\.
