## 1: The Smell of Trouble on a Snowy Mountain Mission\.\.\.
**Mirja:** Shichinosato Kofuki, what are you waiting for\! That aradama is escaping; get after it at once\!  
**Kofuki:** I know already\! I'm trying, but\.\.\. I can't get anywhere with my feet getting stuck in this goddamn snow\.  
**Tsugumi:** Aradama are capable of the same quick movements on both snow and even terrain\. I see, this will be useful data\.  
**Mirja:** Ban Tsugumi, record data later\! And Asakura Mihono, Setouchi Chie\! What's the matter? You're reacting too slowly\!  
**Mihono:** Sorry, I can't move so great, with how cold it is here\.\.\.  
**Chie:** The same goes for me\.\.\. You seem fine though, Kitora-san\. Why is that?  
**Mirja:** With the Scandanavian blood in my veins, cold of this degree is nothing unusual\.  
**Mirja:** Musumi Kiyoka\! There's an aradama directly ahead of you\!  
**Kiyoka:** Okay\! Gh\.\.\. Sorry\. My hands are too numb for me to get a good grip\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** In that case, Shichinosato Kofuki\! \.\.\.Doesn't seem to be up to the task either\.  
**Kofuki:** Fuck\! If it weren't for all this snow, I'd get to enjoy myself with all these aradama-chan\!  
**Tsugumi:** An empty stomach and lack of calcium must be making you grumpy\. I have something sweet for you after we're done here, Shichinosato-san\.  
**Kofuki:** I'm not eating anything until you tell me what you put in it\!  
**Tsugumi:** Fufu, that's a secret though\. I'm sure the rest of you are like me and feel your body temperature and morale quickly dropping\. In which case, this is the perfect chance to test these emergency rations\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Though, I take that back\. It seems one of you is doing fine\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Kiyoka-chan, if you're cold, then I'll warm you right up\! Here, hop into my arms\!  
**Kiyoka:** I'm cold, but\.\.\. I'll take care of myself\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Ehh, don't be shy\! Come on\! Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Mirja:** At any rate, it seems the only ones among us able to move normally are myself and Yamashiro Yui\. Yamashiro Yui, we'll have to manage this together\.  
**Yui:** Okaaay\! Ah, I'll try super hard on this mission, so when we're done, can we all stop by the hot spring\!?  
**Mirja:** If I were to hypothetically agree to that, how much would "super hard" be?  
**Yui:** I'll go at it 5 times harder than I usually do\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.In that case, I'll consider it\.  
**Yui:** Hooray-\! If I get to see everyone bathing in the open under the snow, I'll try super duper hard\!  
**Yui:** DORYAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Tsugumi:** All those aradama, taken out in seconds by one person\.\.\. If only I could research some mechanism to reliably convert those dark thoughts to fighting energy\.  
**Mirja:** Our mission is complete\. Then, before you're all frozen in place, let's head down the mountain\. Please follow after me\.  
**Mihono:** Ughhh, the snow turned into a blizzard\.  
**Chie:** I can't see in front of us thanks to it\.\.\. Mihono-chan, Kiyoka-chan, take my hands so we don't lose each other\.  
**Kiyoka:** Thank you\. But what should we do? We're stuck here with all this snow\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Please remain calm\. I will guide you all out of here, so do your best not to fall behind\.  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san, are you feeling okay? Mirja-san has already moved quite far ahead\.  
**Kofuki:** She'll be fine on her own\. I could do that too, if it weren't snowing\.\.\. Shit\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** You're awfully cranky today\.\.\. At times like this, what would be best to cheer you up\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Kofuki-san, the cold is annoying you, right? Then don't worry; at the bottom of the mountain is a hot spring we can get all heated up in together\!  
**Kofuki:** I don't wanna\!  
**Yui:** Ehh, why not? A hot spring'll get your heart and body feeling all warm and fluffy\! It'll pull you out of that bad mood in a second\~\.  
**Tsugumi:** You're wrong, Yamashiro-san\. What Shichinosato-san is sulking about is that she didn't get to play enough\.  
**Kofuki:** "Didn't get to play enough", what am I, a little kid\!?  
**Mihono:** AH-\!  
**Chie:** What is it, Mihono-chan?  
**Mihono:** J-Just now\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** That was you shouting, wasn't it, Asakura Mihono? What happened?  
**Mihono:** Just now, I saw a yeti over there in the woods\!  

## 2: Form Up\! Yeti Investigation Team
**Tsugumi:** A yeti\.\.\.? Over there in the woods you said, Asakura-san\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** As if there's something like that out here\! You suck at making jokes, Mihocchi\.  
**Mirja:** I have to agree\. Creatures like yeti don't actually exist\.  
**Mihono:** But I know I saw it for sure\!  
**Kiyoka:** If it really is out there, that's scary\.\.\. What if it tries to eat us\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Don't be afraid, Kiyoka-chan\. If something like that happens, I'll protect you\. And you never know, it could be a friendly yeti who's come to help us\.  
**Yui:** A friendly yeti? I hope it's a yuki onna instead then\. They're meant to be hot\.  
**Tsugumi:** It must have been a fair distance away, so I doubt she was able to tell its sex\. The weather has improved, so why don't we go looking for this yeti?  
**Kofuki:** Count me out\. I'm not walking around through all this snow looking for something that's not even an aradama-chan\.  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san, we have to capture this yeti\. If it turns out to be some new kind of aradama that doesn't register on our spectrum finders\.\.\. That could be a very useful sample\.  
**Kofuki:** A new kind of aradama-chan\!? You shouldn't said that sooner\! We've got plenty of time before the train back comes, right? Let's go hunting\!  
**Kiyoka:** Suddenly Kofuki-san's more excited than anyone\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** It's true that's a possibility\. The blizzard has ended and it's become warmer, so why don't we search the area?  
**Mihono:** I'm all for it\!  
**Kofuki:** Come on, come on, outta the way-\! I'm gonna be the first one to meet this new aradama-chan\! You guys just try to keep up\!  
**Mirja:** She's very determined, that Shichinosato Kofuki\. Now then, Asakura Mihono? Can you name any identifying features of the yeti you saw?  
**Mihono:** Umm\.\.\. It was really big, like I think it was over two meters tall\. And it had all this messy white fur\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Two meters tall\.\.\. By the way, this messy fur it had, could you be more specific about it?  
**Mihono:** Uhh\.\.\. I know its head was all covered in fur, like PSHAAA, waving around all over\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Oh yeah, oh yeah\! Its eyes were seriously glowing too\! It was like someone glaring, but way too intense for a person\! It was so scary\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** (\.\.\.I see, so that's what happened\. Well, I won't spoil their fun\.\)  
**Tsugumi:** (Besides, if worst comes to worst, I have these emergency rations\. We should be able to avoid disaster\.\.\.\)  
**Mirja:** The yeti\.\.\. In some countries, it's also known as "bigfoot"\. It's defined as\.\.\. Living deep in the mountains, far from human civilization, its body covered in thick fur, bipedal and stands upright\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** It's true that this unidentified animal you saw matches the definition on several points\.  
**Kofuki:** Was it really over this way, Mihocchi?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\. I saw it deep in the woods, so it should be over there\.  
**Kiyoka:** Is it me, or is the sky getting darker?  
**Chie:** It is\. They say the weather up on mountains is fickle, but\.\.\. Oh no, the snow's coming down again\.  
**Mihono:** We've been walking pretty far\. Will we be able to find our way back?  
**Yui:** I've got that covered\! I left pebbles marking the way we came so we couldn't get lost, see\.\.\. Wait, huh?  
**Tsugumi:** Now we can't see them due to the blizzard\.  
**Mirja:** This is a problem\. Now we have no way of knowing the way back, do we?  
**Kiyoka:** Then, does that mean\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** We're stranded up here\!?  

## 3: Stranded?
**Tsugumi:** The blizzard's grown even stronger than before, hasn't it? At this rate we might actually be stranded up here\.  
**Kiyoka:** What's going to happen to us\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** This is my fault\. It's all because I said something I shouldn't have\.  
**Kofuki:** No point in crying about it\. Besides, I was the one who wanted to go hunting for that aradama-chan\.  
**Tsugumi:** I'm also to blame\. I shouldn't have provoked Shichinosato-san\. I'm sorry\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** Kitora-san, how do they resolve situations like this when they happen in Scandinavia?  
**Mirja:** Unfortunately, I've never experienced being stranded in Scandanavia, so I have no practical knowledge that would help\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** But it would be a good idea to move as little as necessary during the blizzard to preserve your stamina\. I will search for a safe route out, so the rest of you should remain waiting here without wandering\.  
**Mihono:** She's gone\. Will Mirja-san be okay by herself\.\.\.?  
**Chie:** We should just do as she told us and wait here\.  
**Yui:** Sorry\.\.\. I'm feeling really hungry from all the exercise before\.  
**Tsugumi:** That reminds me\. I made emergency rations just in case something like this happened\. Would you all like some?  
**Kiyoka:** Eh\.\.\. You made them, Tsugumi-san\.\.\.?  
**Mihono:** Which means\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Tsugumi-san's home cooking\!? Nothing would make me happier up on this mountain than eating a girl's home cooking\~\! Don't mind if I do\~\! Chew chew\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Oi, oi, do you have any idea what she put in those things\!? Is it safe for her to dig in like that\!?  
**Yui:** BWHA\.\.\. Wh-What is this? I've never tasted anything like it? What's in it, anyway\!?  
**Tsugumi:** A balanced assortment of meat and fish proteins, blended with various fruits, vegetables, and supplements, all processed for long term storage\.  
**Tsugumi:** As its purpose was to aid in survival in snowy mountain conditions, I paid no attention to the taste\. Is there a problem with it?  
**Yui:** I mean, it does taste like it'd be pretty nutritious, but my mouth is still all tingling and numb and mushy\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** What kinda flavor is that\! No matter what, there's nooo way I'm eating that crappy food of yours\!  
**Tsugumi:** Is the taste that bad? Chew chew\.\.\. I think this is an acceptable level for food though\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Huh? I started feeling all funny\. Like I'm getting all warmed up and energized\!  
**Mihono:** Really\!?  
**Yui:** Yeah\! I'm feeling way more lively now, like I'm bursting with strength-\!  
**Chie:** Could those rations actually be effective?  
**Kiyoka:** In that case, it might better if we tried to ignore the taste and ate them anyway\.  
**Kofuki:** No way\! I'm not eating those\.\.\. Achoo\! Brrr\. Dammit, is there anything we can do about this cold already?  
**Yui:** If that's all you want, then I'll warm you right up with my burning hot body, Kofuki-san\!  
**Kofuki:** Quit grabbing at me\.  
**Yui:** Ehh, but you let Tsugumi-san get close, so what's the difference?  
**Tsugumi:** Shichinosato-san is fundamentally a catlike person\. If you chase her she'll hiss at you, which is why it's best to wait for her to come to you\.  
**Yui:** Really\! That's useful information\! But I'm no good at waiting, you know\~\.  
**Yui:** Aghh, that's it\~\! I can't take any more of this doing nothing waiting around for the blizzard to stop\! Everyone, the time has come to use our last resort\!  
**Tsugumi:** A last resort in enduring the blizzard?  
**Yui:** That's right, we'll all get naked and hug each other for warmth\!  
**Tsugumi:** I see, through direct physical contact and keeping the amount of skin exposed to open air at a minimum, such a method would allow us to preserve our body temperature\.  
**Tsugumi:** It's a common technique brought up in romantic movies and the like\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** If we went along with that, there wouldn't be any romance to it though\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** You're supposed to do that in a shack or something, not out in the middle of the mountain\!  
**Yui:** The circumstances are so great that we can't even find one of those\! We have to do this, to save all your lives\.\.\. Pant pant\.\.\. Come on\! I'll start with Tsugumi-san-\!  
**Tsugumi:** Wh-Why are you starting with me\!?  
**Yui:** As the new member, don't you think this is the fastest way to deepen our friendship?  
**Yui:** There's no time to waste; please take your clothes off\! Or are you the type who likes having them taken off? Pant pant pant\.\.\.  

## 4: Yeti Discovery
**Yui:** Come on, Tsugumi-san\! If you won't take those clothes off, I'll get them off for you\~\!  
**Tsugumi:** Th-That's going a little too far\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** AHH-\! Yeti-\!  
**Kofuki:** For real\!? Where?  
**Mihono:** There\! Look, over behind that tree\!  
**Chie:** It's hard to see through the blizzard\.\.\. But I saw something white moving around just now\!  
**Kiyoka:** I think I see glowing eyes too\.\.\. Eh\.\.\. What should we do? It keeps coming closer to us\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Ohhh, so it finally showed up\! The new aradama-chan\!  
**Yui:** I won't let it get away with interrupting my lovey dovey time with Tsugumi-san-\!  
**Mihono:** Wah, while we were talking, it keeps getting closer\.\.\.\!  
**Kiyoka:** Somebody, help us-\!  
**Mihono/Kiyoka/Chie:** KYAAA-\!\!  
**Tsugumi:** (As I thought, "fear makes fools of us all"\.\)  
**Mirja:** Did something happen? You were making an awful lot of noise\. I found a way back down, so I came to show you all\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Say, Mihono-chan, was the yeti you saw\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I-I'm sorry\.\.\. I mean, she's white all over\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Ehh? What do you mean? What happened to the yeti?  
**Kiyoka:** Hono-chan was seeing things\.\.\. And thought Mirja-san was a yeti\.  
**Mirja:** Asakura Mihono\! Which means, the first sighting as well\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Sorry, I think it was because you were walking out ahead of us\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Oi oi, Mihocchi\! There's a limit to crying wolf, you know\!  
**Tsugumi:** Kitora-san did look like the real thing, though\.  
**Kofuki:** Oi, you\.\.\. Don't tell me you knew from the start?  
**Tsugumi:** I thought I'd be able to collect a fair amount of practical data by letting the misunderstanding go on\.  
**Kofuki:** This is the problem with you\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** I came up with some good ideas for improving my emergency rations, so assist me in a few trials once we get back to the lab, okay?  
**Mirja:** Sigh\.\.\. A two meter tall giant covered in shaggy hair\.\.\.?  
**Mirja:** So that's how I appear in Asakura Mihono's eyes\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** I'm really sorry, Mirja-san\! I've never thought that about you normally\.\.\.\!  
**Mirja:** That innocent concern of yours doesn't make this any better\. A two meter tall hairy giant\.\.\.  
**Chie:** A-Anyway, now that we know the way down the mountain, we should get going while the weather's cleared up\.  
**Yui:** That's right\! And when we get down the mountain, hot spring\~ hot spring\~\.  
**Mirja:** I learned when I was searching for our route that this area of the mountain is actually directly behind a ski resort\. It seems to be a popular location for snowboarding\.  
**Kiyoka:** Snowboarding\! That sounds fun\.  
**Tsugumi:** In that case, why don't we try some snowboarding before heading home\! Allow me to observe just how much stamina you all have left after being stranded in a blizzard\.  
**Kofuki:** Huh\!? Why should we wear ourselves out for you\!?  
**Tsugumi:** This is valuable data\!  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Sigh\. Well, since it sounds like I don't get a say in it, I'll tag along\.  
**Mihono:** Awesome-\! Let's all go snowboarding before we leave\!  
**Chie/Kiyoka:** Lets\!  
**Yui:** Uuu, but the hot spring\.\.\.  

## 5: The Origami Family Joins In
**Tsugumi:** Everyone, the entrance is this way\. There really was a ski resort up here after all\.  
**Kofuki:** Snowboarding's whatever, but I guess I'll give it a shot before we head back\.  
**Tsugumi:** You say that, but you're a little excited for this, aren't you\.  
**Kofuki:** Wha\.\.\. As if\!  
**Maki:** You all seem to have carried out your mission successfully\. Good work\.  
**Kofuki:** Huh\!? What's Maki-senpai doing here?  
**Maki:** Good to see you too\.\.\. After reviewing your combat data, Yukari-sama decided to institute training for toji on further missions in snowy conditions\.  
**Maki:** And so, bringing some available toji up here, we rented this ski resort as a space for snowy combat training exercises\.  
**Yume:** Thaaaat's how it is\! It's training where a whole bunch of toji go around fighting each other in the snow\~\!  
**Yume:** So ready or not, here I come\~\!  
**Kofuki:** Oi oi oi oi\!\!  
**Maki:** Hey, hold it, Yume\. These girls just got back from a mission, so they must be exhausted, aren't they?  
**Kofuki:** Yeah, we're totally beat\. We want to get out of here already, so you mind if we skip this?  
**Tsugumi:** But we were all going to go snowboarding before we left\.  
**Kofuki:** Oi-\! Just shut up about that\!  
**Maki:** Oh, so you still had the energy to fool around\. Then I'll have to ask you to join this training\. You can share with the others what you learned fighting in the snow\.  
**Yume:** I like it, I like it\! With you onee-sans around, this'll get more fun\~\. Let's fight already\!  
**Kofuki:** You know\.\.\. Would it kill you to read the mood a little\.\.\.?  
**Tsugumi:** Now now, Shichinosato-san, there's nothing to worry about\. I thought something like this might happen and prepared these\.  
**Kofuki:** Huh? What's that? I already don't like where this is going\.  
**Tsugumi:** Fufu\. These are my prized "special emergency rations", for warming your frozen body and restoring your energy before you know it\.  
**Kofuki:** Those're gonna taste like garbage again, aren't they\!  
**Kofuki:** But I guess they do work pretty good\.\.\. Dammit, I don't think I've got a choice this time\.\.\.  
**Tsugumi:** About these "special emergency rations", I'll only offer them to anyone who beats me in a fight\. If you want one, then go right ahead and challenge me\.  
**Kofuki:** Oi, quit screwing around\. Just hand 'em out\!  
**Tsugumi:** But I want more data on all of you fighting in the snow\.  
**Tsugumi:** I have plenty to offer to anyone willing to help me out\.  
**Kofuki:** Whatever\! I get it, so\.\.\. I'll play along\.  
**Maki:** You seem more willing now, at least\.  
**Maki:** I should mention that Yukari-sama herself will also be overseeing this training\. If you end up facing off against her, do your best not to disappoint\.  
**Maki:** With that out of the way, let's start the practice battles\.
