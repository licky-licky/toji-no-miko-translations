## 1: The Operation Commences
**Mirja:** There it is; the Origami estate\.  
**Yui:** Nice timing\! Mokusa seems like they're about to start making their move too\. See, look at my phone\.  
**Reporter:** Hang on, it looks like something's happening\! Someone came out onto the deck of the submarine\! It appears to be a woman\.  
**Akane:** \.\.\.Everyone\. My name is Origami Akane\. Please, listen to what I have to say\.  
**Mihono:** So that's Origami Akane-sama\.\.\.  
**Akane:** Right now, the country is facing an immense crisis\. Like the one 20 years ago, no, a worse disaster is about to occur\.  
**Akane:** The cause of that disaster 20 years ago\.\.\. That great aradama has once again returned\.  
**Akane:** You toji felt it, didn't you? That strange phenomenon earlier\.  
**Yui:** Does she mean that sort of out-of-body experience from before?  
**Akane:** Please, everyone, lend me your strength\!  
**Newscaster:** What was that? There's something else moving\. Is that the hatches on the submarine? They seem to be opening--  
**Newscaster:** M-Missiles\!? No, those were containers\.\.\. Weren't they?  
**Akane:** This is not an attack\. What we launched just now is our hope\.  
**Kiyoka:** Inside those containers\.\.\. Maybe\.\.\. It's Mokusa's toji\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** We're out of time\. I'll briefly go over the details of the operation\.  
**Mirja:** As we discussed earlier, our objective is to cause disorder\. To throw the enemy into confusion, and draw their attention even if we are outnumbered\.  
**Mirja:** The grounds cover an extensive area, so thinking efficiently, we should split into two teams\. Setouchi Chie, Shichinosato Kofuki, and Asakura Mihono will form the A team\. The rest of us will form the B team\.  
**Yui:** Then I'm on B team\. Kiyoka-chan, let's look after each other\! If you get scared, go ahead and hug me tight whenever you feel like it\! Bring it on, don't hold back\! No really, I'm serious\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ahaha\.\.\. Thanks\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** From this moment forward, each team will operate by their own judgment\. Even so, do not lose track and overextend yourselves\.  
**Mirja:** Only if each of each of you safely returns will we be able to call this our first successful operation\.  
**Chie:** That's right\. After this is over, why don't we all eat crepes together again?  
**Mihono:** I'm all for it\~\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** I'll do my best\.\.\. For the crepes\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Now, begin the operation\.  
At the same time, in the Origami family Operations Control Room--

  
**Maki:** What's going on?  
**Operator:** \.\.\.We've picked up an unidentified flying unit\. They're\.\.\. Storm armor containers\!  
**Suzuka:** Where are they landing\!?  
**Operator:** Here\! They're flying right here\!  
**Maki:** What\!\! Is this what's left of Mokusa?  
**Toji:** Take cover\! Take cover\!  

## 2: Distraction Operation (1\)
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** What's wrong, Kanami?  
**Kanami:** I was just thinking, we're back where we all first met\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.That's true\. Right, I never thought I'd be able to come back\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.It's too soon to get caught up in emotion\.  
**Ellen:** Saaya's right\. Even with the spare battery, the storm armor's running time is only 30 minutes\. We have to defeat the great aradama in that timeframe\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Time isn't on our side here\.  
**Ellen:** Yes\. Because of that, please turn off your spectrum finders\. They'll only get in the way of finding the great aradama\.  
**Ellen:** If we leave them as is, they could broadcast our location to the enemy\.  
**Kaoru:** If the Origami family wasn't using dirty tricks, we could bring the fight to the great aradama straight away\.  
**Nene:** Nene\.\.\.\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.It's that way, Nene?  
**Sayaka:** That way is\.\.\. The shrine?  
**Kanami:** Then the great aradama has to be\.\.\.  
**???:** Found\~ youuu\.  
**Everyone:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\!?  
**Yume:** --I made up my mind\. I'm gonna have you play with me, Chidori onee-san\!  
**Kanami:** \!\!  
**Kanami:** Kh\.\.\.\!  
**Yume:** Ahahahaha\!  
At the same time, with Asakura Mihono's A team--

  
**Mihono:** There was a huge boom from over there\. That made me jump\!  
**Chie:** They must have gotten started\. Then we have to cause as much of a commotion as we can and draw the guard's attention to us\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! We have to go on a rampage to cover for Kanami and them\!  
**Toji:** Who's there; what are you doing here\!?  

## 3: Distraction Operation (2\)
**Toji:** Guh\.\.\.\!\!  
**Kofuki:** Mannn, this is a pain in the ass\.  
**Mihono:** What's wrong? Normally you look all smug after you go wild, but you seem pretty down now?  
**Kofuki:** I'm not some kind of battle maniac, you know\. I just like messing around with aradama-chan\. There's nothing fun about fighting other people\.  
**Kofuki:** Plus it's annoying having to worry about not killing them\. Can't I just cut 'em up?  
**Chie:** Don't\. We can't afford to risk murdering anyone\.  
**Kofuki:** I know already\. Mann, this is such a pain\.  
**Chie:** Come on, cheer up and let's draw off some more guards\.  
**Mihono:** I'll give it my best shot, yeah--\!  
**Kofuki:** Yeah-, you can do it, you can do it\.  
**Chie:** You too, Kofuki-chan\. I know you can do anything if you try, so keep at it\.  
**Kofuki:** Just quit being so pushy already\.\.\. Sigh\~, I don't feel like it, but I'll do what I can I guess\.  

## 4: Girl Hunt (1\)
At the same time, with Kitora Mirja's B team\.

  
**Toji A:** Over there\! The rebels are over there\! Don't allow them to riot any further in Yukari-sama's headquarters\!\!  
**Mirja:** A team must have begun to act\. We should begin our work as well\.  
**Kiyoka:** O-Okay\.\.\. (deep breath\)\.\.\. (deep breath\)\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Kuhuu\~, Kiyoka-chan's nervous deep breathing's too cyuuute\~\! I just want to take you home and hang you up in my room\!  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui\. It seems you're unaffected by nervousness at least\. I hope I can count on that\.  
**Yui:** I never thought the day would come I'd get relied on by a hottie like Mirja-san, but I'm so glad I was born\~\! This feeling'll last me a lifetime\!  
**Kiyoka:** I wish I could have just a little bit of that mental strength\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Why stop there? You can have everything, Kiyoka-chan; my heart, soul and body could all be yours\~\.  
**Kiyoka:** Ahaha\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** It appears Musumi Kiyoka has overcome some of her nervousness as well\. Then, let's begin our operation\.  
**Toji B:** Where are the rebels\!?  
**Yui:** Oh crap\! Get down, get down\! C'mon, hurry, they'll see us\!  
**Toji A:** What are you doing, they're this way\!  
**Toji B:** I'll be right there\!  
**Yui:** Phew\~, they would have spotted us for sure\.\.\. Go me\!  
**Kiyoka:** H-Huh\.\.\. Uhh\~?  
**Yui:** Hm? What's that weird look for? Don't tell me, you've fallen for me? Aww\~, I'm so embarrassed\~\.  
**Mirja:** Yamashiro Yui, do you not understand the aim of this operation? Our objective is to draw the enemy's attention, so what good will hiding do?  
**Yui:** --Ah, oh yeah\! I just hid on instinct\!  
**Yui:** It's a pretty bad time for my clumsiness to kick in\! But, it's kinda cute too, right?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Ahh\~n\. That icy glare of yours like you're looking at a bug sends shivers up my spine\! Thank you very much\!  
**Kiyoka:** I can't even start to understand why you're thanking her\.\.\.  
**Yui:** 'kay, that's enough repenting\! It's all smooth sailing from here\! I'll get it done more perfect than you can imagine, so leave everything to me\!  
**Mirja:** That's what I'd like to ask of you\. I only hope you don't sail us upriver\.  
**Toji C:** Where's the enemy? I'll make sure anyone who turns on Yukari-sama gets dealt with\!  
**Yui:** Oh, she's a sitting duck\! Now's my chance\!  
**Toji C:** Wh-Who's there\!?  
**Yui:** Who? Just the future love of your life, you cute little kitten you\. I heard you were looking for me though; looking to ask me on a date?  
**Yui:** If that's the case, all I can say is YES\. Come here, let me give you a night you'll never forget\! You know you want it\. Just throw yourself into my arms\!  
**Toji C:** P-Pervert\! Everyone, there's a pervert here\! Get everyone you can together and get them over here as soon as possible\!\!  
**Yui:** I did it, Mirja-san\! Operation successful\!  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.It seems like it\.  

## 5: Girl Hunt (2\)
**Yui:** Awww\~\.\.\. It's too painful, using my okatana on girls like this\. My heart's about to burst\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** However, we're having an effect\. Let's keep this up and head to the next position\.  
**Yui:** Right, I'll join you\! Even if you take me to the ends of the earth, I'll be there\!  
**Kiyoka:** Where does all your energy come from, Yui-chan\.\.\.?  
**Yui:** Eh, you want to know?  
**Kiyoka:** N-No\.\.\. For some reason I'm scared to find out\.\.\. So I'll pass\.\.\.  
**Yui:** There's nothing to be afraid of\~, it won't even hurt\~\. Too bad\!  

## 6: An Overwhelming Impulse (1\)
**Yume:** Chidori onee-san\. You've gotta be stronger than anybody else\. So if I beat you, onee-san, I'll\.\.\.\!\!  
**Kanami:** (Such amazing drive\.\.\.\! This girl, how is she\.\.\. But\.\.\. This is fun\!\)  
**Yume:** Haah-\!  
**Kanami:** Amazing\.\.\.\! That's Ten'nen Rishin-Ryu at its peak\! But, I won't be beat\!  
**Yume:** Pant, pant, pant\.\.\.\! Not\.\.\. Yet\.\.\. Onee-san\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** (Until what\.\.\.? Is she in a hurry or something\.\.\.?\)  
**Yume:** Pant, pant\.\.\. This is fun\.\.\. Right\.\.\.?  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Yeah\.  
**Yume:** (inhale\)\.\.\. (exhale\)\.\.\. Here I come, Onee-san\! HAAAAAAAH-\!  
**Kanami:** HAAAAAAHH-\!  
**Ellen:** \.\.\.And, right there\! I'm cutting in\!  
**Kaoru:** Dynamic\.  
**Yume:** Get out of my\.\.\.\!  
**Kaoru:** Now for some\.\.\. Hachimanriki\.  
**Ellen:** Home ruuuuun\! Kanamin's out of the park\! Special delivery to Hiyoyon\!  
**Kanami:** Hyaaaaaa\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Fufufu, too bad for you\. Kanamin went flying over Hiyoyon's way\.  
**Yume:** I almost had her\.\.\. Why'd you go and butt in\!  
**Kaoru:** Just seeing that look on your face makes it worth it\.  
**Ellen:** We owe you quite a lot for all our friends in Mokusa you hurt\!  
**Yume:** And so what? It's their fault for being so weak, wasn't it\!  
**Yume:** I know too\. That the only reason they're leaving you behind here is because you're weak\.  
**Yume:** And that means, unlike that Chidori onee-san, without both of you together you wouldn't be able to stop me, right?  
**Kaoru:** That's about right\. Thought I hate to admit it\.  
**Ellen:** It's a good thing we have someone in command who can calmly assess the situation and make the best decisions\.  
**Kaoru:** On top of that, it's not just the two of us\. Nene\.  
**Nene:** Nene-ne-\!  
**Kaoru:** It's the two of us and one pet\.  
**Yume:** Like I said, so what? Whatever, I'll go after her right as soon as I'm done with you\! I don't\.\.\. Have time for this\!  
At the same time, with Asakura Mihono's A team--

  
**Kofuki:** That's most of the guards around here dealt with\. What next?  
**Chie:** Okay, then let's change posi--  
**Toji:** The rebels\! The rebels are over here\!  
**Kofuki:** Tch\.\.\. They're still coming after us?  

## 7: An Overwhelming Impulse (2\)
**Kofuki:** That's all of them for sure this time, right? So, where to now?  
**Mihono:** Kanami and the others are going after the great aradama, aren't they?  
**Kofuki:** Well duh\. That's why we're doing this raid in the first place\.  
**Mihono:** Then I want to go where the great aradama is too\!  
**Chie:** But there's nothing we can do to help there\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** You can't say that if we haven't gone and tried\!  
**Mihono:** We might not be able to do anything, but there could also be something we can do\. That chance makes it worth going\.  
**Mihono:** This huge reaction we're picking up definitely isn't normal\.\.\. I can't just stay here and leave everything to Kanami\. So\.\.\. I'm going\!  
**Chie:** I understand\.\.\. Then, let's go\. I don't want you going by yourself, Mihono-chan\.  
**Kofuki:** I'm down for it too\. I've been interested in seeing what a great aradama's like\.  
**Kofuki:** Besides, we can't leave Mihocchi running off alone\. Someone's gotta babysit her\.  
**Mihono:** Ehh\~ I don't want to hear that from you of all people, Fukki\.  
**Kofuki:** What was that\~?  
**Mihono:** Ahaha\.  

## 8: B Team (1\)
**Mai:** Aradama\.\.\.\!? And there's so many of them\!  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan, these aradama\.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** Mm\. The one behind them-- The third seat of the elite guard\.\.\. Satsuki Yomi\!  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Now go\.\.\. My aradama\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** There\! Hyaah-\!\!  
**Sayaka:** \!\!  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.More\.\.\. More\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** We keep cutting and cutting and they keep coming; there's no end to this\. We're only wasting our energy here\.\.\.\!  
**Mai:** Don't worry\. Dash on through, forward and to the right\!  
**Kanami:** Got it\!  
**Hiyori:** Good, we made it past\!  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.I won't let you escape\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mai:** I will be your opponent\. Everyone else, go on without me\.  
**Kanami:** Mai-cha--  
**Mai:** This is our best option now\! So hurry\! We're running out of time\.\.\.\!  
**Kanami:** But\.\.\.\!  
**Sayaka:** It's okay\. I'll protect Mai\.  
**Mai:** Sayaka-chan\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Kanami\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Catch up soon, okay you two\! We'll be waiting\!  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.Mai, are you mad?  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Mmhm\. I'm mad at the girl who wouldn't do as she's told\.  
**Sayaka:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mai:** That's why, as punishment\.\.\. I'll make you eat all my new cookies\.  
**Sayaka:** --I'll do it\.  
At the same time, with Kitora Mirja's B team--

  
**Kiyoka:** Wh-What\.\.\.?  
**Mirja:** These readings on the spectrum finder\. Maybe it's a result of the great aradama itself beginning to act\. But large numbers of aradama are appearing in the nearby area\.  
**Kiyoka:** N-No way\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** We can't lose hope yet\. It's never too late to give up, even after everything is over\.  
**Kiyoka:** R-Right\!  
**Toji:** \.\.\.You, over there\! You're intruders, aren't you\! I won't let you keep this up\!  

## 9: B Team (2\)
**Mirja:** Judging by the state of affairs here, Mokusa's members must be heading for the shrine\.  
**Mirja:** We should continue causing a disturbance to make their progression easier\. We need to buy them time, even if it could only amount to one second\.  
**Mirja:** That one second could make the difference between victory and defeat, after all\.  
**Yui:** Then let's keep on picking up girls-- Er, picking up guards\!  
**Kiyoka:** I'm glad you're with us, Yui-chan\.\.\. Your cheerfulness actually helps\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Oh, does that mean I'm slowly but surely winning you over? Then I'll just have to keep on showing you my good side\!  
**Yui:** Heeey\~, you there\! Don't you want to have a lovey dovey chat with me\~?  
**Kiyoka:** Ahaha\.\.\. Maybe I shouldn't have said that\.\.\.  

## 10: Clearing the Way (1\)
At the same time, in the way of Juujou Hiyori and Etou Kanami, who were headed for the shrine--

  
**Suzuka:** Hello there\. We haven't seen you since Izu\.  
**Maki:** We knew you'd come\.  
**Hiyori:** We're in a hurry\. So we're getting through here\.  
**Maki:** Do what you like\. But only if you can defeat us\.  
**Suzuka:** We were beaten quite handily last time, but that won't happen again\.  
**Suzuka:** It's meaningless to speak any further\. This is a matter of kill or be killed\.  
**Kanami:** Those eyes\.\.\.\!?  
**Hiyori:** That sinister glow\.\.\. So there's noro in your bodies after all\!  
**Hiyori:** You'd become half an aradama yourself just to protect Origami Yukari\!?  
**Maki:** Without the strength to back it up, justice is powerless-- There are things you can't protect without the power for it\.  
**Suzuka:** And there also a happiness brought about by being powerful\.  
**Maki:** If something can give me that power\.\.\. I don't care at all if it comes from a god or a demon\.  
**Suzuka:** Fufu, it's a rather simple way of pledging your allegiance, don't you agree?  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Kanami\!  
**Kanami:** Right\!  
At the same time, with Asakura Mihono's A team--

  
**Mihono:** Hyaaah-\!\!  
**Kofuki:** Tch\.\.\. They just keep popping out one after another\!  
**Chie:** As we get closer to the shrine, their defenses will be getting tighter\.\.\. And they're all considerable toji\.  
**Mihono:** Mm, we can't let our guard down for even an instant\.  
**Chie:** If this place is still so tightly guarded, it might actually mean Etou-san and the others haven't gotten this far yet\.  
**Mihono:** Thank goodness\. Then we can make things easier on Kanami before they get here\.\.\. It was a good idea coming here after all\.  
**Kofuki:** Still, it's gonna be rough taking all of them on with just the three of us\.  
**Mihono:** Just keep trying\! So long as we keep trying, I know we'll find a way\!  
**Kofuki:** Like usual, you're getting all confident with nothing to base it on\. But we don't have a choice, I guess\!  

## 10: Clearing the Way (2\)
**Toji:** Wh-What's with them\.\.\. There's just three of them, but they're so tough\.  
**Kofuki:** It's not about how many people you've got\!  
**Toji:** Khh\.\.\.\!\!  
**Chie:** The guards they have here are starting to lose their resolve\. Let's keep pushing them back like this\!  
**Kofuki:** This is where it counts, huh\!\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I'll give it all I've got\!  

## 12: An Unhappy Surprise (1\)
**Hiyori:** Gah\.\.\.\!  
**Maki:** I'll admit you've got talent, but you're still just an amateur\. I'll corner you this way\.  
**Hiyori:** Gh\.\.\. If you're\.\.\. If you're already so strong, why would you accept the noro\.\.\.\!  
**Maki:** Heh\.\.\. I've never once thought of myself as strong\.  
**Maki:** The ones I sought after were always so far away--  
**Maki:** The summit I look up to is impossibly high--  
**Maki:** Just to obtain the strength to stand at their side\.\.\. For my goals, I'll use whatever I can\. Aren't you the same?  
**Maki:** Now, this is\.\.\. Where it ends\!  
**Hiyori:** You might be right\. For my goal\.\.\. If it'll let me win against you, I'll use everything I can\.  
**Hiyori:** Like this\!  
**Maki:** You forcefully purged your S armor\!? But, that won't hit me\!  
**Hiyori:** It doesn't have to\. I just needed to throw off your posture for a second\!  
**Maki:** You mean, that's what you were after from the start\!?  
**Hiyori:** HAAAHHHHHHHHHH\!  
**Maki:** Well\.\.\. Done\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Pant, pant, pant, pant\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** It looks like you settled things over there too\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Yeah, I made it somehow\. We both seem pretty tired, but can you run?  
**Hiyori:** Of course\.  
At the same time, with Kitora Mirja's B Team--

  
**Aradama:** KIIGYAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** Aradama\!?  
**Toji A:** W-What are they doing here\!? This place should be better defended against aradama than anywhere, so how did they\.\.\.  
**Toji B:** We can worry about that later\. We need to focus on the enemy in front of us right now\!  
**Yui:** Uwah, an unhappy surprise showed up-\! Why did aradama have to join in now of all times\!  
**Mirja:** Thanks to their intervention, the guards are becoming further distracted\. We can use this situation\.  
**Yui:** Having to fight both the guards and the aradama at the same time is just making things so much harder\!  
**Yui:** Mirja-san, I'll try my best, so will you reward me by rubbing my head later?  
**Yui:** Just imagining you doing it while saying "Good girl, good girl" makes me feel like I could go out there and give 1000%\!  
**Mirja:** If that's what it takes to get you motivated, that's a small price to pay\.  
**Yui:** Yes\! Lucky me\! Alright\~, here I gooooo\!  

## 13: An Unhappy Surprise (2\)
**Kiyoka:** These aradama\.\.\. They're strong\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Is it the effect of the great aradama? Whatever the cause, we'll have to be careful\.  
**Kiyoka:** After this\.\.\. I think I don't want\.\.\. Any more surprises\.\.\.  
**Yui:** I know what you mean\. Giving someone an unwanted surprise is a crime, after all\!  
**Mirja:** There's more coming\. Prepare yourselves\!  
**Kiyoka:** U-Understood\.\.\.\!\!
