## [Star Ocean - Chie: Start\]: Potatoes
**Miki Sauvester:** Thanks for the food-\!  
**Chie:** Go ahead and eat\.  
**Miki:** [chew chew\]\.\.\.  
**Miki:** Mmm, it's so good\!  
**Chie:** Fufu, we got plenty, so have as many as you like\.  
**Miki:** Will do-\!  
**Miki:** Why do you think potatoes are so tasty? They're all warm and sweet and\.\.\. I'll take another\!  
**Chie:** Sure, here you go\.  
**Miki:** I bet I could keep eating these all night\!  
**Miki:** Another one\!  
**Chie:** Here\.  
**Miki:** One more\!  
**Chie:** Here you g\.\.\. Ah\. Sorry, Miki-san\.  
**Chie:** That was the last one just now\.\.\. Looks like I didn't get enough\. Should I go buy you one more?  
**Miki:** You will\!?  
**Chie:** You looked so happy eating them\. I was having fun just watching you go\.  
**Miki:** Thanks so much, Chie\!  
**Chie:** But, we're out here to find a biribiri plasma rod, so we have to make sure not to forget, okay?  
**Miki:** Sure we won't\!  
**Miki:** Aradama'll go down like nothing with all this potato power\!  
**Chie:** Oh, but it looks like the baked potato stand moved somewhere else\.  
**Miki:** That just means we can look for them again while we look for the aradama\.  
**Miki:** That way it's two birds with one stone\.  
**Chie:** That's true; let's do that then\.  
**Chie:** Oh?  
**Chie:** It looks like we found the aradama before the baked potatoes\. Let's go take care of them, Miki-san\.  
**Miki:** Alright, Chie\!  
**Miki:** We'll get that biribiri plasma rod and then have another helping of potatoes in peace\!  
**Chie:** Sure\!  

## [Star Ocean - Chie: End\]: I Prefer Potatoes to Aradama
**Miki:** Rock Rain\!  
**Aradama:** GYAH\!?  
**Miki:** Earth Grave\!  
**Aradama:** GUOH\!?  
**Miki:** Shiny Lancer\!  
**Aradama:** GAAAAAAAA\!?  
**Miki:** Miki-chan's the strongest\!  
**Chie:** That's amazing\.\.\. So that's what you can do, Miki-san\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Should I\.\.\. just think of that as magic?  
**Miki:** It's called signeturgy\.  
**Miki:** I'm best at healing signeturgy, but not that great at attacks\.\.\. I'm just giving it my best shot for the potatoes\!  
**Miki:** But, I can't finish them off, so the rest is up to you, Chie\!  
**Chie:** Of course, just leave it to me\.  
**Chie:** YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Chie:** That should do it\.  
**Chie:** Though\.\.\. From the looks of it, these aradama didn't have the biribiri plasma rod\.  
**Miki:** Oh, that's too bad\.  
**Miki:** We're having a tough time finding an aradama with one, aren't we\.  
**Chie:** We are\.\.\.  
**Baked Potato Stand:** Get your stone baked sweet potatoes\~\!  
**Miki:** Ah\.\.\.  
**Miki:** I'm hungry now, after going all out\.  
**Chie:** We did beat a lot of aradama, so we'll have to do something to reward ourselves\. Why don't we go get some potatoes?  
**Miki:** Sure\!  
**Miki:** The ones from earlier are already done digesting, so let's get a whole bunch\!  
**Chie:** A bunch\.\.\. In that case, let's buy enough to bring back for everyone\.  
**Miki:** We're bringing them back for everybody\.\.\. What should we do, Chie\!?  
**Miki:** What if that stall doesn't have enough potatoes for us all\!?  
**Chie:** Just how many were you thinking of bringing back\!?

## [Star Ocean - Mihono: Start\]: Found a Ramen Stall\!
**Mihono:** Hmm, there's nothing on the spectrum finder\. We're not really finding anything, huh\.  
**Miki:** That's for sure\. We're over here looking around every corner for them, so the least they could do is show up a little\.  
**Mihono:** I know\!  
**Miki:** And now I'm feeling kind of hungry\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ugh, me too\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Want to\.\.\. go get some food?  
**Miki:** Sure\! Let's do that\!  
**Miki:** Tell me where you like to eat, Mihono\!  
**Mihono:** Hmm, someplace I like to eat\.\.\. It's a little far, but\.\.\.  
**Miki:** Ugh\.\.\. It's far away\.\.\.  
**Miki:** I don't think my stomach is going to make it that far\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Actually, I think mine's the same\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** What's something tasty nearby\.\.\. Something tasty nearby\.\.\.

**Miki:** Eh?  
**Mihono:** Eh?  
**Mihono:** I mean, you had stuff from the whole menu, right\.\.\.?  
**Miki:** I ate them all, but I didn't drink all the soup, so it's all good\!  
**Mihono:** (Is that really all good\.\.\.?\)  
**Miki:** I actually wanted to have some more of it, but, see, it's already nighttime? So I held off a little\.  
**Mihono:** Y-Yeah, I guess\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** (I feel like she already ate a whole bunch though\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** B-But, we did go looking around all day today, so it's fine to eat that much\.\.\. right?  
**Miki:** Yeah, it's fine\!  
**Miki:** So come on, let's work it off and go look around over that way, Mihono\!  

## [Star Ocean - Mihono: End\]: Found Some Cats\!
**Mihono:** It sorta feels like we're just going on a walk together after we got that ramen\.  
**Miki:** Do aradama take the nights off or something?  
**Mihono:** Well, we still get tons of missions at night too\.\.\. And then it gets really hard waking up the next day\.\.\.  
**Miki:** Ahaha, toji sure have it rough too, huh\.  
**Mihono:** --\!? That meow just now\!\!  
**Miki:** Mihono?  
**Mihono:** I feel like it came from that way\.\.\. Let's go and check, Miki-san\!  
**Mihono:** Meowww, meowww\. Where are you, kitty-?  
**Miki:** You heard it from over here, right?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! I'm pretty sure it's right around here\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** There they are\!  
**Miki:** Where, where\!?  
**Mihono:** Right here\! There's two of them, Miki-san\!  
**Miki:** Ah, I see them\! They're so cute\!  
**Mihono:** Yeah\!  
**Mihono:** Will you let me pet you, meow-?  
**Cat:** \.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ah, she turned her head away\.\.\.  
**Miki:** Ahaha, looks like she's telling you no\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Hey, they ran off\!  
**Miki:** They looked like they were strays, so maybe they were being cautious of you?  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I just wanted to pet them\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Next time I find them, I'm gonna pet them for sure\!  
**Miki:** Ahaha, I'm rooting for you\!  
**Mihono:** We didn't find any geregere slime, but this was pretty fun, huh Miki-san\!  
**Miki:** It was\!  
**Miki:** The ramen tasted really good, and the cats\.\.\. well, it's too bad about that\.  
**Miki:** I wouldn't mind going on another walk at night with you, Mihono\!  
**Mihono:** Sure\! Let's go do this again\!

**Rena:** Yui\.\.\.  
**Rena:** Okay, let's fight together\!  
**Yui:** Yeah\!  
**Rena:** We beat the aradama\.\.\. but I didn't see any energy stones\.  
**Yui:** Mmm, looks like they were just normal aradama after all\.  
**Yui:** But, we took care of them and neither of us got hurt, so it's all okay either way\!  
**Rena:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Rena:** You're pretty popular with girls, aren't you, Yui?  
**Yui:** D-Does that mean you started falling for me?
