## [Xmas' 20 - Mihono: Start\]: The Investigation Team's Christmas Party (Preparations\)
**Mihono:** Jingle bells\~, jingle bells\~\.  
**Mirja:** Stop singing and put your hands to work\. We won't finish getting ready for the Christmas party at this rate\.  
**Mihono:** Okaaay\!  
**Chie:** Hey, Mirja\. About the cooking for the party\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** That's right\.\.\. I'll leave everything to you, Setouchi Chie\. You're our best when it comes to cooking\.  
**Chie:** Alright then\.  
**Chie:** Everyone, can I have a moment? For the cooking for the party, does anyone have any requests?  
**Tsugumi:** Cooking, hm\. Should I help with that?  
**Kofuki:** Hell no\! Are you trying to ruin everybody's Christmas\!?  
**Tsugumi:** That's a shame\.  
**Kofuki:** Anyway, what about that? That chicken\! That tasted so good\.  
**Kiyoka:** That chicken\.\.\. I'm pretty sure Hono-chan bought it, right?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! It was from this meat shop I stumbled across\.  
**Mihono:** It smelled so good walking past the store, so I tried some croquettes, and they were really yummy\! So I decided to get chicken from there\.  
**Mihono:** Their croquettes, meatcakes, ham cutlets\.\.\. They all tasted good\.  
**Mihono:** The meatcakes were so juicy, and the ham cutlets were really thick\!  
**Kofuki:** [gulp\] Just hearing you talk about them's making me hungry\.\.\. Wait, hold up\. I don't remember eating any croquettes?  
**Mihono:** Cause I didn't buy any\.  
**Mihono:** I mean, wouldn't croquettes for Christmas be weird?  
**Kofuki:** If they're tasty, then buy 'em too\!  
**Mihono:** Well I got us chicken, didn't I\!  
**Chie:** Okay, that's enough, you two\.  
**Chie:** Is everyone alright with having Mihono-chan get us chicken again this year?  
**Kofuki:** No complaints here\! Anyway, Mihocchi, where's this place at? Let's go get some croquettes\.  
**Mihono:** Let's go make the reservation together then, Fukki\.  
**Kofuki:** That works\.  
**Kofuki:** While we're at it, let's order a buncha stuff besides chicken\. We gotta get croquettes and meatcakes and ham cutlets\!  
**Chie:** Don't go deciding that on your own\.\.\. That's nothing but fried food\. I think I'd better prepare lots of vegetables for us\.  

## [Xmas' 20 - Mihono: Start\]: The Investigation Team's Christmas Party
On Christmas Day\.

  
**Mihono:** HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Aradama:** Oooo\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Even though it's Christmas, we still got a mission\!  
**Kofuki:** What're you complaining about, Mihocchi\! Doesn't this make the best Christmas present\!  
**Kofuki:** I love you\! Aradama-chan\!  
**Aradama:** Aaaa\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** You're the only one who'd think that, Fukki\!  
**Mihono:** And they're spider types too\.\.\. That's not the kind of aradama people wanna see on Christmas\!  
**Kofuki:** What kinda aradama do they want to see on Christmas?  
**Mihono:** Like, Kaoru-san's Nene-chan\! There's gotta be people out there who'd want a Christmas version Nenegurumi\!  
**Mihono:** I mean, I'd want one\!  
**Mihono:** But, if Nene-chan attacked me, I couldn't hurt him\.\.\. What should I do, Fukki\!?  
**Kofuki:** How am I supposed to know\!  
**Kofuki:** Anyway, the next one's coming\! Quit messing around\!  
**Mihono:** Alright\!  
**Mihono:** [snooze\]\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Orah, next one\.\.\. [snooze\]  
**Chie:** Just when we got things set up, they all fell asleep\.  
**Mirja:** They had a tough mission\. It's understandable\.  
**Yui:** Uhehe, uhehe\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** U-ughh\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.Honestly, just what dreams are they having\.  
**Chie:** Fufu\.  
**Chie:** Since everything's ready, do you want to try a bit of the food?  
**Mirja:** Okay, I will\. Though, we should limit it to the salad\.  
**Chie:** That's true; they'd all be disappointed if the main dishes ran out\.
