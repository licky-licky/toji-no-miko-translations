## 1: Why Not Take This Chance to Enjoy Ourselves\?
**Kiyoka:** Wow\! So this is Harajuku\! Everyone's so fashionable\! Look at all the shops\! And it smells so nice here, Mirja-senpai\!  
**Mirja:** Yes, Harajuku is truly a nice place\.  
**Mihono:** What's, uh, going on\? Why did we actually go to Harajuku\?  
**Chie:** Even your onee-san is at a complete loss for words\.  
**Kofuki:** The hell\.\.\. There's no aradama anywhere round here\!  
**Mirja:** Let me make this clear, we're on a serious mission\. If your intention in going to Harajuku is simply to sightsee, then\.\.\. Hm\? Harajuku\.\.\.\?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\. \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\. \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** No, that's a good idea, Harajuku\. If I recall, that's where the sword shop Aoto-kan is located\.  
**Mirja:** Our mission isn't exactly time sensitive either\. As Musumi Kiyoka-san has suggested, Harajuku may be a good place to pick up information\.  
**Everyone:** Ehh-\!\?  
**Mihono:** Well, since we're already here, we might as well enjoy it, right\?  
**Chie:** I guess, but\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Is there something you're worried about, Chii-nee\?  
**Chie:** Eh, No\.\.\. It's nothing\. You're right, those of us from the west side of Japan rarely get to visit Tokyo\.  
**Chie:** It'd be a waste not to have fun while we're here\.  
**Mihono:** We're from Chubu, not Kansai, Chii-nee\. Ah\! Ice cream, let's have ice cream\! Just look at the line at that place\! It must be really good\!  
**Kofuki:** \.\.\.Ahh, whatever\. I'm just gonna walk around\. Seeya\!  

## 2: Another Encounter with the Two Birds
**Mihono:** Fufu\~, ice cream, ice cream, we all scream for ice cream\~\! Chii-nee, what do you want\? I'm having melon sherbet\!  
**Chie:** Even you get swept away the moment there's sweets involved, hm, Mihono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** Ehh\? It's not like I wanted to come here or anything\. But come on, it's Harajuku\! Every girl wants to come here at least once\. Right\?  
**Chie:** You're not wrong\. Well, I'll have cotton candy flavor\.  
**Mihono:** Cot on\.\.\. Candee\?  
**Chie:** Watagashi flavor\. (Japanese cotton candy\)  
**Mihono:** Oh\! I got it\! I'll be right back\!  
**Kiyoka:** Um, can I look at that western fashion shop\? I love their brand\! And that shop over there, they sell the cutest boots\!  
**Chie:** What do you think, Mirja-san\?  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.I see no reason not to\. Then, I'll accompany Musumi Kiyoka-san\.  
**Kiyoka:** Really\!\? Let's go\! You're so tall, Mirja-san; I bet you'd look good in anything\. I'm so jealous\.  
**Chie:** Everyone's just ordinary girls in the end, hm\. Maybe Kiyoka-san has that effect on everyone\?  
**Chie:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Chie:** I'd better catch up with Mihono-chan\~\.  
**Chie:** I'm here, Mihono-chan\. I thought I ought to line up with you at least\.\.\. What's wrong\?  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee\.\.\. Look\. In the shop\.\.\.  
**Chie:** At what\.\.\. Eh\!\? Isn't that Etou Kanami-san and Juujou Hiyori-san\? What do you want to do\? Should we talk to them\?  
**Mihono:** I want to, but I shouldn't\. If we did, Mirja-san and the others might find out about them\.  
**Chie:** That'd be bad for them, wouldn't it\. Then we should\.\.\. Wait\!\? Mihono-chan\! The spectrum finder is going off\!  
**Mihono:** It found aradama nearby\!\? Show it to me\.\.\.\! It's coming from\.\.\. Over by\.\.\. It looks like Yoyogi Park\! Hurry\! We have to get everyone together and go\!  

## 3: Team-Up\? (1\)
**Local Broadcast:** [This is an emergency broadcast\.\.\. Currently, aradama have been reported on Takeshita street\. Do not approach the area until the riot squad arrives\. Police officers, please follow the toji's instructions and help evacuate the area immediately\.\]  
**Mihono:** They finally made a broadcast\! Local toji should be coming to help soon\!  
**Chie:** It's still up to us to hold out until they get here, though\!  
**Kofuki:** Heh\! Then I'm gonna have my fill before they show up and spoil the fun\!  
**Mirja:** Stop\! Shichinosato Kofuki\! Don't push forward\! If you move the aradama in that direction, you'll be putting civilians in danger\!  
**Mirja:** Kh\.\.\. It's no use\.\.\.\! In all the chaos, my voice can't reach Shichinosato Kofuki\!  
**Mirja:** (What should be done here\.\.\.\?\)  
**Mirja:** (I could have Asakura Mihono chase after her\.\.\. However, I doubt she would be capable of bringing Shichinosato Kofuki back\. As far as tactics go this is a terrible choice, but, if only for a minute\.\.\.\)  
**Mirja:** Setouchi Chie-san\! I'm leaving this to you\! Hold this position until I bring back Shichonosato Kofuki\!  
**Chie:** Eh\!\?  
**Kiyoka:** Um\! W-What\.\.\. What should I be doing\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Kyaa\!  
**Chie:** Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Mihono:** Protect Musumi-san, Chii-nee\! I don't know how long I can keep it up for, but\.\.\. I'll draw the aradama to me\!  

## 4: Team-Up\? (2\)
**Chie:** Kiyoka-chan\! Keep it together\! That's where the aradama are coming from\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ah, I-I'm sorry\! I just\.\.\. Kyaa\!  
**Mihono:** Ahh\! Don't run away, Musumi-san\! That's dangerous\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** (\.\.\.I suspected it, but\.\.\. Can Musumi-san really not fight\?\)  
**Mihono:** (Even though she's a toji\!\?\)  
**Chie:** (I have my hands full just protecting Kiyoka-chan\! Mihono-chan can't last much longer\.\.\.\)  
**Chie:** (Just one more\! If just one more person were here\! Then we could at least hold out until Kitora-san returns\!\)  
**\?\?\?:** Allow me to help\!  
**Chie:** \!\?  
**Mai:** Osafune toji\! I'll be under your command, so instruct me as you see fit\!  
**Mihono:** Huh\? Yanase-san\! Why are you here\!\?  
**Mai:** Asakura-san\!\? I'm here to find Kanami-chan\! But I can explain later\!  
**Mihono:** G-Got it\!  

## 5: Newly Arrived Ally, Ma<i> (1\)
(there's a pun in the title with the second kanji of Mai's name, meaning clothing, isolated\)

  
**Mai:** Ha\!  
**Mai:** Ya\!  
**Mihono:** (Fighting up close with her like this, I can tell\. Yanase-san's swordsmanship\.\.\. It's so beautiful\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** (She's so focused, but her movements aren't rigid at all\.\.\.\)  
**Mihono:** (You can see how dedicated she was to her training, but she isn't bound to the standards\.\)  
**Mihono:** (With a firm grip, she pushes through with her own style\.\)  
**Mihono:** (I didn't get to fight her in the qualifiers, but if I had\.\.\. I think I would have lost\. These are the skills that got her second place\.\.\.\)  
**Mai:** Oh\.\.\. Asakura-san\! That one's headed your way\!  
**Mihono:** Nn\! I got it\!  
**Mai:** Good work, Asakura-san\. I can see why Kanami-chan praised you so much\.  
**Mihono:** Huh\? Kanami did\?  
**Mai:** Yes, even the other day at the inn\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** That match against Mihono-chan was the best in the qualifiers\. She kept pulling out technique after technique; I couldn't tell what would come next\! There was no end to it; I wish I could see more\.\.\.  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Is what she said\.  
**Mihono:** Ahh\.\.\. I'm blushing so hard I'm gonna melt\.\.\.  
**Mai:** And then, she also wondered why you gave up halfway through\.  
**Mihono:** And now I wanna crawl in a hole\.\.\. But Yanase-san, you also-  
**Mai:** Just call me Mai\.  
**Mihono:** Eh\?  
**Mai:** Just Mai is fine\. And then, can I call you Mihono-chan\?  
**Mai:** The truth is, I was a little curious\.\.\. No, I couldn't get it out of my head\. After Kanami-chan couldn't stop talking about you, I wondered what you were like\.  
**Mai:** I think\.\.\. I got a little jealous, is all\.  

## 6: Newly Arrived Ally, Ma<i> (2\)
**Mihono:** Yanase-san\.\.\. I mean, Mai-chan\.\.\. Err, Mai\. You said you came here to find Kanami, right\?  
**Mai:** Last night, I got a call from Kanami-chan\. I had my family's butler trace her location\.  
**Mihono:** \!\! She's a rich girl\! I had heard about it, but it's really hitting me now how rich you are\!\!  
**Mai:** Ah\.\.\. Well, you see, the tracing confirmed she's in this area\. And\.\.\.  
**Mai:** This is good timing\. You chased down Kanami-chan too, didn't you\? I wanted to ask you about that\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah, I did\. I managed to catch up with them after the tournament\. Kanami, she told me\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** I'm sorry, but, I can't let you stop her\! That girl must have a reason for this\! There's a good reason for all of this, I know it\!  
**Kanami:** After all, I saw it\.\.\. Back then\.\.\. Behind Yukari-sama\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.No, forget it\. Just know that, right now\.\.\. I won't let you stop her\!  
**Mai:** I see\. Kanami-chan said all that\.\.\. I really have to go talk to her myself\. As her best friend, I owe it to her\!  

## 7: Investigation Team\.\.\. Team-Up\! (1\)
**Chie:** Kitora-san, Shichinosato-san\! Thank goodness, you made it back\.\.\.\!  
**Mirja:** I'm sorry for making you hold this spot on your own\. As of now, Kitora Mirja and Shichinosato Kofuki will be joining the battle\.  
**Chie:** Understood, I'm ready for your orders\.  
**Mirja:** I'll take charge then\.  
**Kofuki:** Tch\.\.\. Oi\! Why are we wasting time talking\! I only came back cause you promised I'd get the biggest aradama here\! Are we gonna get to it or what\!\?  
**Mai:** Excuse me\!  
**Mirja:** You are\.\.\.\?  
**Mai:** I'm Yanase Mai, from Minoseki\. Please let me assist you\.  
**Mirja:** Of course, I'd never turn that down\. Then, Yanase Mai-san, please take point\.  
**Mirja:** The riot squad should be arriving soon\. However, with our combined efforts, we should be able to clear away these aradama who would desecrate Harajuku\.  
**Mirja:** Now then\.\.\. Get in position\! Investigation team\.\.\. Team-up\!  

## 8: Investigation Team\.\.\. Team-Up\! (2\)
**Chie:** It seems like most of the aradama are taken care of\. Thank goodness\.  
**Kiyoka:** The riot squad made it, and all the civilians seem to have been evacuated too\.  
**Mihono:** That's good to hear\.\.\. Alright\! Mai\!  
**Mihono:** Go after Kanami, Mai\! We can handle the rest here\.  
**Mai:** Okay\.\.\. I'm going\!  
**Mihono:** B&B Ice Cream\!  
**Mai:** \?  
**Mihono:** Just before, I saw Kanami and that Heijou girl eating ice cream there\!  
**Mai:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\!  
**Mai:** \.\.\.Thank you, Mihono-chan\. I'll definitely find her and talk to her\!  

## 9: We're Here\! Welcome to Aoto-kan\!
**Mirja:** All aradama in the area have been confirmed destroyed\.  
**Mirja:** Collection of the noro is mostly complete too, so from here we can leave it to the riot squad and continue on to Aoto-kan\.  
\.\.\.30 minutes later\.

  
**Mihono:** Aoto-kan\.\.\. I've heard of it before, but I don't really remember\.\.\. They make scabbards and handles and stuff, right\?  
**Mirja:** That's right\. Though it isn't affiliated with the sword administration, Aoto-kan provides scabbards for many toji\.  
**Mirja:** Of course, it's not uncommon for a blade to be used with the mountings it's assigned with\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** But, for more particular toji, they offer a variety of customization options\. From the scabbard and the handle, all the way to the hand guard and hilt collar, they take custom orders for every part besides the blade itself\.  
**Mirja:** It goes without saying that, to those toji, Aoto-kan is a place we greatly admire\. Of course, I fall into that group as well\.  
**Mirja:** Every school now offers training courses for their own craftsmen\. However, even toji from Minoseki, which places the greatest emphasis on such students\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Commonly find themselves thinking they'll become regular customers here, I believe\.  
**Mirja:** Of course, you are from Minoseki yourself, Asakura Mihono-san\. I'm sure this is mostly common knowledge to you\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\.\.\.I had no idea\. Please forgive me\.  
**Kiyoka:** I know what you mean\! If a shirasaya* is casual wear, then coordinating all the mountings together is an important part of a girl's fashion arsenal\!  
*(shirasaya consists of only a plain wooden scabbard and hilt, intended for storing the blade and not at all practical in combat\)

  
**Mihono:** I'm not too sure about that comparison\.\.\.\? I mean, I get it, but\.\.\. An okatana is your partner in protecting everyone, and\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Sigh\.\.\. You don't get it\.  
**Mihono:** Eh\?  
**Kiyoka:** Mihono-san, you don't get it\! Picking out the right parts is as important as picking out clothes for a date\! For girls like us, it's a vital part of our outfit\!  
**Mihono:** Eh\.\.\. O-Okay\. \.\.\.Wait, d-d-date\!\? Musumi-san, have you been on dates before\!\?  
**Mihono:** S-So mature\!  
**Kiyoka:** I-I haven't\.  
**Kiyoka:** I just mean that, I've read about it\.\.\. And daydreamed about it\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Anyway, are we ready to enter\? We can't stand out here talking all day; we should go in and introduce ourselves to the store owner\. By the way, the owner, Aoto Youji-san is\.\.\.  
**\?\?\?:** Real handsome\.  
**Mirja:** \.\.\.\!  
**Aoto Youji:** Nice to meet you girls\. You came by as customers, right\? And to have my pick of 5 cute toji to boot\.  
**Aoto Youji:** Pretty rare to see each of you wearing a different uniform, but from where I'm standing it's like looking at a garden of flowers\. Ain't that right, ladies\?  
**Kiyoka:** Cute\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ladies\.\.\.  
**Chie:** Oh my, angels from heaven, that's going too far\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Huh\? He didn't say that one\!  
**Mirja:** I'm sorry we caused a commotion outside your store\.  
**Aoto Youji:** Don't worry your pretty little head over it\. If you came for consultation, I'll help you with anything besides the blades of your swords\. Consider it on the house\!  
**Aoto Hina:** Dangit, pa\! Quit ogling the customers\! It's embarrassing\!   
**Aoto Youji:** \.\.\.Ooh, now I've done it\. This here's my daughter\. Normally she's at Renpu, but she's paying me a visit after the tournament\.  
**Aoto Hina:** That's what I told Renpu, but I'm actually just helping out the shop\. I mean, with all those toji in Kamakura for the tournament, lots of them are gonna end up stopping by\.  
**Aoto Hina:** Ah, I know\! Do you all want to help work the place today and tomorrow\? We'll give you bed and breakfast\!  
**Aoto Hina:** We'll inspect your okatana at a discount to boot\!  
**Mirja:** No, we're on a mission right now\.\.\.
