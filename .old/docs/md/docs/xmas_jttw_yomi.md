## [Xmas' 19 - Yomi: Start\]: An Unpredictable Present
**Yomi:** A Christmas Eve party\.\.\.\?  
**Suzuka:** Yes, all toji from the Five Traditions are gathering for a big occasion, and of course, we of the elite guard have been invited as well\.  
**Yomi:** I see\. I have some business I want to take care of before the end of the year, so please go without me\.  
**Maki:** Well, we can't do that\. Since it's a big party, we got permission from Yukari-sama, saying we should all go\.  
**Suzuka:** And Yume seems to be trying her best at getting something ready\. It would be terrible if you weren't there\.  
**Yomi:** Is that right\.\.\. Then, I suppose I'll have to go\. Is there anything I need to prepare in advance\?  
**Maki:** It said on the invitation they're doing a gift exchange at the end of the party, so everybody needs to have one gift ready\.  
**Suzuka:** With all the people that should be there, an exchange should be exciting\. I should get mine ready straight away\~\.  
**Maki:** Wait up, Suzuka\! I want your advice on what to go with\. I'm coming with you\!  
**Yomi:** The two of them left\. Sigh\.\.\. A gift exchange\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** A gift which you can't anticipate who will be receiving it\.\.\. That's a fairly difficult request\.  
**Yomi:** A present that would make anyone happy\.\.\. Something that, no matter how many people got it, they would be happy with\.\.\. Like, for example, delicious white rice\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** Ah-\! That's what I could do\.  
**Yomi:** I've reached a stopping point in my duties, so I'll quickly go out to do some shopping\.  
**Yomi:** I may have bought a bit too much, but I suppose I'll get right to cooking\. It's a good thing the kitchen was available\.  
**Ellen:** Wow\! Yomiyomi\! I don't often run into you in a place like this\~\!  
**Kiyoka:** Are we maybe getting in your way\?  
**Yomi:** No, it's fine so long as I can use the faucet and stove\. You can use the next counter over if it's fine with you\.  
**Kiyoka:** Thanks for that then\! Though, you sure have a lot of rice\. And a nice big pot\.  
**Ellen:** Are you getting ready for the Christmas party or something\?  
**Yomi:** Yes, they said we would need something for the gift exchange, so I was thinking of using a type of rice that tastes delicious when cold to make omusubi\.  
**Ellen:** Wow\! Now that's a coincidence\~\! Kiyoka and I were here to make sweets for the present exchange too\.  
**Kiyoka:** I'm baking cookies, and Ellen-san was going to make muffins\.  
**Yomi:** I see, sweets are a standard gift for schoolgirls\. You do often see them decorated for Christmas on sale around town\.  
**Yomi:** To give omusubi as a Christmas present\.\.\. Maybe what I'm making will be out of place\.  
**Kiyoka:** That's not true at all\! Even with onigiri, depending on how you decorate them, they can definitely be cute Christmas presents\!  
**Ellen:** That's right\~\! Christmas style onigiri\! If I got something like that, I'd be extra happy\!  
**Kiyoka:** Um, if it's alright, could we help you make them\? We'll make a Christmas style onigiri bento\!  
**Ellen:** Definitely\~\! I'll help with Yomiyomi's onigiri bento too\!  
**Yomi:** Musumi-san, Kohagura-san, thank you both\. I appreciate you wanting to help\. However, what I want to make is not onigiri bento\.  
**Kiyoka/Ellen:** Eh\?  
**Yomi:** It's omusubi bento\.

## [Xmas' 19 - Yomi: End\]: The Fun of Giving
**Kiyoka:** Still though, Christmas style onigi\.\.\. Ah-\! Omusubi\! How do you think those should look\?  
**Ellen:** For cakes, something called a Buche de Noel is popular\. It's a roll cake decorated to look like a log of wood\.  
**Yomi:** I see, a log of wood\.\.\. If it were a sushi roll, I could make it look that way\.  
**Kiyoka:** It wouldn't be very Christmas-like though, would it\.  
**Yomi:** Since it's difficult expressing Christmas through the shape\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** I know\! For Christmas onigi\.\.\. Ah-\! Omusubi\! What about this\? You could bring out the feeling with red and green ingredients\.  
**Yomi:** Red and green\.\.\. In that case, I have umeboshi and shiyazuke for red, and shiso leaves for green\.  
**Ellen:** Both of those would go perfect with onigi\.\.\. Rice balls\!  
**Kiyoka:** That was a nice save, Ellen-san\.  
**Yomi:** Thank you both\. With your suggestions, I should be able to make these omusubi feel like Christmas\.  
**Kiyoka:** I'm glad we could help\. Then, Ellen-san, we should get to making our own sweets now\.  
**Ellen:** You're right\. Though, Kiyoka, you sure have a lot of shapes for cutting cookies\.  
**Ellen:** There's Santa Claus, reindeers, stars\. They all feel like Christmas\!  
**Kiyoka:** They're all so cute, so I couldn't help but bring them out\.\.\. Ah, I know\! Satsuki-san, I came up with something good\!  
**Yomi:** Something good\?  
**Kiyoka:** If you use my cookie cutters, and cut out a bit of omelette\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Wow\! That's a pretty Christmas star\! If you put that with Yomiyomi's rice balls\.\.\.\!  
**Yomi:** It looks beautiful\.\.\. Like a Christmas tree inside the bento box\.  
**Kiyoka:** It really is\! It turned out cuter than I thought\!  
**Ellen:** Whoever gets this lunch box during the gift exchance will be very happy\!  
**Kiyoka:** Yeah\! I'm sure they'll be happy with it\! I'm looking forward to tomorrow\.  
**Yomi:** Thank you very much\. Now I won't feel uncomfortable joining the party\. Then, I'll be leaving now\.  
**Kiyoka:** Please wait a minute\! Since we're exchanging gifts, it'd be a waste to leave it at that\!  
**Ellen:** For the exchange, you can't not wrap it up all cute\~\.  
**Yomi:** You do have a lot of ribbons and wrapping paper\.  
**Kiyoka:** Maybe it would be cuter with a gap between the inside and outside\! What do you think about this ribbon\? Ah, or this one might be cute too\!  
**Ellen:** You always do have an awesome eye for design, Kiyoka\~\. Which do you like, Yomiyomi\?  
**Yomi:** I\.\.\. think both are fine\. I'll go with whatever you choose\.  
**Kiyoka:** Alright then\! If we tie this ribbon on, it's ready\!  
**Yomi:** My omusubi became such a cute present\.\.\. Musumi-san, Kohagura-san, I can't thank you enough\.  
The day of the Christmas Eve party\.

  
**Mirja:** Now then, for the final event of the party, all who joined us will be exchanging gifts\. Everyone, do you all have your presents ready\?  
**Kanami/Mai/Yume:** We dooo\!  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** What's the matter, Satsuki-san\? The gift exchange is starting\.  
**Yomi:** Musumi-san\. Everyone seems to have brought such proper gifts, so are omusubi really alright\.\.\.\?  
**Kiyoka:** It'll be fine\. I know for sure someone will be glad to get it\. Aren't you excited to see the happy look on their face when they open it\?  
**Yomi:** The face they make\.\.\. I hadn't thought about it, but you're right\. I am a little interested\.  
**Ellen:** Yomiyomi, Kiyoka\! They're starting the gift exchange\. Let's go over\!  
**Yomi:** Alright\.  
**Yomi:** (The happy face of the person who receives it\.\.\. That's the fun of giving presents, isn't it\.\.\.\)

## [Journey to the West - Yomi: Start\]: What Is Tsubakuro-san Going to Do\?
**Yukari:** Satsuki\. Konohana will be joining me at this evening's conference\. I won't be needing an escort\. You'll be assisting Shidou instead\.  
**Yomi:** Understood\.  
**Suzuka:** Maki-san\. If there's an urgent request for aid, please do all you can\.  
**Maki:** Sure, you can count on us\.  
**Yukari:** We'll be going then\.  
**Yume:** Huh-\? Did Yukari-sama and Suzuka-onee-san go out somewhere\?  
**Yomi:** They just left for a conference\.  
**Yume:** Ehh, but I thought I'd get Yukari-sama to play with me\. It feels like you onee-sans have been really busy lately\.  
**Yomi:** Apart from our aradama suppression missions, there's always something to take care of\.  
**Yume:** But because of that, we haven't gotten to play at all\. Or, actually, haven't we barely been able to get the four of us together lately\?  
**Maki:** You're right\. The rate of aradama appearances isn't dropping at all though\. There's too much work needing toji to do it\.  
**Yume:** If it's aradama, then I can beat as many as I have to\!  
**Yomi:** It's reassuring to have you, Tsubakuro-san, but you can't respond to aradama appearing in multiple locations at once\.  
**Yomi:** Looking at the whole picture, even if you are very active, it won't reduce the overall work of toji that much\.  
**Yume:** Mmgh\.  
**Maki:** Though, I get what Yume's saying\. But it's hard getting all of us time off at the same time\.  
**Yume:** Then, it'd be fine if it's not when we have time off\?  
**Yomi:** \.\.\.What do you mean\?  
**Yume:** You'll find out later\~\.  
**Yume:** There's something I've gotta go do real quick\.  
**Yomi:** What do you think she's up to\?  
**Maki:** No idea\.\.\. But, it's always a bit scary when Yume gets an idea\.  
**Yume:** Hey hey, Onee-san\. There's a little something I want you do to for me, okay\?  
**Tsugumi:** If it's something I can manage, then I don't mind\.  
**Yume:** Y'see--  
A few days later\.

  
**Suzuka:** I recieved a message from Yume earlier, but do you know what this is about, Yomi-san\?  
**Yomi:** No\. I only know that, several days ago, she seemed to be planning something\.  
**Suzuka:** Well, we're lucky to be spending some time together, though it's only for a few hours\.  
**Yomi:** That's true\. I'm slightly looking forward to it\.

## [Journey to the West - Yomi: End\]: It Might Be Nice to Continue Our Journey
**Maki:** Hey\.\.\. Yomi\. What are we doing here, anyway\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** What are you saying now, Pigsy\? I'm Sandy\. And we have to defeat these bandits to rescue our master\.  
**Maki:** Didn't think you'd get so into this\.\.\. Uh, Sandy\.  
**Yomi:** That was a joke\.  
**Yomi:** I wasn't sure what to expect when Tsubakuro-san invited us for training, but I didn't imagine we would be using the VR facilities\.  
**Maki:** I'm still not completely used to this whole VR thing\.\.\. But it's useful if you think of this as time spent strengthening the SDDT's coordination\.  
**Maki:** Though, did it really need to be done up like Journey to the West\.\.\.\?  
**Yomi:** This training program seems to be popular\. And also, I think Tsubakuro-san is fitting for the role of the Monkey King\.  
**Maki:** The Monkey King's wild and uncontrollable side might be a good fit for her\. Though, I'm not that on board with me being Pigsy\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** Is it bothering you\? I didn't think you'd mind\. I've heard that Pigsy is a popular character in China\.  
**Maki:** Is he really\?  
**Yomi:** Yes\.  
**Yomi:** But, right now, there's something we have to do to break our master out, Pigsy\.  
**Maki:** That's what I mean, calling me Pigsy is\.\.\. Forget it\.\.\. Let's go, Sandy\!  
**Yomi:** Please take point\. I'll cover our backs\.  
**Maki:** On it\! We've got to make a diversion so the Monkey King can break out Master Tripitaka\!  
**Yomi:** Right, let's bring these bandits to justice\.  
**Suzuka:** That was a rather worthwhile training session, wasn't it\.  
**Yume:** Yeah, it was pretty fun\! Though, I was pretty surprised when you started beating bad guys up halfway through, Suzuka-onee-san\.  
**Suzuka:** Since this was a training exercise, there was no need for a Tripitaka who did nothing but be protected, was there\?  
**Maki:** Our Master Tripitaka's highly capable, after all\. Those bandits shouldn't have let their guard down\.  
**Suzuka:** I would have liked to have seen you two in action as well though, Pigsy, Sandy\.  
**Yomi:** In that case, should we continue this journey until the end\?  
**Yume:** I'm up for that\! Let's keep going till we beat the Ox King\!  
**Yomi:** Tsubakuro-san, Tripitaka's goal isn't to defeat the Ox King\. We're traveling to Tianzhu\.\.\. to India, to retreive the scriptures\.  
**Yume:** Oh, we are\? Then, let's go until we get them\!  
**Yume:** But wait, let's have Yukari-sama be the Ox King\! It'll totally be worth fighting her\!  
**Maki:** You know we can't ask Yukari-sama to do something like that\.  
**Yume:** Ehhh, but you'll never know until we try asking\!  
**Maki:** And anyway\.\.\. Can they really recreate the story all the way to India\?  
**Suzuka:** I haven't checked, but wouldn't it be like Ban-san to have gone into that much detail\?  
**Yume:** Yeah, I'm getting excited for next time\~\!
