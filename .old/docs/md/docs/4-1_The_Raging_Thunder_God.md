## 1: Uncontrollable (1\)
Night, at Kashima Shrine\. Etou Kanami has finally reached her destination\. However, Juujou Hiyori--

  
**Hiyori:** Kanami\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\! Why are you\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** This was likely Ichikishimahime's will\. She wished to be absorbed by Juujou rather than Tagitsuhime\. And, in doing so, Juujou has obtained the strength to repel Tagitsuhime\.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\.\.\.\? We can talk everything over later\. Let's just go back to the others, okay\?  
**Hiyori:** Stay back\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** Kanami, don't\!\!  
**Kanami:** Ah\.\.\.\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Please\.\.\. stay away\.  
**Kanami:** Why\?  
**Hiyori:** Right now\.\.\. In an instant\.\.\. I saw myself cutting you apart\.\.\. Again and again\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** What\.\.\.\?  
**Yukari:** The future sight given by the dragon's eye\. Ichikishimahime within you is showing you predictions of possible futures\.  
**Hiyori:** Grgh\.\.\. Aghh\.\.\.\!  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan, is it hurting you\?  
**Hiyori:** GH, GHHAAGGHHHH---\!\!  
**Mihono:** She's coming\! Get ready, Kanami\!\!  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\!  

## 2: Uncontrollable (2\)
**Kanami:** Are you okay, Hiyori-chan\!\?  
**Hiyori:** Rrgh\.\.\.\! Urghhh\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** GYAAAAAAGH---\!\!  
**Mihono:** She's gone\!\?  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\!  
**Yukari:** Don't give chase\! Etou, Asakura\. The two of you will go back and report this to Sana\. And prepare for Tagitsuhime's next attack\.  
**Kanami:** But, Hiyori-chan's\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** I'll go\. If you went, you wouldn't be able to do anything for her\.  
**Yukari:** What Juujou needs now is an understanding of how to control the aradama\. I can give her that\.  
**Yukari:** Am I clear\?  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Yes ma'am\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Kanami\.\.\.  

## 3: Panicked Feelings, Worsening Feelings
The night turns into morning\. At a temporary outpost constructed near Kashima's industrial district--

  
**Sana:** You should all get some rest\.  
**Kanami:** I feel fine\. Please, send me out to help look for Hiyori-chan\!  
**Sana:** Not a chance\. Take a break so you can stay in peak condition\. You girls are indispensable to us\.  
**Kanami:** Tagitsuhime will target Hiyori-chan now that she's fused with Ichikishimahime\! I have to protect her\!  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan\.\.\.  
**Sana:** You think you're the only one capable of doing that\?  
**Kanami:** That's not what I meant\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** This isn't like you, Kanamin\. Let's just rest for now, so you can calm down some\.  
**Kaoru:** Yep\. You've gotta recover before a boss fight\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Sana:** You can count on us for finding Juujou\. The bureau director went after her too, didn't she\?  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.She did\.  
**Sana:** So, right now, you need a break\. That's an order\.  
**Kaoru:** Right\.\.\. Oh yeah\. Ex-elite guard\. We owe you for helping to look for Hiyori\.  
**Kaoru:** But, don't think that means you're off the hook for what you did to Mokusa\. Especially you, shorty\.  
**Yume:** It's not like you're any taller than me, you know\.  
**Ellen:** Please don't forget there are still people from Mokusa who haven't forgiven you, Yumecchi\.  
**Yume:** \.\.\.I don't really care if they forgive me anyway\.  
**Sana:** Could you cut that out\? You're supposed to be resting, so don't go doing anything to get in the way of it\. I'm leaving things to you, Yanase\.  
**Mai:** Yes ma'am\.  
**Maki:** Director\?  
**Sana:** You three rest too\. The situation as it is, I'll need to rely on you as well\.  
**Maki:** Is there still no sign of Yomi\?  
**Sana:** I haven't heard any reports as of now\.  
**Suzuka:** Even Yomi-san couldn't be in good shape with those wounds\.  
**Sana:** Satsuki Yomi had been injected with an unusual amount of aradama\. I'd like to save her if we can, but\.\.\. It would be best to think of her as under Tagitsuhime's control now\.  
**Suzuka:** No, we cannot say that for sure\. She seemed\.\.\. to be acting under some great conviction of her own\.  
**Suzuka:** It wasn't given to her by anyone else\. I can only imagine it as Yomi-san's own will\.  
**Sana:** Then why has she been fighting for all this time\?  
**Suzuka:** That's not clear yet\.\.\.  
**Yume:** You don't have to worry\. I'll beat Tagitsuhime\! And I'll save Yomi-onee-san\!  
**Maki:** I'm glad we can count on you\.  
**Yume:** The elite guard is all four of us together\! We can't just leave Yomi-onee-san out\!  
**Maki:** Right, we won't\. That's the spirit, Yume\.  

## 4: What Happens Now (1\)
Meanwhile, with the investigation team, the members of [YOUR NAME HERE\] were--

  
**Kiyoka:** What exactly should we be doing from now on\?  
**Mirja:** That's a good question\. Let's share what we know and put our situation in order\.  
**Mirja:** Currently, the STT and JSDF are giving all their efforts to locate the missing Juujou Hiyori and Origami Yukari\.  
**Chie:** Juujou-san fused with Ichikishimahime to defeat Tagitsuhime, didn't she\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\. It was crazy\.\.\. I couldn't believe how strong she got\. She was moving so fast my eyes couldn't keep up at all\.  
**Mihono:** If Kanami and Yukari-sama weren't there, I'd\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** She's good enough already, and now she's combined with the great aradama\.\.\. I wish I'd been there to see it\.  
**Chie:** Still, while I'm worried about Juujou-san, we need to search for an okatana capable of defeating the great aradama, don't we\.  
**Mirja:** Setouchi Chie is correct\. That was the original objective of this investigation team\. We cannot disregard it now\.  
**Kofuki:** But still\. You really think something that convenient would just have one or two more lying around\?  
**Kiyoka:** We went through a lot just finding Namu Yakushi Kagemitsu\.  
**Chie:** We don't even know if there are more of them, so you're right, it's a bit like trying to catch lightning in a bottle\.  
**Mirja:** Does an okatana capable of suppressing the great aradama still exist\? In our situation, we need to start by finding proof of it\.  
**Mirja:** Although, whatever action we now take will depend on the decisions of our superiors\. We simply need to carry out whatever orders they assign us\.  
**Kofuki:** Well, I'm fine with anything so long as I get to have some fun with aradama-chan\.  
**Mirja:** Setouchi Chie\. We will very likely be cooperating with the elite guard in the future\. Will that be alright\?  
**Chie:** You don't have to worry about me\. I understand just how capable Tsubakuro-san is\. And how much we need her\. So long as it's for our mission, I know we have to work with her\.  
**Mirja:** I see\.  
**Mihono:** We've gotta save Yui and Hana too\! Even if our mission is important too\!  
**Mirja:** It goes without saying, they won't be forgotten\. Rescuing them is a priority of mine as well\. If a chance arises, we won't let it pass\.  
**Chie:** The problem is whether or not we can undo their brainwashing\.  
**Kiyoka:** It seemed like it had a strong hold over them\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** We don't have to worry about that till after we catch 'em\.  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! After we get them back, I'm sure we can figure something out\! Where there's a will, there's a way\!  
**Mirja:** Now then, until orders arrive, each of you wait on standby\. Be sure to get all the rest you need\.  
**Mirja:** However, the continued suppression of aradama is a part of our duties as well\. It's possible we may be suddenly called to action, so please do not relax your guard\.  
**Yuzuki:** Kitora, do you have a moment\?  
**Mirja:** Of course, what do you need\?  
**Yuzuki:** Take this with you\.  
**Mirja:** An ampoule\? What is--  
**Announcement:** Aradama have appeared in the area\. Toji should move to intercept at once\. I repeat--  
**Mirja:** Please excuse me\. Our conversation will have to be put on hold to suppress these aradama\.  
**Yuzuki:** Right\. Best of luck\.  

## 5: What Happens Now (2\)
**Kofuki:** What, that's all of them already\? I was thinking I'd get to have way more fun here\!  
**Chie:** You sure are full of energy, Kofuki-chan\. This sudden mission has me feeling bushed\.  
**Kiyoka:** I-I feel the same\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Mission accomplished\. Everyone, withdraw at once\.  
**Mihono:** C'mon, let's head back\! And when we get there, we've gotta eat a big breakfast\!  
**Mirja:** The ampoule that President Souraku gave me\. I was unable to ask her what it was for\.  
**Mirja:** President Souraku is very busy as well\. Hopefully I can find a chance to speak with her again\.\.\.  

## 6: Emotions with No Outlet (1\)
**Hiyori:** Haa\.\.\. Haah\.\.\.\.\.\. Grh\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Origami\.\.\. Yukari\.\.\.\!  
**Yukari:** Are you suffering\?  
**Hiyori:** Isn't it ironic\.\.\. You used to be possessed by the great aradama\.\.\. And I was the one trying to kill you\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Now, I'm the aradama\.  
**Yukari:** Now that it's come to this, Juujou, you must destroy Tagitsuhime\.  
**Hiyori:** That's what\.\.\. I always planned on doing\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Stop\! Don't take another step towards me\!  
**Yukari:** How many times did you kill me in your future sight just now\? Across various exchanges, you must have cut me down in every possible way\.  
**Hiyori:** Ggh\.\.\.\!  
**Yukari:** Though, I doubt even that would clear away the hatred you bear toward me\.  
**Hiyori:** Urgh\.\.\. AGHHHGGHHH\!\!  

## 7: Emotions with No Outlet (2\)
**Hiyori:** Khgh\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** Don't be swallowed up in the aradama\! Hold firmly onto yourself\!  
**Hiyori:** Ah-\!  
**Yukari:** Listen, Juujou Hiyori\. You have inherited the power of the Hiiragi family from Kagari\. It is the very same power that we, the Origami family, have\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.What are you talking about\?  
**Yukari:** The Origamis suppress the aradama\. Your family, the Hiiragis, are the ones who exorcise them\. The relationship between us could be considered two sides of the same coin\.  
**Hiyori:** What\.\.\.\!\?  
**Yukari:** Even among toji, we are the families closest to special aradama\. It was this power that allowed you to fuse with Ichikishimahime\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Then, why\!\? If we're the same, why was it only a Hiiragi\.\.\. Why did my mother have to give her life, instead of an Origami, to suppress an aradama\!\?  
**Hiyori:** How can I accept something that unreasonable\!\?  
**Hiyori:** And still\.\.\. Damn it\.\.\.\! Because of Ichikishimahime, I know\!  
**Hiyori:** You truly wanted to free my mother from that unreasonable duty\! To save our mothers, you offered yourself to Tagitsuhime--  
**Hiyori:** But then what\!\?  
**Hiyori:** If nobody's to blame, what do I do\!\? With this anger in me\.\.\. With my mother's regret\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** Destroy Tagitsuhime\. After she is defeated, absorb her into yourself and become an evil god\.  
**Hiyori:** Become\.\.\. an evil god\.\.\.\?  
**Yukari:** Do that, and I will bring an end to everything\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  

## 8: Master's Words
**Kanami:** [snooze\]\.\.\.  
**Sayaka:** Kanami fell asleep right away\.\.\.  
**Mai:** She must have been exhausted after all\.  
**Kanami:** [snooze\]\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mai:** But, from the look on her sleeping face, she must be enjoying herself\. Like she's having a nice dream\.  
**Kanami:** Owww\.\.\.  
**Minato:** Okay\. That makes 7 to 3; it's my win\!  
**Kanami:** Ahaha\.\.\. You sure are strong, Master\.  
**Minato:** But you're pretty good yourself, Kanami\. You managed to get 3 points against me\.  
**Minato:** \.\.\.So\? What's bugging you this time\?  
**Kanami:** Eh\.\.\.\?  
**Minato:** Hmm, Hiyori-chan fused with an aradama\?  
**Kanami:** Mm\.\.\. I was right with her, but I couldn't stop it\. She'd been acting a little weird since before the mission\.  
**Kanami:** I'm sure she was thinking, as things kept getting worse, she had to do something\.\.\.  
**Minato:** Well, what's done is done\. You can't blame yourself\.  
**Minato:** You sure are kind, Kanami\. You're kind, and you care about your friends\. But you're cold and self-centered\.  
**Kanami:** Don't those contradict each other\?  
**Kanami:** They do\. But, isn't the world of swordfighting like that\?  
**Kanami:** It is\.\.\.\.\.\.\?  
**Minato:** When you use a sword, you want to be stronger; to master it\.  
**Minato:** But, you defeat opponent after opponent, and after you've beaten everyone, you find yourself all alone\.  
**Minato:** Swordfighting doesn't work without an opponent, after all\.  
**Minato:** Right now, you've gotten strong, Kanami\. Strong enough that nobody on that side can be your opponent anymore\. That's why you're always looking lonely\.  
**Minato:** But it's fine to feel that way\. You should have those kinds of worries\.  
**Minato:** When you're holding something dangerous like an okatana, you have to be thinking about stuff like that\.  
**Kanami:** Okay\.\.\.  
**Minato:** What matters most is how you're kind and care about your friends\. No doubt about it, you're a good kid, Kanami\. Your parents must've been amazing people\.  
**Kanami:** Isn't that you\?  
**Minato:** I- keep- telling- you-, that's not who I am\. If anything, that'd be\.\.\. the future me\?  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Yeah\. She was an amazing mom\.  
**Minato:** I bet\. I mean, she's me and all\.  
**Kanami:** When you're like that, you're just like her\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.That's weird\? I feel all full of energy now\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Alright-\! I'm gonna bring Hiyori-chan back, no matter what\!  
**Sana:** I see you're all here\.  
**Kanami:** What about Hiyori-chan\!\? Have you found where she is\?  
**Sana:** I still haven't gotten anything back from the search team\. You'll all be forming a unit yourselves and taking up the search\. Yanase will be in charge\.  
**Mai:** Yes ma'am\.  
**Ellen:** With the way Hiyoyon is now, our spectrum finders or even Nene could track her down\.  
**Nene:** Nene-\!  
**Kaoru:** So then, let's get going\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Just wait for us, Hiyori-chan\!  

## 9: Hiyori Search Order (1\)
**Mirja:** Director Maniwa, you called for us\?  
**Sana:** Right, I have new orders for you\. Your investigation team will also be joining the search for Juujou Hiyori, whose whereabouts are currently unknown\.  
**Mirja:** Understood\.  
**Mihono:** That's great\! I'm worried about Yui and Hana, but Juujou-san is in trouble too\. We can't leave her alone now\!  
**Kofuki:** We might get to run into her now that she's combined with the great aradama\. I can't wait to see that\!  
**Chie:** Kofuki-chan\.\.\.\?  
**Kofuki:** I-I got it, okay\! It's just a search mission\! I'm not gonna do anything to screw it up\!  
**Kiyoka:** Really\.\.\.\? When it comes to aradama, you start acting funny\. I'm a little concerned\.  
**Kofuki:** I said it'll be fine\! Have a little faith\.\.\. C'mon\.  
**Sana:** The elite guard, along with Kanami the others, are also out looking for Juujou\. If you need to, work together to carry out your mission\.  
**Mirja:** Yes ma'am\!  
**Sana:** Now then, the investigation team--  
**Sana:** What was that\?  
**Announcement:** Aradama have appeared in the area\. Toji should move to intercept at once\. I repeat--  
**Sana:** Figures\. Sorry, but could you girls take care of the aradama around here first\?  
**Kofuki:** Like you have to ask\. No way I'm not going\. Nobody's taking my aradama-chan\.  
**Sana:** As soon as you're done suppressing them, move straight into searching for Juujou\. There's no need for you to return here\.  
**Mirja:** Understood\. We will now proceed to suppress the aradama\!  
**Kofuki:** Hell yeah\! Wait for me, my sweet aradama-chan\!  
**Sana:** If only Kaoru could show some of that enthusiasm\.\.\.  

## 10: Hiyori Search Order (2\)
**Mihono:** Okaaay\! Suppression's taken care of\!  
**Kofuki:** But this is where the real action starts, yeah\?  
**Mirja:** Juujou Hiyori in her current state is capable of defeating Tagitsuhime\. We need to secure her as quickly as possible\.  
**Chie:** That's right\. I doubt Tagitsuhime will leave Juujou-san alone either, so we have to find her before it's too late\.  
**Kiyoka:** Mmhm\. Let's hurry, everyone\!  

## 11: God of Evil (1\)
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** \.\.\.Good\. It may be difficult, but you seem to be able to control it\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.Ggh\!  
**Yukari:** So she came\.\.\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** Now then\.\.\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** Let the final battle begin\.  
**Mai:** You know, earlier\.  
**Kanami:** Huh\?  
**Mai:** I spoke to President Hashima\.  
**Mai:** She said, looking at you and Hiyori-chan, you reminded her of your mothers\.\.\. Of Minato-san and Kagari-san\.  
**Kanami:** My mom\? Oh, right, though I'm not really sure about myself\. I wonder if Hiyori-chan is a lot like her mom then\.  
**Mai:** I think it's true\. The president was always by their side, watching them\.  
**Kanami:** That's right, she was my mom's classmate, wasn't she--  
**Kanami:** It's getting a reaction\! And it's a big one\! It has to be Hiyori-chan\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** Well now\.\.\. Not only clad in lightning, but the speed and weight of your strikes has dramatically grown\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** Merging with her may have considerably raised your potential\.\.\. But surely you don't think that enough to defeat me\?  
**Tagitsuhime:** All you have done is gained Ichikishimahime's power\. While I, by absorbing Takirihime, have greatly amplified my own\.  
**Yukari:** Don't be fooled, Juujou\! Right now, you're stronger than Tagitsuhime\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** Pure nonsense\.  
**Yukari:** When two aradama combine, it's nothing more than simple addition\. She doesn't have nearly as much noro as she did half a year ago\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** You cast off husk\.\.\. The most you can do is bark away from the side\.  
**Yukari:** But the fusion of toji and aradama gives a multiplicative return\. A form of scientific reaction occurs\.  
**Yukari:** And what's more, Juujou\. You have the unique properties inherited from your mother\. Tagitsuhime fears you\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** Are you aware I am a god\?  
**Yukari:** An evil god\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** A god is immortal\.  
**Yukari:** Conceptually, a god may be immortal\. But what you are is nothing more than an aradama imitating life\.  
**Yukari:** Cut down and exorcise the aradama, Juujou\!  
**Hiyori:** HAAAAAAAAHHH-\!\!  

## 12: God of Evil (2\)
**Tagitsuhime:** I see, you are fast\. However\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** Pant\.\.\. Pant\.\.\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** With that much power\.\.\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** It must be a strain on your body\.  
**Hiyori:** Grgh\.\.\.\!  
**Yukari:** The dragon's eye's future sight\. With both of them reading each other's moves through it, the fight stays a draw\.  
**Yukari:** Put all your strength into your attacks\!\!  
**Hiyori:** UAAAAAARGH\!\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** Grh\.\.\. You\.\.\.\!\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** Urgh\.\.\.\!  
**Yukari:** The blade of Kogarasumaru is fatal\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** Yukari, damn you\.\.\. I ignored you for the husk you are, but now you are an eyesore\.\.\. Die\!  
**Yukari:** Heh\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** You could still use utsushi\!\?  
**Hiyori:** HAAAAAAA-\!\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** Ghah\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\!  
**Yukari:** Excellent, Juujou\. That is the form of coexistence between mankind and aradama that Ichikishimahime envisioned\.  
**Yukari:** You are the embodiment of it\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.What's going on\?  
**Yukari:** Juujou\.\.\. Has defeated Tagitsuhime\.  
**Kanami:** What\.\.\.\?  
**Yukari:** And\.\.\. By taking them all into her body\.\.\. Juujou--  
**Yukari:** Has become an evil god\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\!  
**Sayaka:** What is\.\.\. this feeling\?  
**Kaoru:** Yeah, something's not right\.  
**Mai:** Is that\.\.\. Hiyori-chan\?  
**Ellen:** Kanamin\! Be careful\!  
**Hiyori:** Kanami\.\.\.  

## 13: Your Feelings Piling Up (1\)
At that time, with the investigation team--

  
**Kiyoka:** The spectrum finder isn't detecting anything\.  
**Kofuki:** Damnit, where'd Hiyori even run off to\?  
**Mirja:** The readings from Juujou Hiyori after fusing with Ichikishimahime should be incomparable to that of a standard aradama\.  
**Mirja:** For it to be unable to detect her could only mean we aren't within enough range\.  
**Kofuki:** For real, how much longer are we gonna have to walk\? Especially out here on this mountain\.  
**Kofuki:** Wait, do we even know she's still around here\? Couldn't she have gone off somewhere else already\?  
**Chie:** We can't rule that out, but with no other information, we'll just have to continue searching by foot\.  
**Kofuki:** So that's what it comes down to\.  
**Kiyoka:** But, thinking about how Juujou-san must feel, we have to find her soon\.\.\.  
**Kofuki:** Huhh\? Why Hiyori instead of Kanami\?  
**Kiyoka:** It must be hard enough on her after fusing with Ichikishimahime, but they said she can't control it\.  
**Kiyoka:** Wouldn't it be scary if you didn't know if you would hurt your friends\? Wouldn't it feel hopeless for your own strength to be out of your control\? Wouldn't you be crushed under your own fears\?  
**Kiyoka:** You don't want to hurt anyone, but you want someone there with you\. If it were me, I know that's how I'd feel\. That's why, we have to find Juujou-san quickly\.  
**Chie:** Kiyoka-chan\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Don't worry, I know we'll find her right away\! I can feel it\. We're almost there\! Just trust my intuition\!  
**Kiyoka:** Something showed up on the spectrum finder\! It's headed this way\.  
**Mihono:** See\~, look\. My intuition was right on the money\!  
**Aradama:** SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Mihono:** Wait\.\.\. That's not Juujou-san\!  
**Kofuki:** Your intuition's gonna go bankrupt at this rate\!  
**Chie:** And this had to be right when we're in a hurry\.  
**Kofuki:** They came all the way to see us\. We've gotta roll out the red carpet\. You're welcome anytime, aradama-chan\!  
**Mirja:** Everyone, ready for combat\!  

## 14: Your Feelings Piling Up (2\)
**Chie:** That should be all of them\.  
**Mihono:** Then, let's get our heads back in the search for Juujou-san\!  
**Mirja:** Wait\! This call is from headquarters\. Everyone, remain on standby\.  
**Mirja:** This is Kitora\. Yes, yes\.\.\. Yes, I understand\. We will convene with them at once\.  
**Kofuki:** What'd they say\?  
**Mirja:** It appears they have found Juujou Hiyori\. We'll head to the scene immediately\!  
**Kiyoka:** They found Juujou-san\? Thank goodness\.\.\.  

## 15: Where the Tournament Left Off (1\)
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Hiyori-chan\?  
**Yukari:** Can you hold onto yourself, Juujou\.\.\.\? If you can shut them out, this will all be over\.  
**Yukari:** If you can't\.\.\. Then we will go together to the depths of the netherworld\.  
**Kanami:** Yukari-sama\!  
**Hiyori:** That's not bad either\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Hiyori-chan\!  
**Hiyori:** I get it\.\.\. That's what you meant, when you said you'd end everything\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** You and I are two sides of a coin\. Only our sides are flipped this time, aren't they\?  
**Hiyori:** This time, you're going to throw your life away and fall into the depths of the netherworld with me\?  
**Yukari:** If you can suppress it, that won't be necessary\. But I know full well how difficult that can be\.  
**Yukari:** Twenty years was all I could manage to contain it for\. Maybe it could be different for you\.  
**Hiyori:** Twenty years, like this\.\.\.\? I don't think that's possible for me\.  
**Yukari:** Is that so\.  
**Hiyori:** But, I don't need help from you\. I can go myself\.\.\.  
**Mai:** Hiyori-chan\!  
**Ellen:** Hiyoyon\?  
**Sayaka:** Let's go back\.\.\. Hiyori\.  
**Kaoru:** Oi\. I know I'm asking the impossible, but try to deal with it\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.I feel like I could burst at any moment\. And if I let this out\.\.\. a disaster like twenty years ago\.\.\. no, worse could--  
**Kanami:** Hey\.\.\. Are you strong now, Hiyori-chan\?  
**Mai:** Kanami-chan\.\.\.\?  
**Kanami:** You are, aren't you\? After all, you were strong enough to beat Tagitsuhime\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Hey, do you think, right now, we could pick up where we left off at the tournament\?  
**Kaoru:** Are you out of your mind\?  
**Ellen:** Kanamin, there's a limit--  
**Kanami:** I guess my timing's pretty bad, huh\? But I feel like this is the only chance I'll get to face off with Hiyori-chan while she's this strong\.  
**Hiyori:** Kanami\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** I mean\.\.\. You're not going to be with us anymore, right\?  
**Ellen:** Kanamin\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.To tell you the truth\?  
**Kanami:** I've gotten a lot stronger since then\. I felt like, if I went all out, I could have wiped the floor with you\.  
**Hiyori:** You're saying, now that I've become an evil god, we're finally equals\?  
**Kanami:** Well, I don't know about that\?  
**Ellen:** Kanamin\! That's enough\! You're seriously making me angry\!  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.I'll get to see you going all out, won't I\?  
**Kanami:** Yeah\. I'll give you everything I've got\.  
**Ellen:** H-Hold on a minute\! This is crazy, you two\!  
**Hiyori:** That's how she's always been\. Kind on one side, but--  
**Kanami:** Cold and self-centered\?  
**Hiyori:** That's right\.  
**Kanami:** (Wait\.\.\.\? Was it Hiyori-chan who told me that\?\)  
**Hiyori:** Don't go thinking this is unfair\.  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.I won't\. Using that is just one of your talents\. It's just a different tactic than mine\.  
**Hiyori:** \.\.\.That's impossible\!\?  
**Hiyori:** Against Kanami putting all her strength into her sword, I lose in every instance\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** From seeing it with the dragon's eye, I finally understand\. Etou's sword accurately reads the three powers of heaven, earth, and man, and instantly forms a fight in response\.  
**Yukari:** That part of her began blooming that night in Kamakura, and now, it's showing its full potential\.  
**Hiyori:** This is\.\.\.  
**Yukari:** For Etou, this may be her \"single sword\"\.  
**Hiyori:** HAH-\!  

## 16: Where the Tournament Left Off (2\)
**Hiyori:** HAAAAAAAHH\!\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mai:** She cut\.\.\.  
**Kaoru:** Straight through the lightning\.\.\.  
**Hiyori:** I don't believe it\.\.\. Even with the power of an evil god\.\.\.  
**Kanami:** Hmm\? So you're just going to give up that easily, and get sent to the depths of the netherworld with the aradama\?  
**Hiyori:** Kanami\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\?  
**Kanami:** I won't let you\.\.\.\! I'll never\.\.\.\! Let that happen\.\.\.\!  
**Kanami:** If you can't hold it in by yourself, then just let it all out\! I'll cut it down for you\!  
**Kanami:** Every last bit of it-- I'll cut it all down\!  
**Kanami:** Didn't I tell you I'd take half of it too\.\.\.\? Please, just trust me more\.\.\.\!  
**Kanami:** [sobbing\]  
**Hiyori:** Grgh\!\! Ah\.\.\. GUAGH\.\.\.\!\!  
**Hiyori:** AAGGGHHHH\!\!\!  
**Mai:** Tagitsuhime\!\? Why\.\.\.\?  
**Tagitsuhime:** You weren't the only one scheming something\.\.\. Yukari\!  
**Hiyori:** Gagh\.\.\.\!  
**Tagitsuhime:** Now, become one with me\.  
**Tagitsuhime:** Heh\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Hiyoyon was absorbed into Tagitsuhime\.\.\.  
**Nene:** Ne-\!  
**Kanami:** \.\.\.Hiyori\.\.\.chan\.\.\.\?  
**Other:** Guided by the Lightning  
**Kofuki:** When they said they found Hiyori, this was the way we were supposed to head, right\?  
**Mirja:** I have GPS confirmation of it\. She's in this direction, without a doubt\. It shouldn't be much further either\.  
**Kiyoka:** The spectrum finder is showing a big reaction too\!  
**Chie:** Hya-\!\? Wh-What was that\.\.\.\? Was that a lightning strike, right nearby\.\.\.\?  
**Kiyoka:** That lightning strike\.\.\. It's in the same direction the spectrum finder is showing\!  
**Mihono:** That lightning\.\.\. I know what that is\! That's Juujou-san\.\.\.\! Just like back then\!  
**Mihono:** Let's hurry, guys\! We're almost there\!
