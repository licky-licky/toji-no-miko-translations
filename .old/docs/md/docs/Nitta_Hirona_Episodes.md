## 1: The Type I'm No Good With
**Mimi:** Hirona-onee-san\! Come play with Mimi-\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Sigh, this again\. [muttered\]  
**Mimi:** Huh\? Maybe she didn't hear me\? Are your ears feeling stuffed up\? Hey, Hirona-onee-san\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I can hear youuu\.  
**Mimi:** I'm glad you can hear me then\!  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Sigh\. Because of Kagami-san, I haven't been able to do things according to plan lately\.\)  
**Mimi:** Hey hey hey hey\! Come play with Mimi, Hirona-onee-san\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** (Why exactly is she so attached to me\.\.\. It's not like I did anything with her\.\.\. Hmm\.\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I have an aradama suppression mission today, so we can't play\.  
**Mimi:** Really\? That's too bad\.\.\.  
**Mimi:** Then, when'll we get to play, Hirona-onee-san\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.It's hard to sayyy\.  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.Though, I don't think that day is ever cominggg\.\)  
**Mimi:** Hirona-onee-san, let's make sure to play tomorrow\!  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.She's even doing this in the dormmms\?\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Kagami-san, do you not have friends\?  
**Mimi:** Huh\? I do\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Then I think it would be better if you left me alone and played with them\.  
**Mimi:** You're my friend too, Hirona-onee-san, so it's all alright\!  
**Mimi:** And anyway, you can just call me Mimi, Hirona-onee-san\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.No thank youuu\.  
**Mimi:** Why not\!\?  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.Because if I'm looking after you, my efficiency will go down\.\)  
**Hirona:** (I don't want to get any less efficient\.\.\. I'll alter my routine tomorrow so I won't run into Kagami-san\.\)  
**Hirona:** Yawn\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** I might have woken up too early after allll\.  
**Mimi:** But it feels great waking up early, doesn't it\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Do you normally eat breakfast at this time, Kagami-san\?  
**Mimi:** Nope\.  
**Mimi:** I just had a feeling you'd be here right now, Hirona-onee-san\!  
**Hirona:** Ugh\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** (Is it on instinnnct\.\.\.\? I have a sort of bad feeling about this\.\.\.\)  
**Mimi:** Fooound you, Hirona-onee-san\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Kagami-san, your voice is too loud\.  
**Hirona:** (I thought that I wouldn't see her if I adjusted my time in the library\.\.\.\)  
**Hirona:** Why did you think I would be here\?  
**Mimi:** When you weren't in the classroom, I just looked everywhere around school\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Didn't you think I could have gone home early\?  
**Mimi:** Nope\! Cause, you're Hirona-onee-san after all\!  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.That's not a reasonnn\.\)  
**Hirona:** (Still\.\.\. Kagami-san's impulsiveness is completely outside my ability to plan around\.\)  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.Instead of being indirect, it might be faster to to say it straight here\.\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Kagami-san\. Please don't come up to me anymore\. You're bothering me\.  
**Mimi:** Yeah, I hear that a lot\! Like, Mimi, you're a little troublemaker\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Didn't I say you were bothering me\?  
**Mimi:** But, I still like you, Hirona-onee-san, so I'm gonna come see you\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** (Calling it \"innocence\" sounds better, but\.\.\. this girl just doesn't listen to people\.\.\.\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Sigh\. Fine then, do what you want\.  
**Mimi:** You mean it\!\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Trying to get rid of you was less efficient\.  
**Mimi:** Hooray\! Then, starting today, call me Mimi\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.No thank youuu\.  

## 2: The Four of Us Shopping
On a day off\.\.\.

  
**Kiyoka:** Our goal today is\.\.\. to pick out clothes for Nitta-san\!  
**Mihono/Yui:** Yeah-\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Yeah-\.  
**Mihono:** What kind of clothes do you think would look good on Hirona\?  
**Kiyoka:** I get the feeling anything would work on her\. She could wear something cool or something cute just fine\.  
**Yui:** The more lightly dressed the better\!  
**Kiyoka:** That's rejected\.  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Awww\.  
**Mihono:** Ahaha\!  
**Mihono:** Hmm, which would look good on Hirona\.\.\. Ah, I bet Kohime'd like this one\!  
**Mihono:** I'm going to go buy it real quick\!  
**Yui:** You're totally in love with Kohime-chan, aren't you, Mihono-chan\! It's so precious it hurts though\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.It sure is\.  
**Mihono:** I'm back-\. Okay, so what should we do\?  
**Kiyoka:** I want to have a short strategy meeting first, so how about we find something to eat\?  
**Yui:** Like crepes\?  
**Kiyoka:** Crepes\.\.\.  
**Yui:** What's wrong, Kiyoka-chan\?  
**Kiyoka:** I've been a little worried about my waistline recently\.\.\. You know, it'll be summer soon, and then\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ahh, cause of swimsuits\.  
**Yui:** But I'd still like you if your belly's a little soft, Kiyoka-chan\.  
**Kiyoka:** I don't care if you'd like it\.\.\.  
**Yui:** That's so mean\!\? But I like that too\!\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Ah, sorry, Hirona\! We sort of got off-topic, didn't we\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.No, it's fun just listening to you three talk\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Is it though\?  
**Hirona:** It is\.  
**Mihono:** (Still, we came to hang out with the four of us, so I want Hirona to be having a good time too\.\)  
**Mihono:** (Okay, I'll come up with something for Hirona to talk about\!\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Ah, Musumi-san\. I really like that outfit thereee\.  
**Kiyoka:** Oh, it's so cute\. I think I like it a lot too\.  
**Yui:** You two should try it on\! I'll be waiting for you\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.But you're planning on peeping, aren't youuu\?  
**Yui:** She found me out\!\?  
**Mihono:** Wait, huh\!\? Hirona naturally worked her way into the conversation\!\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.What do you take me for\? I know the flow of your conversations, so I can join in\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Actually, Asakura-san, were you thinking of looking out for meee\?  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.You noticed\?  
**Hirona:** It seemed like something you'd dooo\. But changing the flow of the conversation would leave odd pauses, so isn't that less efficient\?  
**Hirona:** That's why I tried joining in now and thennn\.  
**Mihono:** Then you could've just joined in from the start\!\?  
**Hirona:** Sorrrry about that\. Even when I wasn't talking, the conversation was still moving smoothly, sooo\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.Does anybody ever tell you you're strange, Hirona\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.How did you knowww\? For some reason, I get told that sometimes\.  
**Mihono:** No, I think the reason's pretty clear\!  

## 3: My Hero
**Yuuki:** Hirona-san, are you busy later\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.I'm availableee\.  
**Yuuki:** Then, let's make an appointment to go shopping in half an hour\!  
**Hirona:** Okaaay\.  
**Akira:** \.\.\.  
That evening\.\.\.

  
**Akira:** Yo, Hirona\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Oh, Akira-san\. Did you need somethiiing\?  
**Akira:** You go along with whatever Yuuki asks you, don't you\.  
**Hirona:** I do\?  
**Akira:** Yeah\.  
**Akira:** But you're all about efficiency\. And you actually had some plans today, didn't you\?  
**Hirona:** I did, but Yuuki-san took higher priority\.  
**Akira:** Hmm\.  
**Akira:** I never asked, but, did something happen between you and Yuuki\?  
**Hirona:** Something with\.\.\. Yuuki-saaan\?  
**Hitakami Toji 1:** Huh\!\? Nitta-san's in the same unit as us for this mission\!\?  
**Hitakami Toji 2:** Didn't the last unit Nitta-san was part of break up after she stabbed them in the back\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.It's not like I turned on them because I wanted to stab them in the back\.\)  
**Hirona:** (It was just more efficient that way\.\.\. Though I doubt they would listen if I explained that\.\)  
**Hitakami Toji 1:** Hey, Nitta-san\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Yes\?  
**Hitakami Toji 2:** Do you think we could work separate from each other\? So long as we suppress the aradama, it doesn't matter\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Alriiight\. That would be more efficient, wouldn't ittt\.  
**Hitakami Toji 1:** Thanks\.  
**Hirona:** (You don't have to sound so relieved\.\.\. I wouldn't turn on anyone in a normal suppression assignment\.\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Well, I can do this more efficiently on my own thoughhh\.  
**Hirona:** [pant pant\]\.\.\.  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Hirona:** --\! HAAHH\!\!  
**Aradama:** GYOHHHHHHHHHH\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.More of them, againnn\.  
**Hirona:** (This is as hard as you'd expect\.\.\. I wonder how those two are doing\.\.\.\)  
**Aradama:** OOOOOOOOO\!  
**Hirona:** Kgh\!\?  
**Hirona:** [pant pant\]\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** This isn't the time to worry about others, is ittt\.\.  
**Hirona:** (I really won't be able to keep fighting any longer\.\.\. I'd like to find some way of escaping, but\.\.\.\)  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.The problem is, which do I go withhh\.  
**Hirona:** (If I stay here, things will only get worse\.\.\.\)  
**Hirona:** All or nothing\.\.\. Is that what it comes down tooo\. Sigh, how inefficient\.\.\.  
**Aradama:** GUOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.This was a bust, wasn't it\.  
**Aradama:** GAOOOOOOOOOOO\!  
**Hirona:** Grgh\.\.\.\!\?  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Hirona:** (Is this it\.\.\.\!\?\)  
**Yuuki:** HAAAAAAAAAAH\!\!  
**Yuuki:** Are you okay\!\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Yuuki-san\? Why are you here\.\.\.\?  
**Yuuki:** When you were the only one who didn't come back, I asked the other two what happened, and they said you were acting on your own\.  
**Yuuki:** So I came looking for you\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Thank you very much\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.And that's how it happened\.  
**Akira:** Huh, way to go, Yuuki\.  
**Hirona:** (\.\.\.\.\.\.Well, that story should be enough to satisfy Akira-san-\.\)  
**Hirona:** (Though, the truth is I owe her something much harder to repay\.\.\. But that's not something I'd tell anyone\.\)  

## 4: Determination
**Aradama:** GYAOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Toji A:** The aradama are attacking\!\!  
**Toji B:** Why're there so many aradama\!\? Wasn't this just a noro retrieval mission\!\?  
**Toji A:** Worry about that later\! We're pushing them back\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Toji C:** Nitta-san\! Quit spacing out and draw your okatana\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Understoood\.  
**Toji:** \.\.\.Get ready, Nitta-san\. Aradama\.\.\. they won't go easy on you cause you're new\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Got it\.  
**Toji A:** Here they come\!  
**Hirona:** Gh\.\.\. Urkh\.\.\.  
**Rescue Party:** There's another toji collapsed over here\!  
**Rescue Party:** Hey, are you okay\!\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.My body hurts\.  
**Rescue Party:** We'll get you to a hospital right away\! Just hang in a little longer\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.What about my senpais\?  
**Rescue Party:** \.\.\.You had the least severe injuries\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.That's not efficient at all\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Being hospitalized suuure is boring\.  
**Miyako:** In that case, mind if I borrow some of your time\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.You're my senpai, aren't you\? Who are youuu\?  
**Miyako:** Sasano Miyako, from the research course\. Good to meet you, Nitta-san\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.It's nice to meet you\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Oh\? Am I wrong, or is your left arm\.\.\.  
**Miyako:** It is\. It happened\.\.\. a long time ago\.  
**Miyako:** Your mission this time, it was difficult for you all, wasn't it\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.It was\.  
**Miyako:** The kind of thing you'd call inefficient, right\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.Yes\. Actually, it's because nothing about that mission was efficient\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Ah\. Does that count as criticizing the head of the Origami family\?  
**Miyako:** Maybe\. I think it'd be best not to say much about that\.  
**Miyako:** Though\.\.\. It was interesting talking to you\. Anyway, I'll see you around\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Goodbye\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.What was that about, anyway\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.After being away from school for so long, I get called right away by the president\. Sasano-san might have reported me\.  
**Hirona:** Excuse me\.  
**Sana:** You're here\.  
**Miyako:** It's been a while\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Sasano-san, did you report meeee\?  
**Miyako:** If I had to say one way or the other, I guess I did\?  
**Miyako:** Though, it's not in a bad way\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Ah, then you aren't mad at me\. In that case, it's alllright\.  
**Sana:** She's a funny one\.  
**Miyako:** I thought you might like her\. \.\.\.What do you think\?  
**Sana:** Sure, I don't see why not\.  
**Sana:** I'm going to get straight to the point\.\.\. Nitta, do you want to join Mokusa\?  
**Hirona:** Mokusa\?  
**Sana:** Mokusa opposes Origami Yukari\.\.\. It's an organization formed to oppose the revisionists led by Origami Yukari, with the intent of restoring okatana and toji to the state they should be\.  
**Sana:** Nobody's going to force you, but\.\.\. You want to change the way things are now too, don't you, Nitta\?  
**Sana:** What do you say\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Alright thennn\.  
**Hirona:** Toji being injured is inefficient, sooo\. If it improves our situation, I'll joiiin\.  
**Sana:** \.\.\.I had a feeling you'd say that\.  
**Sana:** Nitta, there's somebody out there with similar opinions to yours\. Do you want to go meet them now\?  
**Hirona:** With similar opinions to mine\.\.\. I want to meet them\. Could you tell me their name for nowww\?  
**Sana:** Sure\. Her name is\.\.\. Hitakami Makoto\.  

## 5: An Inefficient Method
**Makoto:** Have you finished preparing for your trip to Okinawa\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Yeeep, I'm ready to go-\. I have my summer clothes and swimsuit with meee\.  
**Akira:** Your swimsuit\? You know you're not going there for fun, right\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I know thaaat\.  
**Hirona:** But, I won't know what I'll need, and couldn't the target I'm observing say she wants to go to the beach\?  
**Yuuki:** This great aradama the Sword Administration Bureau is safeguarding\.\.\. Her name was Kohime\? Would great aradamas really be interested in things like going to the beach\?  
**Makoto:** If it were Tagitsuhime, surely she wouldn't\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I think she might because of Asakura-san's influence\. She became attached to Asakura-san\.  
**Akira:** Cause of Mihono then\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Damnit, now that Mihono's started showing those powers, I really don't want to be giving up somebody trustworthy\.  
**Makoto:** This observation mission in Okinawa is also something we could only leave to someone we can trust\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Please leave Okinawa to meee\.  
**Akira:** I get all that, okay\.  
**Akira:** Ahh, fuck it\! Things just can't go our way, can they\!  
**Makoto:** Akira-chan\?  
**Akira:** I'm going for a ride to clear my head\!  
**Makoto:** I suppose that's the end of that\.  
**Yuuki:** What are you going to do now, Makoto-nee-sama\?  
**Makoto:** I'm sure that Akira-chan will be back in time for dinner, so I'll get the food ready\.  
**Makoto:** Hirona-san, you should stay and eat with us today\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Thank you very muuuch\.  
**Hirona:** It's the two of us now\. What will you do, Yuuki-san\?  
**Yuuki:** I'm going to do my secret training\. You should join me, Hirona-san\!  
**Yuuki:** HAAAAAAAAAAH\!\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.  
**Hirona:** (Once I'm in Okinawa\.\.\. I won't be able to join Yuuki-san for a while\.\)  
**Yuuki:** YAAAAAH\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Oh, I lost, didn't I\.  
**Yuuki:** Hirona-san\! Please stay focused\! I have to\.\.\. I have to train to be even stronger\!  
**Yuuki:** Please go another round with me\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Okaaay\.  
**Hirona:** (If Yuuki-san wants to be stronger\.\.\. Becoming a tamayori toji would be the efficient thing to do\.\)  
**Hirona:** (But\.\.\.\)  
**Yuuki:** YAAAAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Hirona:** Nh\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** That was a good strike just now\.  
**Yuuki:** You mean it\!\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I wouldn't want that, would I\.  
**Yuuki:** Hirona-san\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Just talking to myseeelf\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.More importantly, let's go another round, before you forget the feeling of that strike\.  
**Yuuki:** Okay\! If you'll have me\!  
**Hirona:** (It might be inefficient\.\.\. but I think training like this is what's right for Yuuki-san\.\)  

## [Hirona Joins: Start\]: Time For a Contest\!
**Yuuki:** The three of us haven't gone on a mission for a while, have we, Akira-nee-sama, Hirona-san\!  
**Akira:** Yeah, now that you mention it, that's right\.  
**Akira:** It's mostly the same for me, but Hirona's not around a lot\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Were you talking about meee\?  
**Akira:** You seriously move at your own beat, y'know that\?  
**Yuuki:** We were just saying, it's been a while since the three of us were on a mission together\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I think you're right\.  
**Hirona:** But, it's mostly Akira-san's fault that I'm busy, isn't it-\?  
**Akira:** I'm just the one telling you your missions\!  
**Hirona:** Ehh, but there's missions from you too, aren't there\?  
**Akira:** They're not from me, they're from Makocchan\!  
**Yuuki:** That's just proof that they trust you\! And I trust you too, of course\!  
**Akira:** That's how it is\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.It all depends on how you put it\.  
**Hirona:** Well, since Akira-san is here today, I'm going to take it easy\. That'll be most efficient\.  
**Akira:** Quit trying to make things easy just for yourself\!  
**Hirona:** I'd like to save my energy for when it really matteeers\.  
**Akira:** Hahh\!\? Then I'm gonna work you whether you like it or not\!  
**Akira:** Yuuki, Hirona\! We're making this a competition to see who gets the most aradama\! Last place buys dinner\!  
**Yuuki:** We're competing\!\? Bring it on\!		[Yuuki uses Akira's catchphrase\]  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.If Yuuki-san is fine with it, it's okay with me too\.  
**Akira:** No backing out then\!  
**Akira:** I'm not about to let you beat me, Yuuki\! Hirona\!  
**Yuuki:** I won't lose either\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.  
**Akira:** ORAAH\! Onnne\! Twooo\! Threee\!  
**Yuuki:** HAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Hirona:** You two are working very hard\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Then, I'll go at it efficiently too\.  

## [Hirona Joins: End\]: Fighting Efficiently
**Hirona:** \.\.\.The aradama readings sure are going away surprisingly quickly\.  
**Hirona:** Though\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** The biggest reading is this way\.  
**Hirona:** I don't think I'll be able to beat Akira-san in numbers, but I can hunt big game efficiently hereee\.  
**Large Aradama:** OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\!\!  
**Hirona:** That's a big one-\.  
**Hirona:** Then\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** I'll just defeat you-\.  
**Large Aradama:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.  
**Large Aradama:** OOAA\!\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Are you surprised I avoided that\? That slow attack won't hit me\.  
**Large Aradama:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Hirona:** HMPH-\!\!  
**Large Aradama:** GYAAAAAAAAAAAAA\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.That's all there is to it\. Now, I can go back\.  
**Akira:** Huhh\!\? You just got a single one\!\?  
**Hirona:** Yes\. Though, I beat the one that seemed strongest\.  
**Yuuki:** So Hirona-san was big game hunting\!  
**Hirona:** I worked hard efficientlyyy\.  
**Akira:** So you went for quality over quanity\.\.\.\? Damnit, what do we do now\.  
**Yuuki:** Nee-sama had quanity, Hirona-san had quality\.\.\. Either way, I came in last\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Judge, please decide\. Which of us won\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.Sigh\. You're saying that cause you know how I am, aren't ya\?  
**Akira:** No matter how many weak aradama you beat, they're all just the same\!  
**Hirona:** Hooray-\. In that case, you'll buy dinner for Yuuki-san and meee\.  
**Akira:** Hah\!\?  
**Yuuki:** Hirona-san\!\? But I'm the one who came in last\!\?  
**Hirona:** The one who came up with it didn't come in first, so it's the same as coming in last\.  
**Akira:** You've got some real nerve\.\.\. No other way around it\! You two eat whatever you want\! It's on me\!  
**Hirona:** Got iiit\. Fufu, let's have something tasty, Yuuki-san\.  

## [Misogi - Hirona: Start\]: Cooking With No Regard for Efficiency
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Makoto-san, Akira-san\. Could you teach me how to cook\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Huh\?  
**Akira:** You want me teaching you how to cook\? I get why you'd ask Makocchan, but\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.Ah, you're just for taste testing, Akira-saan\. It's more cost-effective asking you from the start\.  
**Akira:** Oh, so that's why\.  
**Makoto:** I wouldn't mind teaching you how to cook, though\.\.\. I thought you didn't have any interest in cooking for yourself, Hirona-san\.\.\.\?  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.That's right, it's a waste of effort to cook for myself\.  
**Hirona:** I think it's much better to have somebody else cook tasty food for me\.  
**Hirona:** But, there's a reason I want to cook a meal myself this time\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** What would that be\?  
**Hirona:** Yuuki-san told me she wanted to try eating food I made\.  
**Akira:** You're real soft when it comes to Yuuki, aren't ya\.  
**Hirona:** My sense of efficiency doesn't apply for Yuuki-san, so I put in all my effort for her\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.That doesn't go for you though, Akira-san\.  
**Akira:** Didn't ask\.  
**Akira:** But hey, didja know Yuuki'll do anything I tell her\? Hmm\? You jealous\?  
**Hirona:** Gununununu\.\.\. I'm extremely jealouss\.  
**Akira:** Ahaha\! I win this one\!  
**Makoto:** That's enough fooling around, you two\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.Yuuki-san does almost anything Makoto-san asks too, doesn't she\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** Ehh\!\?  
**Hirona:** It makes me jealouss\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Look what you did to Hirona, Makocchan\.  
**Makoto:** Ehh\!\? But, I can't make a comeback like Akira-chan can\!\?  
**Makoto:** I'll make sure to teach you cooking, alright\!  
**Akira:** There ya go\.  
**Hirona:** I guess that's fine\.  
**Makoto:** \.\.\.Honestly, don't go teasing me like that, okay\?  
**Hirona:** I meant it seriously when I said I was jealous, so please forgive me\.  
**Hirona:** Ah, but I'll get revenge on Akira-san\. You have to taste test until you get sick\.  
**Akira:** Fine by me, but do me a favor and at least make it edible\.  
**Hirona:** I'll do what I cann\.  

## [Misogi - Hirona: End\]: Greatest Efficiency
**Hirona:** I already knew, but\.\.\. she's skilled with her hands\.  
**Akira:** I mean, Makocchan's been cooking since forever\.  
**Hirona:** It's unusual for Makoto-san to be so good at cooking when she comes from such a wealthy family\.  
**Akira:** What started it was\.\.\. I guess it's kinda like you\. Her mom was real busy, and she wanted her to have something good to eat\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I never did meet the previous head of the Hitakami family\.  
**Akira:** She was really nice\. Back then, Makocchan's cooking sucked too, and\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** What are you two talking about\?  
**Akira:** Just how you used to suck at cooking\.  
**Makoto:** Well of course I wasn't any good at first\.  
**Makoto:** Here, Hirona-san\. I'm finished with my example\. Now you should try doing it yourself\.  
**Hirona:** Okaaay\. I'll tryy\.  
**Makoto:** So, now that I've had you try making it\.\.\.  
**Akira:** Hey, it's good enough, right\? You could serve this just fine\.  
**Makoto:** Yes, I think it's rather good too\. If you can make this, you shouldn't need me teaching you\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** No, this won't work\.  
**Akira:** Huh\? What's the problem\?  
**Hirona:** It doesn't taste the same as Makoto-san's\.  
**Akira:** Well duh, course it doesn't\.  
**Akira:** You started cooking like an hour ago; if you could make it taste the same, what'd that say about Makocchan\? Yuuki just wants to eat your food; this'll be fine\.  
**Hirona:** But, if mine tastes worse than Makoto-san's, couldn't she eat Makoto-san's cooking instead\?  
**Akira:** \.\.\.You can be a real pain in the ass, y'know\.  
**Hirona:** When it comes to Yuuki-san, I ignore the cost-benefits\.  
**Hirona:** What should I do, Makoto-san\?  
**Makoto:** Let's see\.\.\.  
**Makoto:** I know; how about this\?  
**Yuuki:** Just you wait, nee-samas\! We'll get some delicious udon ready for you\! Right, Hirona-san\!  
**Hirona:** I'll do my beeest\.  
**Akira:** Nice thinking, having them cook together\.  
**Makoto:** This way Yuuki-chan will surely be happy\.  
**Yuuki:** Hirona-san, you're not kneading it hard enough\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.I'm not\? Can you show me how\?  
**Yuuki:** You do it\.\.\. like this\!  
**Hirona:** Like\.\.\. this\? You're amazing at this, Yuuki-san\.  
**Yuuki:** Ehehe, thanks\!  
**Hirona:** (It's not exactly my cooking, but\.\.\. it's making Yuuki-san smile, so this is the greatest efficiency\.\)  

Joint Raid Event #10
====================

## 1: First Mission With Hirona
**Mirja:** I'm sure you'll be managing more here, but if anything troubles you, please don't hesitate to let us know, Nitta Hirona\.  
**Hirona:** Thank you\.\.\. for your consideration\. For now, there isn't anything\.\.\. Though, I have some concerns about the special duties of the investigation team\.  
**Mihono:** It'll probably take a little getting used to, but, besides collecting Akabane swords, we do normal toji work\. So you don't have to worry about it too much\.  
**Chie:** And a lot of the time, suppressing aradama is part of collecting Akabane swords, so as long as you stay focused like you would on your normal missions, you won't have any problems\.  
**Hirona:** I see-\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Um\.\.\. Chie-san, it's about time\.  
**Chie:** You're right\. Okay, Mihono-chan\. I'm leaving the rest to you\. We have to hurry and get ready\.  
**Mihono:** Ah, sure\! You can count on me\!  
**Kiyoka:** \.\.\.Make sure she doesn't find out, okay\? (whispered\)  
**Hirona:** \? Is everyone doing something now\?  
**Mihono:** Ah-- Nah, you don't have to worry about it, Nitta-san\! Uhh, yeah\.\.\.\! Cause, you just got here yesterday\!  
**Hirona:** But\.\.\. I am a member of the investigation team too\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** (Wh-What should I say\.\.\. We want to keep it a secret until the last minute, cause it's her welcoming party and all, so there's no way I can let her help them set it up\!\)  
**Mihono:** It's like, uh\.\.\. We don't have a mission\?  
**Mirja:** No, just now, we've received an urgent mission request\.  
**Mihono:** Eh\!\?  
**Kofuki:** Now we're talking; quit wasting time\.  
**Mirja:** We'll go now to suppress the aradama\! --Investigation team, move out\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** Then\.\.\. I'll have to make sure of it first\. (muttered\)  
**Yui:** Hirona-chaaan, are you coming-\?  
**Hirona:** Sorryy\.\.\. I'll be right theere\.  
**Mihono:** Kiyoka, can you finish it off\!  
**Kiyoka:** Okay\! There--\!  
**Mirja:** Musumi Kiyoka, continue providing cover for Yamashiro Yui and the others\. Asakura Mihono and Nitta Hirona will support Shichinosato Kofuki\. Shichinosato Kofuki\! Don't push too far ahead; wait for those two before attacking\!  
**Kofuki:** I can handle this much on my own\! Mihocchi's one thing, but this newbie's slow as hell\.\.\. Like I'd wait for her\!  
**Mihono:** You always come out and say that stuff, Fukki\! It's rude\! Don't let it get to you, Nitta-san--  
**Aradama:** GGGGIIIiii\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** \.\.\.\!\? --WATCH OUT\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\!  
**Aradama:** GGGGIIIiii\!  

## 2: The Investigation Team's New Asset
**Mihono:** I'm not letting you hurt her--\! HAAAAAAAHH\!\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** Are you okay\!\? Hirona\!  
**Mirja:** Nitta Hirona, can you continue fighting on this mission\?  
**Hirona:** Yes\.\.\. That's not an issue\. It seems I had some\.\.\. unusual nervousness, but I can do it\.  
**Aradama:** GGGGIIIiii\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.HAAH\!  
**Aradama:** \.\.\.\.\.\.  
**Mirja:** Beautifully done\. I see\.\.\. So your okatana can be used for more than simply thrusting\. This expands our available tactics\.  
**Hirona:** Right\.\.\. So, please give me instructionns\.  
**Mirja:** I'll take care of covering for Shichinosato Kofuki\. Nitta Hirona, you and Asakura Mihono will operate as a pair to handle the remaining small scale aradama\.  
**Mihono/Hirona:** Got it\!/\.\.\.Understood\.  
**Chie:** Good work, everyone\. That's our job here done\. It might not be so easy for us to work together at first, but let's keep at it, Nitta-san\.  
**Hirona:** The investigation team coordinates surprisingly well\. Even without clear signals, everyone moves so naturally\.\.\.  
**Yui:** We do have the cool and sexy Mirja-san commanding us\! And the investigation team goes on tons of missions together\!  
**Yui:** Besides, you're part of the team now too\. So, let's get to know each other really well so we get coordinated, Hirona-chan\!  
**Hirona:** Okay\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Uhh, um\.\.\. You don't have to go along with Yui-chan until you're used to dealing with her\.  
**Yui:** Don't be like that-, Kiyoka-chaaan\. You know I love you too-\.  
**Mihono:** You're really strong, Hirona\! I panicked after that aradama came after you before, but you're like super fast\!  
**Hirona:** I'm not that great\.\.\. When you saved me from that aradama, you seemed so much stronger to me\. I can't explain it well though\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** No way; you were all like\.\.\. Whoosh woosh woosh\! And it was so cool how you moved your sword, Hirona\!  
**Mihono:** Ah\. I just started calling you Hirona; are you okay with that\? We're in the same grade, so you should just call me Mihono too\!  
**Hirona:** Go ahead\.\.\. Then\.\.\. I'll call you Asakura-san\.  
**Mihono:** Don't you mean Mihono\!\? Well, you can say whatever's easier for you-\.  
**Chie:** I was a little worried at first, but it looks like things should be fine\.  
**Mirja:** I know\. I'm glad to see it\. The team can operate even more safely now\.  
**Kofuki:** This sucks\.\.\. I'm gonna get even less aradama-chan to pick from now\.  
**Mirja:** Considering the skills she's shown, that's likely the case\.  
**Kofuki:** But, that doesn't mean I'm giving any up without a fight\!  
**Chie:** Okay, when we get back, how about we give Hirona-chan her welcoming party\?  
**Kiyoka/Mihono/Yui:** Yeah-\!  

## 3: Nitta Hirona's Reasons
**Hirona:** Thank you\.\.\. for going this far for me\.  
**Chie:** We'd actually been meaning to cook something up to welcome you, but we couldn't find the time\. Though, the cakes here are delicious, aren't they\?  
**Hirona:** Yes\.\.\. They are\. I do like sweets a lot\. Moving your body and using your head requires sugar\.\.\. so it's very cost efficient\.  
**Kofuki:** That's just normal\. It'd be weirder if you were like somebody who doesn't care what stuff tastes like as long as it's got nutrition\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.\? Do you know someone like that\? You can't not eat food, so\.\.\. I think it's better for it to taste good\.  
**Mihono:** That's for sure\. This cake's yummy, but I wish we could've eaten Chii-nee's cooking too\.\.\. She's a really good cook\~\.  
**Hirona:** Is she-\? My senpai is great at cooking too-\.  
**Hirona:** Of course, I would like to try Setouchi-san's cooking too\.\.\. someday\.  
**Chie:** It doesn't have to be someday; we can do it soon\. Do you cook, Nitta-san\?  
**Hirona:** If I use a microwave or rice cooker\.\.\. I can cook some things\. There's lots of recipes you can use a rice cooker for nowadayys\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** But\.\.\. I've been eating out and getting food from convenience stores more lately\. If you think about the time required, it's very efficient\.\.\.  
**Chie:** If you want to eat healthy, it's better to cook for yourself, but we do get lots of missions, don't we\.  
**Mirja:** Come to think of it, have the two of you ever met at Osafune, or been assigned on the same mission\?  
**Chie:** I don't think we have\. Have we\?  
**Hirona:** No\.\.\. I don't think I've ever been in the same team as Setouchi-san\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** Speaking of Osafune, that uniform\.\.\. Nitta-san\.\.\. it suits you really well\.  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.You think so\? I can't really tell\.\.\. But, since having a uniform means I don't need to think about what to wear, I like having onee\. So much that I sometimes wear it on days off too\.  
**Hirona:** In a way\.\.\. uniforms are the most powerful clothes\.  
**Kiyoka:** Uniforms are cute, but that's such a waste\! You should come try on clothes with us sometime, Nitta-san\.  
**Hirona:** Still\.\.\. I can order online\.  
**Kiyoka:** It's so much better buying clothes in person though\! And it's really fun\!  
**Mihono:** Let's go do it\!  
**Hirona:** Alright thenn\.\.\.  
**Hirona:** (With personal relationships\.\.\. slow and steady is best\.\.\. and this is the investigation team\.\.\.\)  
**Yui:** Mmm\~, I can't wait-\! It doesn't get better than having more cuties around\!  
Several hours later--

  
**Yuuki:** Yuuki here\. How's everything going over there\? Please give your report\.  
**Hirona:** Thenn\.\.\. to start with\.\.\. there's a very high chance Asakura-san's power is what Makoto-san thinks\. And also\.\.\. everyone on the investigation team are good people\.  
**Yuuki:** Hm, okay\. I got it\. I'll make sure to let Makoto-nee-sama know\.  
**Hirona:** I'm a little surprised\.\.\.  
**Yuuki:** \? By what\?  
**Hirona:** I thought I'd be giving my report to Akira-san\.  
**Yuuki:** Oh, Akira-nee-sama said this was practice making contact and getting reports\. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you\. She said, \"Don't stand out too much\.\"  
**Hirona:** Okaay, keeping quiet is what I'm good at\.\.\. Hurray for energy efficiency\.  
**Yuuki:** Alright then; do your best out there, Hirona-san\! Akira-nee-sama and Makoto-nee-sama have high hopes for you\!  
**Hirona:** \.\.\.What about you, Yuuki-saan\?  
**Yuuki:** Well, sure I am\. If I had to put it like Akira-nee-sama, it's hardcore\. I have hardcore hopes for you\!  
**Hirona:** Hardcore-\? Fufu\.\.\.\.\.\. I'll try my beest\.  
**Yuuki:** If anything else comes up, let us know, okay\? I'm about to go to bed\.\.\. [yawn\]\.  
**Hirona:** Okaay, goodniight\.
