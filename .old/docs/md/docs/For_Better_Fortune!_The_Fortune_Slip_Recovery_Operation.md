## 1: For Better Fortune\! The Great Fortune Slip Recovery Operation - Prologue
--New Year's at the Asakura Shrine\. For the Asakura family, the busiest time of year has arrived\.

  
**Mihono:** Grandpa\! Is it just me, or are there a ton more visitors than last year\!\?  
**Asakura Yoshizumi:** I know\.\.\. I'm surprised too\. Who'd have guessed it'd work so well\.  
**Mihono:** Eh, you know why they're all here\!\? The shrine's packed with people wanting fortune slips\!  
**Yoshizumi:** You see, a friend of mine's a writer\. He asked me if he could use our shrine as a location in his latest novel\.  
**Yoshizumi:** It went on sale not too long ago, and won some kind of big award\. And now it's a hit that sold over a million copies\.  
**Yoshizumi:** In the story, the protagonist pays the Asakura Shrine a visit, and after he draws a fortune slip here, he starts turning his life around\.\.\. So it's thanks to that that we're so popular this year\.  
**Mihono:** I get one of our slips every year, so my life should be turning around all the time\!\!  
**Mihono:** Sorry, Chii-nee\.\.\. I called you over to mess around, but we got dragged into helping out with the shrine\.  
**Chie:** Fufu, don't worry about me\. It's a good sign for the start of the year, don't you think\?  
**Chie:** More importantly, if you don't refill the fortune slips you'll run out soon, won't you\?  
**Mihono:** You're right\! And the waiting line's still so long too\.\.\. I'll go grab some real fast\!  
**Chie:** Please do\.  
**Mihono:** Umm, I think we kept the fortune slips in the room out back\.\.\. Nn\? \.\.\.Ehhh\!\?  
**Aradama:** GYAAAAAAAAA\!  
**Mihono:** Why'd an aradama have to show up now\!\? Wait, it's getting into the bag of fortune slips\!  
**Mihono:** Just\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Give that back-\!\!  
**Aradama:** gyaaa\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** Pant, pant\.\.\. I got it, but\.\.\. It feels like there's way less in here than there used to be\.\.\.\!  
**Mihono:** Ah, Yui\? What's up\?  
**Yui:** You're never going to believe this\! I'm out on a walk with Kiyoka-chan right now, and we ran into an aradama, and I beat it, but, that aradama had a fortune slip for some reason\. And it was a great blessing too\~\!  
**Yui:** I'm so lucky\~, it sounds like this year I'll be getting way closer with Kiyoka-chan\~\.  
**Mihono:** THAT'S\.\.\. THAT'S MY FORTUNE SLIIIIP\~\!\!  
**Yui:** I get why you'd be jealous\~\! You want it too, don't you\! A blessing with Kiyoka-chan\! But, there's nothing you could do to make me hand this over, Mihono-chan\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Ah, wait\.\.\. If you're willing to do anything, then\.\.\.\! If you just do one little favor for me, I might think about letting you have this blessing, you know\?  
**Yui:** So\? What'll it be\~\? Fu\~ Fu\~ Fu\~  
**Mihono:** No, that's not what I meant\! That fortune slip came from here at the Asakura Shrine, and these aradama came and stole them\!  
**Yui:** Ehh\!\?  
**Mihono:** Please, Yui\! There might be other aradama with those fortune slips around where you are, so could you beat them and bring them back here\?  
**Mihono:** I'll head over there too\! And I'll give you a reward for helping me out\!  
**Yui:** Hey now, Mihono-chan\. We're closer than that, aren't we\~\! As soon as you asked, my answer was already OK\!  
**Yui:** Me and Kiyoka-chan are wearing furisode right now, so it's honestly hard for us to fight, but we'll do what we can to help\!  
**Mihono:** Thanks so much-\!\! I'll be right over, okay\!  

## 2: For Better Fortune\! The Great Fortune Slip Recovery Operation - Epilogue
**Mihono:** DYAAAAAA\!\!  
**Yui:** ORRYAA\!  
**Kiyoka:** E-Eii-\!  
**Mihono:** Phew\.\.\. I think we've gotten most of them back by now\. It took a while, so I hope things are okay back at the shrine\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Wow, I got another great blessing, Kiyoka-chan\! I think this is gonna be a great year for me\!  
**Kiyoka:** Hey, Yui-chan, stop opening those\! We're on a mission to recover them\!  
**Yui:** Ah\.\.\. Oh yeah, whoopsie\.  
**Mihono:** I'm so sorry I made you two help me out on your day off\! You really saved my butt here, so thanks\!  
**Yui:** We're friends; don't sweat it\! More importantly, when are you giving me that reward of yours, Mihono-chan\~\? After you teased me with it, I just can't calm down\.  
**Mihono:** Oh right, your reward\! Come on back to the shrine with me, you two\!  
**Yui:** Eh, what's that mean\? Is it something we can only do in a special situation\? I'm getting even more excited\~\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** Yui-chan\.\.\. I don't think she'll do what you're imagining\.  
**Yui:** Are you sure\? How exactly do you know what I'm imagining anyway\? What were you imagining, Kiyoka-chan\?  
**Kiyoka:** Fwaah\!\?\!\? I-I don't know\!\!  
**Mihono:** What are you two still standing around talking for\? Chii-nee's waiting for us, so let's go-\!  
**Yui:** Okaaay\~\.  
**Mihono:** Chii-nee, I'm really sorry I left you here for so long\!  
**Chie:** We were okay\. Anyway, did you get the fortune slips back\?  
**Mihono:** Yui and Kiyoka helped out, so we managed to get a lot of them\! Here you go, Grandpa\.  
**Yoshizumi:** Sorry to work you like that\. We should be able to get enough to all the visitors waiting now\.  
**Kiyoka:** Isn't that great, Mihono-chan\?  
**Mihono:** Yeah\! Oh, these are for you, Yui, Kiyoka, Chii-nee\!  
**Yui:** Thanks\! Ooh, a hagoita\! And it's painted all cute too\! [Hagoita are paddles used in hanetsuki, which is like badminton\]  
**Mihono:** Yeah, our shrine makes hagoita\! \.\.\.I suck at art though, so it's mostly Futaba and Sawano who did these\. Ehehe\.  
**Kiyoka:** I've never played hanetsuki before, but I'd like to try\!  
**Chie:** In that case, why don't we all play together\!  
**Mihono:** Sounds good\! Let's do it\!  
**Yui:** Alright-\! Let's make a competition out of it\! Winner gets Kiyoka-chan\! I'm gonna go all out\!\!  
**Kiyoka:** Eh-\? EhhhhHHHHH\!\?  

## 3: A Newcomer to the Investigation Team\.\.\.\?
**Tsugumi:** \.\.\.  
**Yui:** Oh\? I had a feeling that good looking girl over here was you, Tsugumi-san\!  
**Tsugumi:** Ah, Yamashiro-san\. Hello, how are you\?  
**Yui:** I'm doing great\! Anyway, why the long face\?  
**Tsugumi:** Hm\? Did I look upset about something just now\?  
**Yui:** Yep, without a doubt\! If something's bothering you, you're more than welcome to ask Yamashiro Yui for any advice\!  
**Tsugumi:** I hate to break it to you, but this is only my usual expression\. People often tell me they can't read what I'm thinking\.  
**Yui:** They do\.\.\.\!\? I'm sorry\! You're one of those cool beauty types, after all, Tsugumi-san\! That side of you still gets my heart racing\!  
**Tsugumi:** Thank you\.\.\. Still, that's right\.  
**Tsugumi:** Can I ask one favor of you\?  
**Yui:** Sure thing, lay it on me\. Whatever a cutie like you wants, I'll do anything to make it happen\.  
**Tsugumi:** To tell the truth, I'd like to try working together with your investigation team just once\.  
**Yui:** Huh\? The investigation team\?  
**Tsugumi:** Yes\. Lately, bit by bit, Shichinosato-san has been changing\.  
**Tsugumi:** She seems to have become more aware she can depend on those around her\.  
**Yui:** Uhh, that's a good thing though\.\.\. Right\?  
**Tsugumi:** Of course, I find it positive growth\.  
**Tsugumi:** Being able to manage one's own affairs is a vital skill, but the ability to work as a group is equally essential\. By adapting to what the situation asks, there's far more data at my disposal\.  
**Yui:** That's great\! So, what's that mean\?  
**Tsugumi:** I've grown interested in the investigation team that's changing Shichinosato-san\.  
**Yui:** So basically, you want to know more about us, who have been dealing with Kofuki-san\!  
**Yui:** Well, I feel you\! Name anything you want from me, Tsugumi-san\!\?  
**Tsugumi:** Please calm down\. I won't need any more than to analyze you when fighting\.  
**Yui:** Tsugumi-san's going to conduct a private analysis of me\!\? How can you expect me to calm down\!  
**Yui:** In that case, let's go see Mirja-san together\!  
**Yui:** If we tell her you want to come along with us, I'm sure she'll let us\!  
**Tsugumi:** Will it really go over that easily\?  
**Yui:** Probably\! Our next mission's up in some snowy mountain, so we have to start getting you ready now\!  
**Tsugumi:** A snowy mountain\? That would definitely require preparation\. Let's go, Yamashiro-san\.  
**Tsugumi:** Since I'll be going with you, I can count on you to look after me, can't I\?  
**Yui:** You'll be the one watching after me, won't you\! If all else fails, we can warm our naked bodies together\!  
**Tsugumi:** Fufu\. I highly doubt something like that would happen, but I'm looking forward to our mission together\.
