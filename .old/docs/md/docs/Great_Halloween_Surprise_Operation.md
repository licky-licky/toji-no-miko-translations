## 1: Great Halloween Surprise Operation Prologue
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.So we left the Halloween party to go scare Origami Yukari, right\?  
**Yomi:** Yes\. That is correct\.  
**Yomi:** At the party, Tsubakuro-san had the idea to put a jack o' lantern on her head, and made that a part of our plan to scare Yukari-sama\.  
**Yomi:** To make that happen, Tsubakuro-san strongly insisted that we go get enough pumpkins for all of us\.  
**Kaoru:** Right, that's what I thought\. \.\.\.So, does somebody want to explain to me what's going on\?  
**Ellen:** What do you mean, what's going on\?  
**Kaoru:** I mean, why're we just marching off out into the quiet countryside\!  
**Yume:** Because there's a pumpkin patch out here\.  
**Kaoru:** Huh\? You're not seriously planning on borrowing pumpkins from some farmer, are you\?  
**Kaoru:** It's scary what goes through a middle schooler's head\.\.\.  
**Yume:** You don't get it\~\! You sure are bad at listening\. The STT made a request to exterminate the aradama out here\!  
**Yume:** There's a pumpkin patch around here that aradama have been ruining, so we need to get rid of them\.  
**Kaoru:** Okay\. But suppressing aradama won't make them give us pumpkins\.  
**Yume:** Fu fuu\. You really don't get it, Onee-san\.  
**Yume:** Pumpkins come out of the aradama messing this place up\.  
**Kaoru:** Huh\? \.\.\.The heck is she saying\?  
**Yume:** I'm telling the truth\! They said it's okay if we take pumpkins that come from the aradama\!  
**Yomi:** I've reviewed the same request\. Whatever the reason, the aradama here seem to be consuming the field's pumpkins\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** When the aradama are purified, the pumpkins can be recovered\. However, they aren't fit for selling anymore, so we've been asked to discard of them if possible\.  
**Kaoru:** Huh\.\.\. And you want to take those pumpkins and make jack o' lanterns to scare Origami Yukari, right\?  
**Yume:** That's what I've been saying this whole time\!  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.You've really gotta work on your communication skills when it comes to not swinging an okatana around\.  
**Yume:** Eh\~, what's that supposed to mean\~\?  
**Aradama:** KISHASHASHASHASHA\!  
**Yume:** Spotted one already\! Tou-\!  
**Kaoru:** Wh-Whoa\.\.\. Seriously\? The aradama actually dropped a pumpkin\.  
**Yume:** See\! Just like I told you\!  
**Kaoru:** Nn\? \.\.\.Hold up\. There's something kinda wrong about this pumpkin, isn't there\?  
**Ellen:** What do you mean\? Let me see too\.  
**Ellen:** Oh\! It looks just like an aradama\!  
**Yomi:** On top of that, it's faintly glowing\. Did the noro cause this\?  
**Kaoru:** Well\.\.\. They're definitely not gonna be selling these\.  
**Ellen:** But these creepy pumpkins just might do the trick in scaring Yukari-sama\!  
**Kaoru:** Probably\. I like that it saves us the effort in making anything too\.  
**Yume:** I know, right\! Let's get a whole bunch so we can scare Yukari-sama\~\!  

## 2: Great Halloween Surprise Operation Epilogue
**Yume:** The pumpkin's\.\.\. All sticky\.\.\. It won't come off\.\.\. C'mon\.\.\.\!  
**Ellen:** Yukari-sama won't be able to work in here with it covered in pumpkin guts\! We should make sure her office is nice and tidy\!  
**Kaoru:** Sigh\.\.\. Working my body outside of a mission\.\.\. I feel like my guts are gonna come out too\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** Quit complaining and come lend a hand\! It's our duty as Team Scare\!  
**Kaoru:** Why does it seem like you're having a lot of fun with this\.  
**Yomi:** I never would have thought things could turn out like this either\.  
**Kaoru:** Ahhh, my back\.\.\. So after all that, did we actually scare Origami Yukari\?  
**Yomi:** I can't say for certain\. After all, the moment we jumped out from the mountain of aradama pumpkins wearing jack o' lanterns, she used dragonblade*\. (the name of Yukari's ougi\)  
**Ellen:** She didn't even let us finish shouting \"Happy Halloween\!\"\.\.\.\!  
**Kaoru:** Wasn't it right around the \"llo\" part that we ended up coated in pumpkin\?  
**Ellen:** I got all the way to \"wee\"\!  
**Yume:** But Yukari-sama didn't even twitch an eyebrow, did she\? Awww, I really wanted to see her face all surprised\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** However, regardless of how it turned out, we still had to do a great deal of apologizing\.  
**Yomi:** When it comes to Yukari-sama, maybe she shows her surprise by immediately leaping into action\.  
**Kaoru:** Maybe you're right\. Well, so long as we surprised her, I got what I wanted\. I'll gladly take this punishment in that case\.  
**Kaoru:** \.\.\.You know, you didn't have to stay with us till the very end\. I feel bad for dragging you along\.  
**Yomi:** You shouldn't be concerned with me\. I was complicit ever since I was unable to stop Tsubakuro-san\. And, besides\.\.\.  
**Yomi:** (Besides, I mabbe was likin it\.\.\.\.\.\.\)  
**Kaoru:** Besides\.\.\. What\? Nn\? Were you just smiling a little\?  
**Yume:** Ehh-\!\? Yomi onee-san, did you smile just now\!\?  
**Kaoru:** Yeah\.  
**Yomi:** I did not smile\.  
**Yume:** Yomi onee-san's smiling is just as crazy rare as Yukari-sama looking surprised\!  
**Kaoru:** Seriously\?  
**Yomi:** It is not\.  
**Yume:** It seriously is\! Aww, I wish I'd seen it\~\. Next time, you have to tell me when you're going to smile, okay\!  
**Yomi:** That's an unreasonable thing to ask of me\.  
**Ellen:** Pfft ahaha\! Halloween sure is a lot of fun\!  
**Kaoru:** For sure\. Now if only this cleaning would be over\.\.\.  
**Ellen:** That's right\. Let's give it one last push\!  

## 3: Halloween Party Prequel
One week before the Halloween party took place\.\.\.

  
**Yui:** Found you, Kiyoka-chan\! What're you two reading that's got you all excited\?  
**Mihono:** Oh hey, it's Yui\. Welcome back from your mission\! Take a look at this\!  
**Kiyoka:** The Halloween party's coming up, and remember how we were all going to get costumes\? Well this magazine just happened to be doing a special feature on them\!  
**Yui:** Ooh\~, what have they got\?  
**Kiyoka:** I was thinking, wouldn't I look cute in this Red Riding Hood outfit\!  
**Yui:** \.\.\.Nice\.\.\. That's nice, that's the best, Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Yui:** The way you understand your own type just makes me want to squeeze you tight, I mean it\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ahaha\.\.\.  
**Mihono:** There sure are a lot of different kinds of costumes though, aren't there-\! This one would look so good on Chii-nee\! And Mirja-san could probably wear this nurse outfit\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Mihono-chan, a nurse outfit isn't going far enough\. Mirja-san would really make you shiver in a doctor's uniform, wouldn't she\?  
**Mihono:** I guess\.\.\. You're right\? I don't really get what you mean\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Ahh-\! Hiyori-san has to wear this black cat costume\!  
**Yui:** If I saw Hiyori-san with those cat ears, I'd bury her in a mountain of candy\! Ahh\~, it's just too much\.\.\.  
**Kiyoka:** You sure have an active imagination\.\.\.  
**Academy Intercom:** Aradama have been identified in the area of this academy\. Toji, make preparations for emergency sortie\. I repeat, aradama have been identified--  
**Mihono:** Eh\!\? Right near here\!\? Kiyoka, Yui\! We've gotta go\!  
**Kiyoka & Yui:** Right\!  
**Child:** Mamaaaa--\!\!  
**Mihono:** There's a kid on the battlefield\!\? Everyone was supposed to get to shelter\!  
**Kiyoka:** Wh-What're we supposed to do\.\.\.  
**Yui:** I'll draw the aradama after me while you two get them to safety\! I'm going\!  
**Mihono:** Got it\! Be careful\!  
**Yui:** Ha\.\.\. With all these after me, they should be able to get away\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Now I just have to\.\.\. Alright\. How bout I clean you up myself\?  
**Yui:** *Inhale*\.\.\.  
**Yui:** URYAAAAAAAAA\!\!  
**Yui:** Mission complete\. Though, I can't forget to call in noro recovery and make a suppression report\.  
**Mihono:** Yui-\! We got them out of danger\! -Wait, did you beat them all yourself\!\?  
**Yui:** Did I do good-\? I've gotta try my best not to get left behind by everyone\.  
**Yui:** And thanks for getting that kid out of harm's way, Mihono-chan\!  
**Mihono:** No way, that was all thanks to you distracting the aradama\!  
**Mihono:** Besides, it's amazing you managed to beat them all like that by yourself\!  
**Kiyoka:** Pant, pant\.\.\. Sorry, I couldn't do anything to help again\.\.\.  
**Yui:** You took care of that kid, didn't you\? You helped out plenty, Kiyoka-chan\!  
**Kiyoka:** But\.\.\.  
**Yui:** Hmm, then, how about I ask you to do something for me, Kiyoka-chan\?  
**Kiyoka & Mihono:** Like what\?  
**Yui:** You can wear that Red Riding Hood costume later, but first, you should be a mummy all wrapped up in bandages\! And you'll have to take everything off\! And I'll help you get changed, of course\!  
**Kiyoka:** Ehhhhhhh----\!\? I don't want to\!\!  
**Yui:** Don't be like that, okay\? Come on, Kiyoka-chan\~\.
